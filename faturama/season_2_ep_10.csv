2,10,0,EINSTEIN,Let's disco dance Hammurabi!
2,10,0,HAMMURABI,Dy-no-mite!
2,10,0,LEELA,Sounds like your kinda place Fry. Wanna go?
2,10,0,FRY,Nah. If I ever wanna go back to the year 2000 I'll just freeze myself again.
2,10,0,BENDER,"C'mon Fry, I really wanna see it. You know how I yearn for a simpler time. A time of barn dances and buggy rides, before life was cheapened by heartless hi-tech machines."
2,10,0,LEELA,But Bender you are -
2,10,0,BENDER,Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah...
2,10,1,FRY,"Cool, it's just like the good old days!"
2,10,1,MUGGER,Give me your wallet or I'll cut you!
2,10,1,FRY,"Hey Leela, get a picture of me being ""mugged."""
2,10,1,MUGGER,I'll take the camera too.
2,10,1,BENDER,Learning is fun.
2,10,1,LEELA,"Ooo, ancient Wall Street."
2,10,1,STOCKBROKER #1,No!
2,10,1,STOCKBROKER #2,I'm ruined!
2,10,1,TOUR GUIDE,I direct your attention to this ancient and mysterious tablet which has yet to be deciphered.
2,10,1,LEELA,Do you know what it means?
2,10,1,FRY,"Yeah I asked a cop once. It means ""Up yours kid."""
2,10,1,BENDER,"I gotta say I'm really enjoying the day out with you people - Hey, a suicide booth! So long suckers."
2,10,1,FRY,"Uh, sorry Bender that's just a phone booth."
2,10,1,BENDER,Oh.
2,10,1,LEELA,What were they used for?
2,10,1,FRY,In New York? Bathrooms.
2,10,1,LEELA,Oh. I-I'll be out in a sec.
2,10,1,LEELA,Tokens only. How does this work?
2,10,1,FRY,I'll show you. Whup.
2,10,1,BENDER,"Ohh, it's a turnstile."
2,10,1,LEELA,What's this? Another bathroom?
2,10,1,FRY,"No, it's a mobile apartment with no rent."
2,10,1,BENDER,C'mon Fry get up!
2,10,1,LEELA,Wow! The burial chamber of the 20th century's greatest spiritual leader - Al Sharpton.
2,10,1,BENDER,Wow. Now this guy had taste!
2,10,1,LEELA,It says he was mummified in ceremonial vestments.
2,10,1,FRY,We sometimes called it a jogging suit.
2,10,1,NARRATOR,They traffic jams of Old New York were a public forum of free interchange of opinions.
2,10,1,NARRATOR,"It all started with Gerald Ford's famous invention, the ""automocar"" ......which was powered by a tank of burning fossils. Here we see a 20th century assembly line where cars were constructed by primative robots."
2,10,1,ROBOTS,Ooga ooga ooga ooga ooga ooga...
2,10,1,BENDER,We've come a long way baby!
2,10,1,NARRATOR,The fruit of the robots' labour was this......the stately 1992 Latoura.
2,10,1,FRY,"Hey, my girlfriend had one of those! Actually it wasn't her's it was her dad's. Actually she wasn't my girlfriend. She just lived next door and never closed her curtains."
2,10,1,LEELA,"Fry, remember when I told you about always ending your stories a sentence earlier?"
2,10,1,FRY,"C'mon, let's sneak in for a closer look."
2,10,1,MAN,"Sir, we don't touch the antiques sir. You - oh! I'm sorry. You work here. I should have realised from that ridiculous getup you're wearing."
2,10,1,FRY,"Hey! This is from Miller's Outpo - uh, I mean, yeah, I work here alright!"
2,10,1,MAN,"Here, move this rust bucket outside behind Saint Koch's cathedral."
2,10,2,LEELA,Did you drive much in the 20th century Fry?
2,10,2,FRY,Nope. No one in New York drove. There was too much traffic. Nice! Listen to that baby purr!
2,10,2,BENDER,There's a baby in there huh?
2,10,2,FRY,It's just like riding a bicyc -
2,10,7,BENDER,I think I got whiplash.
2,10,7,LEELA,"You can't have whiplash, you don't have a neck."
2,10,7,BENDER,I meant ass whiplash.
2,10,7,FRY,I'm just glad we hit something. I thought we'd never stop.
2,10,8,BENDING UNIT,Ow! I think I got whiplash.
2,10,8,FRY,How's that robot I ran over?
2,10,8,FARNSWORTH,We did all we could.
2,10,8,FRY,You mean he's -
2,10,8,FARNSWORTH,Good as new? Yes.
2,10,8,FARNSWORTH,"Leela, Zoidberg, the rest of you, this is Flexo."
2,10,8,HERMES,"Sweet llamas of the Bahamas! Except for that stylish beard, he looks just like Bender!"
2,10,8,FLEXO,"No duh dreadlock, we're both bending units."
2,10,8,BENDER,"Hey brobot, what's you serial number?"
2,10,8,3370318.,
2,10,8,BENDER,No way! Mine's 2716057!
2,10,8,FRY,I don't get it.
2,10,8,BENDER,We're both expressable as the sum of two cubes.
2,10,8,FRY,"So uh, Flexo. Sorry about crushing your body like that. You OK now?"
2,10,8,FLEXO,"Well I don't feel as bad as you look! Nah I'm just messing with you kid. You're alright. That's some face you got though, I think they got a cream for that. Nah, you're great."
2,10,8,FRY,Well just let me know if there's anything I can do to make it up to you.
2,10,8,FLEXO,Actually your little stunt did a number on my back. You mind rubbin' it for me?
2,10,8,FRY,Uh...sure.
2,10,8,FLEXO,"Aw yeah, that's it. A little lower."
2,10,8,FRY,How's that?
2,10,8,FLEXO,Lower. Yeah that's it. A little lower though.
2,10,8,FRY,Uh I can't get any lower than this.
2,10,8,FLEXO,"I'll say, you're rubbing my ass!"
2,10,8,ROBOT #1,"Hey, check it out here, six beautiful devices. They know what you like and they'll do it to within a tolerance of one micron!"
2,10,8,ROBOT #2,Yeah spin those fans baby!
2,10,8,ROBOT #3,Alright mama!
2,10,8,ROBOT #4,Gyrate baby!
2,10,8,FRY,I don't like this place. It's 120 degrees and there's very little oxygen.
2,10,8,BENDER,"Shut up and hoot. Hubba-hubba, she is built! In Mexico I believe."
2,10,8,FLEXO,And that ain't silicon. It's tungsten - and plenty of it!
2,10,8,FRY,"Uh, yeah. Look at that exhaust fan."
2,10,8,FLEXO,Eww!
2,10,8,BENDER,Pervert.
2,10,8,FLEXO,Yoo-hoo!
2,10,8,STRIPPERBOT,Thanks moderate spender. Please select erotic transaction.
2,10,8,FLEXO,"Yeah, how 'bout a lapdance for my pal here?"
2,10,8,FRY,"Uh, no, that's alright. Ow! Ow!"
2,10,8,FRY,I'm telling you there's something about Flexo I don't like.
2,10,8,FLEXO,"Hey Fry, think fast. Get it? It's chlorine!"
2,10,8,ZOIDBERG,It's funny because it's poisonous!
2,10,8,FRY,Yeah keep laughing brineshrimp but he's bad news. I regret ever running him over.
2,10,8,HERMES,Take a rage dump man. He's no worse than Bender.
2,10,8,FRY,"He's much worse. He drinks, he smokes and he posts naked pictures of me on the internet."
2,10,8,AMY,That's Bender alright.
2,10,8,FRY,I'm talking about Flexo.
2,10,8,LEELA,"Oh I get it, this is cute. You're jealous of Bender's new friend!"
2,10,8,FRY,No I'm not. Mark my words. Flexo's evil. He's the evil Bender.
2,10,8,HERMES,Rage dump!
2,10,8,FARNSWORTH,Everyone get in bed with me. I have something to show you. Feast your eyes on this!
2,10,8,LEELA,It's beautiful.
2,10,8,AMY,And huge.
2,10,8,FRY,Can I touch it?
2,10,8,ZOIDBERG,So what is it already?
2,10,8,FARNSWORTH,"It's a single atom of jumbonium. And element so rare, the nucleus alone is worth more than $50,000."
2,10,8,BENDER,How much more?
2,10,8,FARNSWORTH,"100,000. That's why I hid it here. Under my mattress."
2,10,8,LEELA,"Uh Professor, can we discuss this somewhere else?"
2,10,8,FARNSWORTH,Why certainly.
2,10,8,FARNSWORTH,"The atom sits atop this dime stored tiara which will be awarded to the winner of this years Miss Universe pageant on the planet Tova 9. Your job is to deliver it, safe and sound."
2,10,8,AMY,"Wow, when I was a little girl on Mars I dreamed of being Miss Universe."
2,10,8,LEELA,That's kinda pathetic.
2,10,8,AMY,Aw come on Leela. Deep down all girls wanna be Miss Universe.
2,10,8,LEELA,Not me.
2,10,8,AMY,Really? Maybe it's just cute girls.
2,10,8,FARNSWORTH,"Due to the atom's tremendous value, Planet Express would go bankrupt if it was stolen. Therefore we'll need to hire on additional security for the mission."
2,10,8,FLEXO,"Oh oh Mr Professor, right here!"
2,10,8,FRY,"Uh, maybe we should stick with people we know and trust. I mean, Flexo's great but -"
2,10,8,FARNSWORTH,Flexo's great you say? Well that's good enough for me. Welcome aboard lad.
2,10,9,LEELA,"Space banditos have been operating in this quadrant so you'll each take 8-hour shifts guarding the safe. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry."
2,10,9,FRY,"Wait, I don't like the sound of that. Let's just go alphabetically."
2,10,9,LEELA,
2,10,9,FRY,"Wait, let's go by rank."
2,10,9,LEELA,
2,10,9,FRY,Flexo outranks me?
2,10,9,FLEXO,"That's ""Flexo outranks me, sir""!"
2,10,9,BENDER,Halt. Who goes there?
2,10,9,FRY,Don't point that at me.
2,10,9,BENDER,Fry who?
2,10,9,FRY,"Look, I know Flexo's your friend but I don't trust him alone with the atom."
2,10,9,BENDER,"My God Fry just 'cause the guy's got a beard you label him as evil? Well I got a label for you pal. An ugly little word called ""prejudice."""
2,10,9,FRY,I'm not prejudiced.
2,10,9,BENDER,Ah save it for the cross burning Adolf!
2,10,9,FLEXO,Keeping an eye on the safe?
2,10,9,BENDER,You know it!
2,10,9,FLEXO,"Well, looks like it's my shift. You lie down and go offline for a while."
2,10,9,BENDER,Alright.
2,10,9,FRY,Caught you! I saw you looking at the atom!
2,10,9,FLEXO,So? I look at lots of atoms. Shouldn't you be resting up for your shift?
2,10,9,FRY,Oh-ho you'd like it if I went to sleep wouldn't you?
2,10,9,FLEXO,"Whatever it takes to shut your yapper. Nah, I'm just kidding you, you're a joker."
2,10,9,FRY,Yeah well here's a funny joke. I'm gonna sit right here till it's my shift.
2,10,9,FLEXO,Suit yourself skinbag.
2,10,9,FRY,That I will.
2,10,9,FLEXO,Good.
2,10,9,FRY,Good.
2,10,9,FLEXO,Good.
2,10,9,FRY,Good.
2,10,9,FLEXO,Good.
2,10,9,FRY,Good. Good.
2,10,9,FRY,"Well, that's eight hours."
2,10,9,FLEXO,"Yeah eight hours of solid boredom. Nah, I'm kidding, you're a wonderful man."
2,10,9,FRY,"Finally, the atom is safe."
2,10,10,LEELA,What is it? My God! Did you hear maracas?
2,10,10,FRY,No.
2,10,10,LEELA,"Then it wasn't space banditos. Bender, lock down the ship, don't let Flexo escape."
2,10,10,BENDER,Aye aye captain. It appears that Flexo has outwitted us all. Especially me...Bender.
2,10,10,LEELA,How could Flexo have stolen the atom?
2,10,10,FRY,He must have used a sleep ray on me. Sleep rays exist in the future right?
2,10,10,LEELA,No.
2,10,10,FRY,Then I must've fallen asleep.
2,10,10,LEELA,Well you were sure right about Flexo being evil.
2,10,10,BENDER,I locked down the ship but he may have already gotten away.
2,10,10,LEELA,
2,10,10,BENDER,"Roger that, I got a map of the ship right here."
2,10,10,LEELA,Keep an eye on Fry. We can't rule out the possibility that he did it.
2,10,10,LEELA,Aha!
2,10,10,FRY,Aha! Uh searching...hmm.
2,10,10,LEELA,Fry? Why are you looking for Flexo in my underpants drawer?
2,10,10,FRY,I didn't find him here 10 minutes ago so I thought it was time to check again.
2,10,10,BENDER,"Well, he wasn't in the uh, kitchen room."
2,10,10,FRY,"Say Bender, can I hold that map for a second?"
2,10,10,BENDER,Any leave me high and dry in case of a scavenger hunt? I think not.
2,10,10,FRY,Give it up!
2,10,10,BENDER,"Alright, take it. Sheesh."
2,10,10,LEELA,"Well, looks like Flexo got away clean."
2,10,10,BENDER,It's a darn shame.
2,10,10,LEELA,He must have jumped ship with the atom the second we landed.
2,10,10,FRY,"Or maybe, he never left at all! Wait a minute. You're Bender."
2,10,10,BENDER,"Of course, who said I wasn't?"
2,10,10,FRY,"But why were you wearing that scarf, that turtleneck and this fruity number?"
2,10,10,BENDER,"It's a little thing called ""style."" Look it up sometime."
2,10,10,BARKER,"Our ninth finalist, Miss Methane Planet; Halatina Smogmeyer. And our tenth and final finalist, Miss Earth's Moon, the Crushinator."
2,10,10,CRUSHINATOR,"Thank you Bob Barker, I'm as happy as a girl can be. End statement."
2,10,10,BARKER,Which one of these lovely womanoids will take home the lovely tiara?
2,10,10,LEELA,Downplay the tiara.
2,10,10,BARKER,"Uh, we'll find out after these subliminal messages."
2,10,10,BARKER,"So you lost the atom huh? You're garbage, human garbage! Do you braindead space jockeys have any idea how much that thing is worth?"
2,10,10,"100,000?",
2,10,10,"200,000?",
2,10,10,"200,001?",
2,10,10,BARKER,You're closest without going over.
2,10,10,FRY,"Well, we'll be leaving now. If you'll just sign this form saying you received the atom."
2,10,10,BARKER,I'm not signing squat. You find me that damn tiara before the pageant ends.
2,10,10,LEELA,But Mr Barker -
2,10,10,BARKER,"Enough out of you. I may be against the fur industry, but that won't stop me from skinning you alive! As long as no one wears the skin."
2,10,10,LEELA,"Well gentlemen, it appears we're boned."
2,10,10,FRY,Flexo!
2,10,10,LEELA,Get him!
2,10,11,BARKER,"Next up in what is generously called the ""Talent Competition,"" performing a traditional gangster rap, Miss - what the?"
2,10,11,BENDER,Got you!
2,10,11,WOMEN,Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
2,10,11,BENDER,"Shoot him, he's choking me!"
2,10,11,FLEXO,"No shoot him, he's choking me!"
2,10,11,LEELA,I don't know which one to shoot.
2,10,11,FRY,Flexo! Shoot Flexo!
2,10,12,AMAZONIAN,Women only room!
2,10,13,LEELA,"Alright, enough of this. There's the atom!"
2,10,13,BENDER,Aw jeez.
2,10,13,FRY,Bender? You stole the atom?
2,10,13,BENDER,"Yeah but I can explain, it's very valuable."
2,10,13,FLEXO,I saw him snatch it while Fry was asleep. That's why I ran to tell Bob Barker.
2,10,13,FRY,"Whoa whoa, you mean Bender is the evil Bender? I am shocked, shocked! Well not that shocked."
2,10,13,LEELA,"I'm sorry we suspected you Flexo. It's just, what with the beard and all."
2,10,13,FLEXO,"Don't even bother. You people sicken me. I put my life on the line to guard that atom and this is how you repay me? Well you can go rot for all I care. Nah, I'm just kidding, you guys are alright."
2,10,13,FRY,I'm so confused. The Bender I liked turn out to be evil and the Bender I hated was good. How can I live my life when I can't tell good from evil?
2,10,13,BENDER,"Eh, they're both fine choices, whatever floats your boat."
2,10,13,URL,Is this the guy?
2,10,13,BARKER,"Huh? Oh yeah, that looks like him. Whatever."
2,10,13,FLEXO,"Wait, but I -"
2,10,13,BARKER,Take him away.
2,10,13,BARKER,"Alright, let's put an end to this pathetic hoedown. Brannigan read the thing."
2,10,13,ZAPP,And the winner is...
2,10,13,LEELA,"It figures. Who else but Zapp Brannigan would be judging the most chauvinistic, degrading, dehumanising -"
2,10,13,ZAPP,Huh? Leela?
2,10,13,LEELA,"Wait, you're making a - Ooo! Look at that. I feel like a princess."
2,10,13,ZAPP,"Wait. What are you people, idiots? I'm still going mano a mano with this envelope. Miss Vega 4. There it is, Miss Universe. There it is, looking weird."
2,10,13,LEELA,I almost had that tiara.
2,10,13,BENDER,Me too.
2,10,13,FRY,"Well, you guys might both be losers but I just made out with that radiator woman from the radiator planet."
2,10,13,LEELA,"Fry, that's a radiator."
2,10,13,FRY,Oh. Is there a burn ward within 10 feet of here?
