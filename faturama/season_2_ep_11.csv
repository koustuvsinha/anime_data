2,11,0,"""RAGING BENDER""","By Lewis Morton Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
2,11,0,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, everyone. I've taught the toaster to feel love. And Hermes returns from his vacation today."
2,11,0,HERMES,"Good morning, people."
2,11,0,FRY,"Hey, Hermes!"
2,11,0,ZOIDBERG,Hello!
2,11,0,LEELA,Good to see you.
2,11,0,FARNSWORTH,Yo!
2,11,0,BENDER,My man!
2,11,0,AMY,So how was the Spleef Nebula?
2,11,0,HERMES,The flight had a stopover on the Brain Slug planet. Hermes liked it so much he decided to stay of his own free will.
2,11,0,FRY,Hermes has all the fun. Wait a second! He's got a Brain Slug on his head!
2,11,0,LEELA,Shh! You're gonna get us all assimilated!
2,11,0,AMY,Just act normal and switch to a garlic shampoo.
2,11,0,HERMES,On to new business. Today's mission is for all of you to go to the Brain Slug planet.
2,11,0,ZOIDBERG,What are we going to do there?
2,11,0,HERMES,Just walk around not wearing a helmet.
2,11,0,FARNSWORTH,"Sounds great, Hermes! Whatever you say. Let's ditch him and go to the movies!"
2,11,0,FRY,"Hey, yeah!"
2,11,0,ZOIDBERG,I'm seeing a movie with friends!
2,11,0,FRY,"Cool, let's see this one!"
2,11,0,LEELA,"Nah. I'm not in the mood for a historical documentary. I've heard good things about Quizblorg, Quizblorg."
2,11,0,AMY,Guk! I hate subtitles. Alien films are so pretentious.
2,11,0,ZOIDBERG,Fellows! Fellows! How about a film we can all enjoy? Planet Of The Clams. It's about an upside-down world where lobster is slave to clam.
2,11,0,BENDER,Who invited you? Let's just see All My Circuits: The Movie.
2,11,0,FRY,"Yeah, I wanna see that."
2,11,0,BENDER,"Good point, Bender."
2,11,0,FRY,I'll take a small Slurm.
2,11,0,REFRESHMENT-BOT,"For only 25 cents less, you can get a super-small."
2,11,0,FRY,"Uh, OK. Oh, man!"
2,11,0,BENDER,"Hey, gimmie a large diet malt liquor and a popcorn with extra motor oil."
2,11,0,FARNSWORTH,Down in front!
2,11,0,ANNOUNCER,Glagnar's Human Rinds presents: This Week In The Universe.
2,11,0,FRY,"Ooh, this is real futuristic!"
2,11,0,CROW T. ROBOT,Shh! Don't talk during the movie.
2,11,0,ANNOUNCER,"This week in the universe: New New York mayor C. Randall Poopenmeyer opens a new tube line to alleviate rush hour traffic. Dateline: Paramecium Homeworld. Newly-crowned Miss Universe Glady's Lennox entertains troops fighting to wipe out the human race. Go get 'em, boys! And in the world of Ultimate Robot Fighting, the Masked Unit wins his championship bout against Gorgeous Gonks by technical melting."
2,11,0,BENDER,"Go Masked Unit! Uh, hey, buddy! Yo! You mind taking your head off?"
2,11,0,ROBOT,"I'm sorry, sir, but I need it to watch the movie."
2,11,0,BENDER,Just ask Flabby over here to describe it to you later.
2,11,0,ROBOT,"Sir, she is as the factory made her."
2,11,0,BENDER,Well they should have stopped making her about halfway through.
2,11,0,FEMBOT,Whee!
2,11,0,CALCULON,"Well, that finishes this paperwork. Calculon Enterprises."
2,11,0,MONIQUE,"Calculon, a fight scene has broken out at the special effects warehouse. Come quickly before a fiery explosion chases someone down a hallway."
2,11,0,CALCULON,I have no choice but to--
2,11,0,ANNOUNCER,"If you want Calculon to race to the laser gun battle in his hover-Ferarri, press 1. If you want Calculon to double-check his paperwork, press 2. Enter now."
2,11,0,CHAIR,You have pressed 2.
2,11,0,FRY,No I didn't!
2,11,0,CHAIR,I'm almost positive you did.
2,11,0,CALCULON,"Add in the carryover from form 16A, then deduct line 2B..."
2,11,0,ROBOT,"Pardon me, sir. But you seem to be inadvertently kicking my seat."
2,11,0,BENDER,"""Pardon me, sir. But you seem to be bleh bleh..."""
2,11,0,ROBOT,"Yes, that's the gist of what I said. Would you mind?"
2,11,0,BENDER,"Sure thing, pal."
2,11,0,ROBOT,"Uh, sir?"
2,11,0,BENDER,Who threw that?!
2,11,0,ROBOT,"That's it! Sir, I challenge you to fisticuffs!"
2,11,0,BENDER,"Oh, I'm boned."
2,11,0,HATTIE,Let's all go to the lobby!
2,11,0,ROBOT,I'm gonna open a pile whup-ass on you!
2,11,0,LEELA,"Bender, do you know who that was?"
2,11,0,MAN #1,Cripes! The Masked Unit! You knocked him out cold.
2,11,0,MAN #2,I'm impressed.
2,11,0,DOUBLEDEAL,"Son, I'm the commissioner of Ultimate Robot Fighting. I'm a connoisseur of jerks like you who pick fights in movie theatres and you're the biggest I've ever seen."
2,11,0,BENDER,You should see me at funerals.
2,11,0,DOUBLEDEAL,"Kid, I want you in the Ultimate Robot Fighting League."
2,11,0,BENDER,Ultimate Robot Fighting? Sounds pleasant! I'll do it.
2,11,0,FLABBY,My hero!
2,11,0,FARNSWORTH,Aw. They don't make movies like this anymore.
2,11,0,BENDER,"I'm gonna be the greatest Ultimate Robot Fighter ever. Float like a floatbot, sting like an automatic stinging machine!"
2,11,0,AMY,"Bender, you can't be an Ultimate Robot Fighter. It's the most brutal form of competition in the galaxy!"
2,11,0,BENDER,It is?
2,11,0,FARNSWORTH,"There are no rules. Two robots enter, one robot leaves. Then later the other robot leaves after being declared the winner."
2,11,0,BENDER,"Well, that doesn't sound so bad."
2,11,0,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, did I mention the crippling, agonising pain? I'm pretty sure I did. Oh, yes, definitely."
2,11,0,BENDER,Crippling pain? That's not covered by my insurance fraud! Count me out.
2,11,0,LEELA,No! You've got to do it. I don't care how suicidal it is.
2,11,0,FRY,Hey! How come when I wanna do fun stuff that'll kill me you're against it?
2,11,0,LEELA,"This is more important than that marble-eating contest, Fry! It's about pride. Let me tell you a story from my childhood."
2,11,0,ZOIDBERG,"Oh, again with the orphanarium!"
2,11,0,LEELA,"When I was growing up at the orphanarium, I got picked on a lot..."
2,11,0,LEELA,...My only outlet was Arcturan Kung Fu.
2,11,0,FNOG,"Excellent. Bill, Keith, you will go to Junior Championships. Bill, congratulate Keith when he regains consciousness."
2,11,0,LEELA,"But, Master Fnog, I can beat these dorks with one eye closed."
2,11,0,FNOG,Perhaps. But there is more to winning than beating your opponent. You lack the will of the warrior.
2,11,0,LEELA,What do you mean? Watch this!
2,11,0,BILL,Ow!
2,11,0,FNOG,"No girl has the will of a warrior. You have the will of a housewife or, at best, the schoolmarm."
2,11,0,LEELA,That's it. I'll take you on right now.
2,11,0,FNOG,"Very well. But, you see, I have the will of the warrior. Therefore, the battle is already over. The winner? Me! Rematch? You lose again! Had enough? I thought so!"
2,11,0,LEELA,I lost my chance to be a champion. I won't let you throw away yours.
2,11,0,BENDER,Leela's right! I don't wanna end up a loser like her. Count me back in!
2,11,0,LEELA,Let's see what you got. Touch your toes.
2,11,0,BENDER,Still ... can't ... reach!
2,11,0,BENDER,Let's commence preparations for rumbling!
2,11,0,REFEREE,"Ladies and gentlemen and smizmars, welcome to tonight's main event. In this corner, from Mom's Friendly Robot Factory in America's heartland, Mexico: Bender! And in this corner, from and made of Parts Unknown: The Clearcutter!"
2,11,0,FRY,Bender rules!
2,11,0,HERMES,I got you an official Bender hat.
2,11,0,FRY,"Wow! Thanks, Hermes! I-- Hey! Cut that out!"
2,11,0,BENDER,You can't hit what you can't see!
2,11,0,LEELA,"Get up, Bender. You can't quit every time you get an axe in the back. Or a drill through your face. Now quit scratching your axe-hole and get out there."
2,11,0,BENDER,Huh?
2,11,0,REFEREE,And the winner is ... Bender!
2,11,0,DOUBLEDEAL,"Nice work out there, kid."
2,11,0,BENDER,"Y'know, I think I he might be dead. I took a life!"
2,11,0,CLEARCUTTER,"Hi, boss. Yo, dude!"
2,11,0,BENDER,"Hey, he's not dead. What's up with that?"
2,11,0,DOUBLEDEAL,"What, you didn't read the pamphlet? Ultimate Robot Fighting's a scam, kid. It's rigged. It's a secret so keep it under your head. But the most popular robot always wins."
2,11,0,BENDER,You mean I'm not a great fighter? I just won 'cause I'm popular?
2,11,0,DOUBLEDEAL,Bingo!
2,11,0,BENDER,Woo-hoo! I'm popular!
2,11,0,DOUBLEDEAL,"In fact, you're more than popular; You're pure lowest common denominator."
2,11,0,BENDER,Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
2,11,0,REFEREE,Presenting Bender the Offender!
2,11,0,BENDER,I'm just an ex-con trying to go straight and get my kids back.
2,11,0,REFEREE,Versus: Billionairebot!
2,11,0,REFEREE,Versus: The Foreigner!
2,11,0,FOREIGNER,I'm not from here! I have my own customs! Look at my crazy passport!
2,11,0,REFEREE,Versus: The Chain Smoker!
2,11,0,CHAIN SMOKER,I love smoking. And after I win the fight I'm heading straight to your favourite restaurant.
2,11,0,,[He blows smoke over the crowd. Bender takes a chair out of his chest cabinet and hits him with it then smokes a cigar.
2,11,0,BENDER,"You know, I'm also an Ultimate Robot Lover."
2,11,0,LEELA,Bender! You're three hours late. You can't give up on your training now after both of us worked so hard.
2,11,0,BENDER,"What do you mean, ""we""?"
2,11,0,LEELA,"I said ""us""."
2,11,0,BENDER,"Hey, Bender the Offender doesn't need you. Bender the Offender doesn't need anybody!"
2,11,0,FEMBOT #1,"What about us, Mr. The Offender?"
2,11,0,BENDER,Well obviously I need floozies! Let's roll!
2,11,0,BENDER,"Howdy, chief. For my next bout, what do you say I fight these two bimbos in some mud?"
2,11,0,DOUBLEDEAL,"Actually, we've decided to go in a different direction."
2,11,0,BENDER,What if I told your we wouldn't be fighting in the conventional sense?
2,11,0,DOUBLEDEAL,"Bender, your popularity is slipping."
2,11,0,FOREIGNER,Sales of your Bender Brand French milk bath soaps are down 20%.
2,11,0,BENDER,"Those morons! I said pea berry, not sandalwood!"
2,11,0,DOUBLEDEAL,"Damnit, Bender! If you can't move sandalwood, you don't belong in this league! That's why you're gonna lose next week's title match."
2,11,0,BENDER,But the crowd loves me.
2,11,0,DOUBLEDEAL,Perhaps. But let's see how they feel about your new persona: The Gender Bender.
2,11,0,BILLIONAIREBOT,You'll be the most unpopular robot fighter since Sergeant Faeces Processor.
2,11,0,BENDER,"Oh, yeah? Well what if I don't let the new guy win?"
2,11,0,DOUBLEDEAL,"Then he'll just have to beat you the old-fashioned way: To death! Melissa, send in the new kid."
2,11,0,DESTRUCTOR,I am Destructor!
2,11,0,BENDER,See you at the fight.
2,11,0,BENDER,"So then I said, ""See you at the fight"". And that's the story."
2,11,0,FRY,"Man, I thought Ultimate Robot Fighting was real, like pro wrestling. But it turns out it's fixed, like boxing."
2,11,0,BENDER,"It's one thing to win a fixed fight -- there's dignity in that. But to lose? And in this atrocity? I can't do it! Leela, you gotta train me to win."
2,11,0,LEELA,"No way! If you wouldn't take my help when you didn't need it, why should I give it to you now when you do need it?"
2,11,0,FARNSWORTH,What the hell are you talking about?
2,11,0,LEELA,I don't know. But I'm not helping.
2,11,0,ANNOUNCER,You loved him as Bender the Offender! Now get ready to hate him as he threatens your sexuality in his new persona ... The Gender Bender!
2,11,0,BENDER,I'm a real toughie!
2,11,0,ANNOUNCER,Squaring off this Sunday versus Destructor!
2,11,0,,[The picture is replaced with Destructor talking into a red phone.
2,11,0,DESTRUCTOR,I will destroy you! And stop calling me!
2,11,0,FNOG,"I am Destructor's trainer, Master Fnog. My pupil will be victorious for he has the will of a warrior!"
2,11,0,LEELA,"Not Fnog! Bender, let's hit the gym. I'm gonna teach you to fight like a girl!"
2,11,0,BENDER,I'll put on my tutu!
2,11,0,"""COSELL""","Hello and welcome to a remarkable championship bout. Destructor, a robotic armoured tank whose very use at battle has been ruled a war crime versus, Gender Bender, who wears a pink tutu. This is Rich Little imitating Howard Cosell, here at ringside with George Foreman. George, a word in edgewise?"
2,11,0,FOREMAN,This could be the most one-sided fight since 1973 when Ali faced an 80-foot tall mechanical Joe Frazier. M-My memory's not what it used to be but I think the entire Earth was destroyed.
2,11,0,LITTLE,"Interesting, if true. The Vegas odds tonight stand at an unprecedented 1000-0: A bet of $0 on Bender pays $1000 if he wins. Still, very few takers."
2,11,0,FOREMAN,It's not-not a smart bet.
2,11,0,LEELA,"According to the script, you're supposed to prance out and tickle him with your fairy wand. Instead, I want you to prance out and kick his head off!"
2,11,0,BENDER,"Got it. Large kickle, hold the tickle!"
2,11,0,HERMES,Thank God I'm free of that nightmare!
2,11,0,BENDER,"Sorry, buddy. Here you go!"
2,11,0,HERMES,Thank you. It was cold down there on the floor.
2,11,0,AMY,"Here, Professor, I got you a programme."
2,11,0,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, good. Just let me put on my reading glasses. Why, Zoidberg, there's a lovely photo of you in here."
2,11,0,REFEREE,"In this corner, the confused young robot with the golden curls weighing 525lbs: The Gender Bender!"
2,11,0,ZAPP,Boo!
2,11,0,NIXON,Get that hippie out of the ring!
2,11,0,REFEREE,"And in these two corners, weighing 400 tons, the gizmo from Pismo ... Beach, Destructor!"
2,11,0,FNOG,"So, we meet again. Most amusing: Girl who acts like fighter training fighter who acts like girl."
2,11,0,LEELA,"Keep laughing, Fnog! Ready, Bender?"
2,11,0,BENDER,"I was born ready! Gimmie the bell! Did you hear a noise? Final boarding call for flight 406, non-stop service to pain. Now boarding standby passengers--"
2,11,0,FOREMAN,"This seems like as good a time as any time to bring up my new grill for no reason. With its patented design, the fat drains directly into my mouth."
2,11,0,BENDER,"Fry! Throw in the towel! For God's sakes, Fry!"
2,11,0,HERMES,That's exactly what I was thinking.
2,11,0,BENDER,Mommy!
2,11,0,LEELA,
2,11,0,BENDER,Why won't anyone help me?
2,11,0,LEELA,"So, once more we meet again."
2,11,0,FNOG,Huh?
2,11,0,LEELA,"You didn't train Destructor. You're just controlling him like a puppet. I mean, cheating in a fake fight. That's low!"
2,11,0,FNOG,Better than being a girl. Like you. You're a girl!
2,11,0,LEELA,"Oh, right. Girls lack the will of the warrior!"
2,11,0,BENDER,Huh? It's bendering time! Take this. And this!
2,11,0,FNOG,You were an excellent student. Too bad I was a lousy teacher!
2,11,0,,[He fights back. Destructor copies and beats up Bender some more.
2,11,0,BENDER,"I think you misunderstood the concept of ""bendering time""!"
2,11,0,FNOG,See you in girl hell. I'll be in boy hell -- much nicer!
2,11,0,LEELA,Yes!
2,11,0,BENDER,Yes! Oh!
2,11,0,REFEREE,And the winner is Destructor!
2,11,0,LITTLE,I've not seen a spectacle of this nature in all my years impersonating a sportscaster.
2,11,0,FOREMAN,"It sure was some fight. Interesting side note: As a head without a body, I envy the dead."
2,11,0,LITTLE,No argument here.
2,11,0,FRY,Bender? How did the fight go? I heard somebody got flattened!
2,11,0,AMY,"Fry, where's your Brain Slug?"
2,11,0,FARNSWORTH,Poor little guy starved to death.
2,11,0,LEELA,"I'm proud of you, Bender. Sure, you lost. You lost bad. But the important thing is I beat up someone who hurt my feelings in high school."
2,11,0,BENDER,I'm in tremendous pain here.
2,11,0,DOUBLEDEAL,"Great job, kid. You lost and you made it look almost half real. I want you to have this card good for 10% off at Bed Bath & Beyond."
2,11,0,BENDER,Yes! I'm the greatest! The greatest!
2,11,0,LITTLE,And so ends the chronicle of one of the greatest ever to play the sport.
2,11,0,FOREMAN,And he didn't look half bad in the tutu.
2,11,0,LITTLE,That he did surely not.
2,11,0,FOREMAN,What?
