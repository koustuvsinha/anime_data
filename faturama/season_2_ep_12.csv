2,12,0,"""A BICYCLOPS BUILT FOR TWO""","By Eric Kaplan Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
2,12,2,FARNSWORTH,"Good news everyone! Several years ago I tried to log on to AOL, and it just went through! Wheee! We're online!"
2,12,2,FARNSWORTH,Go ahead! Get into these net suits. I designed and tested them myself.
2,12,2,LEELA,It smells like burning recess monkey.
2,12,2,FARNSWORTH,Really? I guess when you're around it all day you stop noticing. Off you go.
2,12,3,FRY,Hey!
2,12,3,BENDER,Behold! The internet!
2,12,4,FRY,My God! It's full of ads!
2,12,4,LEELA,Follow me!
2,12,4,FRY,It's immense.
2,12,4,LEELA,It's got every piece of information anyone could ever want.
2,12,4,FRY,So I see!
2,12,4,ZOIDBERG,What? What's going on here?
2,12,4,AMY,"Hey, that's me!"
2,12,4,BENDER,No it isn't. I just took some pictures of your face and stuck them on someone else's body.
2,12,4,LEELA,Hey!
2,12,4,MAN,Are you over 18?
2,12,4,KID,Yes.
2,12,4,YOUNGER KID,Yes.
2,12,4,BENDER,I'm telling you Fry they've got a chatroom for everybody. And here it is.
2,12,4,AMY,"Ew, that is so gross!"
2,12,4,LEELA,Yeah. I'll stick with this one thank you.
2,12,4,AMY,Yeah.
2,12,4,BENDER (SEXFULLY),"Hi, I'm a naughty nurse and I really need someone to talk to. 9.95 a minute."
2,12,4,MAN #2,"Ooo, you're a dollar naughtier than most."
2,12,4,BENDER,So how 'bout them Knicks?
2,12,4,NERD #1,Hello? Are there any girls in this room at all?
2,12,4,NERD #2,"Yeah, bring on the hot chicks 'cause I'm a hot stud."
2,12,4,NERDS,Yeah!
2,12,4,NERD #3,So are we!
2,12,4,LEELA,"I'm a woman if that's what you mean. I don't like to play games so I'll just say I'm a cyclops, I'm a spaceship captain, I'm the only one of my species and I'm interested in meeting a man."
2,12,4,NERD #4,A woman. I'm scared.
2,12,4,FRY,"Well, thanks to the internet, I'm bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?"
2,12,4,BENDER (SARCASTIC),Is the space pope reptilian?
2,12,4,HERMES,Get ready for fun Fry. Nowadays we have a type of game played entirely on video.
2,12,4,LEELA,"We call it a ""video game."""
2,12,4,FRY (SARCASTIC),"Uh, ""video game"" you say? Well golly gee, you mighty spacemen of the future will have to show me how it works."
2,12,4,ZOIDBERG,The doctor is in! The doctor is out.
2,12,4,FARNSWORTH,"Everyone please sign off, we have a delivery. Plus I have to use the phone - Leela please tell the others that"
2,12,4,LEELA,Who are you?
2,12,4,CYCLOPS,I saw you in the chatroom but you left before I had a chance to talk to you. After all these years of searching for another Cyclops.
2,12,4,LEELA,I can't believe it. I've dreamed of this moment all my life.
2,12,4,CYCLOPS,Do you think perhaps you and I - ?
2,12,4,LEELA,"Fry, you idiot. Ever since I was abandoned on Earth I've been searching for who my people are and where they come from. Then I finally meet another Cyclops and you blast him. You wrecked my one chance to learn who I am."
2,12,4,FRY,Oh Leela. I feel terrible. If there's anything I can ever do - Gotcha! I won! I'm the greatest!
2,12,5,LEELA,Come on. We have worked to do.
2,12,5,FRY,Are you still mad at me for wrecking your once in a lifetime chance to learn the meaning of your existence?
2,12,5,LEELA,"No, I'm just happy you were able to win a video game. Now lets concentrate on getting this desperately needed popcorn to the people of Cineplex 14 OK?"
2,12,5,VOICE,"Leela, you've got mail. It's not spam!"
2,12,5,LEELA,Huh? It's him!
2,12,5,CYCLOPS [ON SCREEN],To: Leela. Subject: Hello. I am Alkazar. Fortunately I wrote down your screenname before I was dispatched by that oaffish moron.
2,12,5,FRY,Kicked your ass!
2,12,5,ALKAZAR [ON SCREEN],Leela we have much to discuss. Please come join me on the planet of your birth. Co-ordinates follow.
2,12,5,FRY,Too bad we gotta make that urgent popcorn delivery.
2,12,5,LEELA,It'll get there.
2,12,6,LEELA,After a whole life of searching I may finally have found where I belong.
2,12,6,BENDER,Too bad it's a dump.
2,12,6,LEELA,Look at that statue. It's only got one eye.
2,12,6,FRY,Lazy sculptor!
2,12,6,ALKAZAR,Welcome home Leela.
2,12,6,LEELA,Alkazar? Are you real? Or am I seeing single?
2,12,6,ALKAZAR,Ow! Of course I'm real!
2,12,6,LEELA,"After all this time. Somebody else with one eye who isn't a clumsy carpenter or, uh, a kid with a BB gun."
2,12,6,ALKAZAR,It's alright Leela. You'll never be alone again. Let me introduce you to yourself. Do you mind if your servants walk?
2,12,6,LEELA,Not at all!
2,12,6,ALKAZAR,"We are the last remaining Cyclopses. Our planet is Cyclopia. This is our capital, Cyclops City. Stop me if I'm going too fast for you."
2,12,6,LEELA,There's so much information and yet somehow I feel as if I know it all already.
2,12,6,ALKAZAR,This sacred mosaic depicts our goddess of beauty.
2,12,6,FRY,"Hmm, you got any sacred artwork of her from the back?"
2,12,6,ALKAZAR,"Her perfect eye reminds me of yours Leela. Had our race survived, you would have been a temple priestess or a supermodel."
2,12,6,LEELA,Oh please! Really?
2,12,6,ALKAZAR,"And there's the pirate Purple Beard, scourge of the six seas."
2,12,6,FRY,What's over that hill?
2,12,6,ALKAZAR,The Forbidden Valley. A holy sancturary where no one may tread.
2,12,6,FRY,Is that anything like a cemetary 'cause I gotta take a leak. Ow!
2,12,6,LEELA,"Fry, that's offensive to our people. Isn't it?"
2,12,6,FRY,Ow!
2,12,6,ALKAZAR,This is my home. I hope you don't think less of me because I live in a giant castle.
2,12,6,LEELA,"Oh no not at all. If anything, I'm more impressed."
2,12,7,BENDER,Ooo! I'm gonna need to make some room!
2,12,8,ALKAZAR,In here's where I dream my lonely dreams and cook my simple meals.
2,12,8,LEELA,It's all so sad. What happened to our people?
2,12,8,ALKAZAR,"Its too painful to speak of now. Come, I'll show you your quarters."
2,12,8,BENDER,Ow! Ow! Ow!
2,12,9,LEELA,I heard you from my room. What's wrong?
2,12,9,ALKAZAR,It's just - no Leela. I don't want to see tears in your perfect eye.
2,12,9,LEELA,"Please, is it bout the fate of our people? Because I'm very interested in that."
2,12,9,ALKAZAR,Well OK. But it's chilly and you're going to be all wet from the tears. Let's go into my chamber.
2,12,9,ALKAZAR (VOICE OVER),It wasn't long ago. Our people were happy and prosperous...
2,12,9,ALKAZAR (VOICE OVER),...but the eyeless mole people of Subterra 3 grew jealous of our visual proness. They fired missile in all directions hoping to hit Cyclopia.
2,12,9,ALKAZAR (VOICE OVER),"Unfortunately, one of the 40 planets hit, was ours."
2,12,9,CYCLOPIAN,How far away do you think it is?
2,12,9,SCIENTIST,A trillion miles?
2,12,9,ALKAZAR,"Things got hot. You look a little hot, you can take off that jacket. Our people don't like to be hot. Anyway, just before the impact..."
2,12,9,ALKAZAR (VOICE OVER),Our smartest scientists managed to save one baby
2,12,9,LEELA,"Alkazar, I used to be a baby, it might have been me!"
2,12,9,ALKAZAR (VOICE OVER),"Fortunately I was employed as a pool cleaner at the time and when I emerged from retrieving a dead possum, I found I was the only one left."
2,12,9,LEELA,It's so tragic.
2,12,9,ALKAZAR,"Yes, but the real tragedy is that our race ends with us."
2,12,9,LEELA,It doesn't have to.
2,12,9,ALKAZAR,What do you mean?
2,12,9,LEELA,You're a male and I'm a female.
2,12,9,ALKAZAR,I'm still not following you.
2,12,9,LEELA,Wake up my king.
2,12,9,ALKAZAR,Oh jeez what a night. Make me some coffee would you.
2,12,9,LEELA,"Uh, sure OK. What do you take with that?"
2,12,9,ALKAZAR,"Pancakes and sausage. Kitchen's in the basement, pans are in the attic."
2,12,9,LEELA,Maybe after breakfast we can talk about rebuilding our civilisation.
2,12,9,FRY,Mmm! Great pancakes Leela!
2,12,9,ALKAZAR,"Yeah they'll come in handy if I need to cover any tiny manholes. Listen hun, we don't want to look like slobs in front of the other species do we?"
2,12,9,LEELA,No.
2,12,9,ALKAZAR,So get to work on these dishes. And then organise my collection of naked celebrity photos by name and what you can see.
2,12,9,LEELA,Look Alkazar.
2,12,9,ALKAZAR,Call me Al.
2,12,9,LEELA,Look Al. I know you've been living alone a long time and I can sympathise but I'm not your maid.
2,12,9,ALKAZAR,"You're right, I'm sorry. It looks like the relationshipisn't going to work afterall. So much for the Cyclops race. I thought it was a pretty good race but -"
2,12,9,LEELA,
2,12,9,BENDER,"Ah, Leela's experiencing the greatest joy a woman can feel: Worshipping some lowlife jerk."
2,12,9,FRY,He may be some lowlife jerk but I don't trust him. I think he's hiding something and I'm gonna find out what it is.
2,12,9,FRY,Try and stop me!
2,12,9,LEELA,Al? I did my hair the way you wanted it. Who are these people?
2,12,9,ALKAZAR,Friends.
2,12,9,LEELA,"Hey, where'd you get this couch and that TV set and all this stuff?"
2,12,9,ALKAZAR,They were giving it away on the street corner. Just like you Leela.
2,12,9,LEELA,"Too bad they weren't giving away the three things you actually need: Mouthwash, a back wax and stain-proof underwear."
2,12,9,RAT WOMAN,You go girl!
2,12,9,ALKAZAR,By the way your pal Fry fell into the dungeon. Feed him a taco so he doesn't die and stink up the place.
2,12,9,LEELA,"Come on Al, can't you let the little guy out?"
2,12,9,ALKAZAR,"Jeez Leela, twice in one day? I'm not Superman!"
2,12,9,LEELA,Why were you sneaking into my people's forbidden valley?
2,12,9,FRY,"'Cause I think Alkazar's hding something. Listen Leela, you may not like it, you may not believe it, you may not wanna hear it but Alkazar's a jerk, he's bad for you. He -"
2,12,9,LEELA,I know.
2,12,9,FRY,You do?
2,12,9,LEELA,Fry if it's obvious to you with your learning disability then of course it's obvious to me! He's crude and gross and he treats me like a slave.
2,12,9,FRY,Then dump his one eyed ass.
2,12,9,LEELA,I can't. If I leave Alkazar then that's the end of the Cyclops race. And I won't let that happen. Even if that means a lifetime of unhappiness.
2,12,9,LEELA,I'll break up with him at dinner.
2,12,9,FRY,I'll be there.
2,12,9,ALKAZAR,"Yo Leela, what gives? Pig says your slop tastes like crap."
2,12,9,PIG,"Yeah, like crap."
2,12,9,FRY,C'mon Leela you deserve better than this guy! Dump him already!
2,12,9,LEELA,I'm trying.
2,12,9,ALKAZAR,"Hey everyone jam a sock in your spit faucets. Not long ago I spent my lonely nights renting slash flicks with Rat Man and his girlfriend. But then a beautiful woman arrived and - stop eating pig! And she brought new hope for me and our once great civilisation. Now a million centuries of Cyclops destiny depend on the answer to one question......Leela, will you marry me?"
2,12,9,FRY (WHISPERING),No! No!
2,12,9,LEELA,Yes! I Will!
2,12,9,FRY,Ohh!
2,12,9,RAT WOMAN,They're getting married!
2,12,9,AMY,Congratulations Leela!
2,12,9,ZOIDBERG,Hello!
2,12,9,HERMES,Oh this is great!
2,12,9,FRY,"Pst, Leela. you've got to get me out of here. It's horrible, eating scraps, letting my waste drop wherever it falls like an animal in the zoo."
2,12,9,LEELA,Animals go in the corner.
2,12,9,FRY,The corner! Why didn't I think of that?
2,12,9,LEELA,"Look Fry I'd like to help you but it's my wedding and I'm kind of busy. Here, try to be happy for me. That way at least one of us will be."
2,12,10,FRY,That's it! It's time for this bird to walk.
2,12,11,FRY,Bender come on. We've got to get some dirt on Alkazar. Lets go and find out what makes the Forbidden Valley so forbidden.
2,12,11,BENDER,Uh no thanks I'm good.
2,12,11,FRY,But there's probably some cool forbidden stuff you can steal.
2,12,11,BENDER,I don't know Fry. For the first time in my life I feel like I've stolen enough.
2,12,11,FRY,"Bender, snap out of it!"
2,12,11,BENDER,"Sorry I don't know what came over me. Let's go. I love stealing, I love taking things!"
2,12,11,ZOIDBERG (CRYING),That pig over there is wearing the same sandals as me.
2,12,11,FRY,"Come on boy, jump! Good boy!"
2,12,12,BENDER,Whoa Mittens!
2,12,12,FRY,My God! Four identical castles!
2,12,12,BENDER,Each more identical than the last!
2,12,12,FRY,"That's weird. It's another Cyclops, only this one has five eyes."
2,12,12,BENDER,And here's another one with no eyes.
2,12,12,PREACHERBOT,Does anyone have a reason why this couple shall not be joined in the irrevocable shackles of holy bliss?
2,12,12,FARNSWORTH,Saving a race of one-eyed monsters? Who could object to that?
2,12,12,ALKAZAR,Cut to the chase Preach!
2,12,12,PREACHERBOT,Do you Alkazar......takethiswomanbeforeyou...tolove..insickness..do you part?
2,12,12,ALKAZAR,Yeah sure I do come on faster!
2,12,12,PREACHERBOT,"Do you Leela, copy and paste his response til death do you part?"
2,12,12,LEELA,I..d -
2,12,12,AMY,Oh my God!
2,12,12,ALKAZAR,What the?
2,12,12,FRY,"Hey Alkazar, you left somebody off the guest list."
2,12,12,5-EYES,"Alkazar, why you are so late for our wedding? And why you have only one eye?"
2,12,12,ALKAZAR,"It, uh, oo! Uh, hey sweetie, just go back to the castle and wait for me. She, she's nuts, I can morph into a 5-eyed alien and I kinda said I'd marry her. But I'm really a Cyclops and I'm really going to marry you."
2,12,12,FRY,Oh yeah? Then what about this?
2,12,12,ALKAZAR,This is a bit awkward.
2,12,12,5-EYES,Who's she?
2,12,12,LEELA,Who's she?
2,12,12,SANDY,Who are they?
2,12,12,ALKAZAR,Go back to the castle Sandy.
2,12,12,FRY,And maybe you'd like to meet her. And her.
2,12,12,ALKAZAR,"Leela, this must all be ver confusing."
2,12,12,LEELA,A little. That's why I've decided to hurt you until you explain it.
2,12,12,SANDY,Show us your real form!
2,12,12,LEELA,Yeah!
2,12,12,THING #2,Do it!
2,12,12,ALKAZAR,"Well, this is the real me. But I can explain. We all have needs. Mine was to make it with five weirdos and have them scrub my five castles. I gave you all what you wanted and of course I made a few bucks letting Pig watch through the two way mirror. Can any of you sa you wouldn't have done the exact same thing in my position?"
2,12,12,BENDER (CRYING),He's a saint!
2,12,12,LEELA,But why did you have all five weddings on the same day?
2,12,12,ALKAZAR,"Hey lady, you got any idea how much it costs to rent a tux that changes shape?"
2,12,12,LEELA,"Alright Alkazar, I just have one last question for you."
2,12,12,ALKAZAR,What's that?
2,12,12,LEELA,"If you can change form, why didn't you change it in the one place that counts?"
2,12,12,LEELA,Thanks for saving me from that creep Fry.
2,12,12,FRY,"Hey, that's what I do."
2,12,12,LEELA,"I guess I was so desperate to find out who I really was, I forgot who I really was."
2,12,12,FARNSWORTH,"No harm done. In the many decades you'll work to repay me for that shipment of popcorn you destroyed, you'll have plenty of time to search for your true home."
2,12,12,LEELA,"Yeah. I mean, how many planets can there be?"
