2,13,0,"""HOW HERMES REQUISITIONED HIS GROOVE BACK""","By Bill Odenkirk Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
2,13,0,HERMES,"Finally, the last form of the day. Welcome to stampy-town. Population - five! And now for the finishing touch. Ah, the cycle of bureaucracy. Sweet gorilla of Manila! A letter from the Central Bureaucracy! Attention Hermes Conrad, you are about to recieve a letter from the Central Bureaucracy. My God! It's from the Central Bureaucracy!"
2,13,0,LEELA,I'm having a poker game tonight with some friends from my old cryogenics job. You guys interested?
2,13,0,BENDER,I don't know. I only gamble with chumps.
2,13,0,FRY,I'll play.
2,13,0,BENDER,I'm in.
2,13,0,ZOIDBERG,"Leela, Fry, robot. No matter what it is you're doing tonight, I'm available."
2,13,0,LEELA,"We're playing poker. but I'm warning you, my friends are serious players."
2,13,0,ZOIDBERG,"Bah, big shots. I say let the dice do the talking."
2,13,0,FRY,"Wow, you look happy. Is someone fired?"
2,13,0,HERMES,"Better. The Central Bureaucracy is conducting an inspection tomorrow. I'll finally be promoted to grade 35, the 35th highest grade there is."
2,13,0,LEELA,"Hermes, wait! We're having a poker party. Stay and whip off a batch of your famous jerk dip."
2,13,0,HERMES,Sorry. I spent all day putting my office in order. Now I got to go home and relax the traditional Jamaican way - a glass of warm milk and good night sleep.
2,13,0,FRY,Jamaican? I thought you were some kinda outer space potato man.
2,13,0,LEELA,Ah that must be my old boss.
2,13,0,IPGEE,"Hello Leela, you're fired."
2,13,0,LEELA,I know.
2,13,0,IPGEE,I'm sorry but it's just that you're over a year late for work at this point.
2,13,0,TERRY (DRAMATICALLY),Let the games begin!
2,13,0,IPGEE,"So I told Leela, ""Your request for a date is most flattering but I must decline."" These office romances never work out. Afterall, that is how I met my horrible wife."
2,13,0,LEELA,But you never wore your ring. I didn't know you had a wife.
2,13,0,IPGEE,And my wife doesn't know I have a job. I keep my personal and professional lives serparate.
2,13,0,BENDER,"C'mon, let's deal. You'll have plenty of time to talk when you're poor."
2,13,0,FRY,What's with the specs Bender?
2,13,0,BENDER,They're my lucky shades. I stole them off some lucky guy while his lucky seeing eye dog was taking a whiz.
2,13,0,FRY,Hey!
2,13,0,ZOIDBERG,I can't spell anything with these cards.
2,13,0,ZOIDBERG,"Finally, I have a good claw. See? Three human females, a number and a king giving himself brain surgery."
2,13,0,FRY,"It doesn't matter how many human females you have, Bender's on a hot streak."
2,13,0,BENDER,"Uh, what can I say? Must be my lucky shades! Nothing, nothing, crap, crap, garbage. Read 'em and leak saltwater!"
2,13,0,FRY,Oh man!
2,13,0,TERRY,My baby's milk money!
2,13,0,IPGEE,Oh I am broke. What will I tell my horrible wife?
2,13,0,BENDER,If I were you I'd be more worried about that tapeworm going to town on your intestines.
2,13,0,IPGEE,Let me see those glasses.
2,13,0,BENDER,Um...uh...
2,13,0,IPGEE,Oh my various gods! X-Ray specs!
2,13,0,BENDER,"Guys, I swear those are prescription. I need them for reading stuff - on the other side of stuff."
2,13,0,LOU,Cheater!
2,13,0,IPGEE,Get him!
2,13,0,TERRY,Break his neck!
2,13,0,ZOIDBERG,No don't hurt him! He's my best friend!
2,13,2,HERMES,Great cow of Moscow!
2,13,3,BENDER,"Uh, it was ghosts! Big ones! And a tornado!"
2,13,3,HERMES,Oh! I'll never pass inspection now! They'll bust me lower than a limbo stick - at carnival time. And that's as low as limbo sticks get.
2,13,3,FRY,Aw hey c'mon don't worry. We'll watch you clean up.
2,13,3,HERMES,It's too late. The inspector will be here in exactly one second.
2,13,4,HERMES,Who the hell are you?
2,13,4,MORGAN,"Morgan Proctor, bureaucrat grade 19."
2,13,4,HERMES,"Hermes Conrad, bureaucrat grade 36."
2,13,4,MORGAN,Enough friendly banter. Shall we begin the inspection?
2,13,4,HERMES,This way please.
2,13,5,FRY (WHISPERING),"Jeez Hermes, you seem awfully calm about this."
2,13,5,HERMES (WHISPERING),Don't worry. I have a plan.
2,13,5,HERMES (SHOUTING),I'm going to jump!
2,13,5,AMY (SHOUTING),No!
2,13,5,ZOIDBERG (SHOUTING),No!
2,13,5,BENDER (SHOUTING),Do a flip!
2,13,6,LEELA (SHOUTING),Don't do it Hermes! You have so much to live for!
2,13,7,,Farnsworth ...Other people need it you know.
2,13,7,LABARBARA (SHOUTING),Husband! Nooo!
2,13,8,HERMES,Outta my way wife...!
2,13,9,HERMES,
2,13,9,MORGAN (SHOUTING),Bureaucrat Conrad...!
2,13,10,MORGAN (SHOUTING),"...If you complete your death transaction with out filing a suicide and/or falling accident permit, you will be posthumously demoted."
2,13,11,HERMES,Life. Death. Either way I'm demoted to a tiny cubicle.
2,13,11,HERMES,Sweet something of...of someplace.
2,13,11,MORGAN,As your superior I hereby relieve you of duty. Consider yourself on paid vacation.
2,13,11,HERMES,Oh! The ultimate penalty.
2,13,11,ZOIDBERG,"I recommend the health cure on Spa 5, the sauna planet. Here, read."
2,13,11,LABARBARA,Spa 5? Is it good?
2,13,11,ZOIDBERG,"Oh, it's wonderful! I don't know anything about it but they send me a bucket of krill for every patient I send."
2,13,11,MORGAN,"Naturally I'll have to assign a bureaucrat to fill in for Hermes while he's away. I assign me, I accept, welcome aboard."
2,13,11,ZOIDBERG,Then it's settled. Hermes will relax and Zoidberg will eat! Hurrah!
2,13,11,MORGAN,"I've been reviewing your corporate records. Regarding last Monday's delivery, why did it take twice as long as scheduled?"
2,13,11,LEELA,Fry got his head stuck in a crater.
2,13,11,FRY (ASHAMED),I thought it would fit.
2,13,11,MORGAN,"And during this period of head-crater interaction, what were you doing?"
2,13,11,BENDER,Martini drinking contests with the autopilot. I would've had him this time but we ran out of olives.
2,13,11,LEELA,I can explain.
2,13,11,MORGAN,You really think you can explain how you left port without a full compliment of olives? I think not.
2,13,11,LEELA (QUIETLY),"What is this, high school?"
2,13,11,MORGAN,Locker check!
2,13,11,MORGAN,Why isn't this jacket in alphabetical order?
2,13,11,LEELA,What?
2,13,11,MORGAN,The zipper. It should be at the bottom.
2,13,11,BENDER (ASHAMED),"Hey, sometimes a guy gets lonely."
2,13,11,MORGAN,I - I've never seen anything like this. Why is there yoghurt in this cap?
2,13,11,FRY,"Uh, I can explain that. See, it used to be milk and, well, time makes fools of us all."
2,13,11,MORGAN,"You are all dismissed. Fry, I will speak to you alone."
2,13,11,FRY,"Uh wait, this is the other Fry's locker. I'm Phry with a ""Ph."""
2,13,11,FRY,What the hell's going on? I thought you were anti-dirty not pro-dirty.
2,13,11,MORGAN,I'm surrounded by neat freaks everyday. There's nothing kinkier to me than a filthy slop-jock like you!
2,13,11,FRY (BASHFUL),Oh stop!
2,13,11,MORGAN,Now listen you filthy pig. No-one can know about us. If anyone asks I'll deny it.
2,13,11,FRY,Just like very other girl I've dated.
2,13,11,HERMES,"Curse that Dr Zoidberg! If I get out of here, he'll be looking down the business end of a shrimp fork!"
2,13,11,AUSTRALIAN GUY,Give him one for me too mate. I don't know why I go to him.
2,13,11,MORGAN,"...and for those six and a half reasons, I am demoting Leela to co-pilot."
2,13,11,LEELA,Co-pilot? Under who?
2,13,11,MORGAN,The autopilot.
2,13,11,LEELA,That drunk?!
2,13,11,MORGAN,Mr Bender you are now in charge of co-ordinating the Professor's bodily functions.
2,13,11,FARNSWORTH,That's a full time job.
2,13,11,MORGAN,"And Fry, as for you, I am promoting you to executive delivery boy. You will no longer go on deliveries and you will have your own office next to mine."
2,13,11,FRY,All right!
2,13,11,MORGAN,Mr Bender would you high five him so we can continue this meeting? And on the rebound? Meeting adjourned.
2,13,11,AMY,I can't figure why she's so nice to you Fry.
2,13,11,ZOIDBERG,She's a hateful monster this Morgan. She scolded and hit me. I tell you she's risking my friendship with her.
2,13,11,LEELA,"Bender, what happened to you?"
2,13,11,BENDER,"Morgan made me walk the Professor. There we were in the park when suddenly some old lady says I stole her purse. I chucked the Professor at her but she kept on coming. So had to hit her with this purse I found. Ah, the point is it's Morgan's fault. That pencil pushing scazwag. Why if she were here I'd - Uh oh is she behind me?"
2,13,11,MORGAN,No. I'm in front of you!
2,13,11,FRY,Morgan? It's 3am.
2,13,12,MORGAN,"I know. A skunk knocked over my garbage and suddenly all I could think of was you. My God, it's so...repulsive. So uh, this is where you eat?"
2,13,12,FRY,Eat and sleep.
2,13,12,MORGAN,Oh Fry!
2,13,12,FRY,"Uh wait, Bender's my rooommate. He could be back any second."
2,13,12,MORGAN,Not likely. I ordered him to flush out the Professor's earwax.
2,13,14,BENDER,"Hey Fry, I made you a candle with - What the? Oh now I see! Now I get it. Now the pieces are falling into place. The office, the promotion, that dwarf in my book club who steals my opinions. It's all coming together now!"
2,13,14,BENDER,I must say this opens my eyes! Another case closed my dear Watson.
2,13,14,FRY,"Morgan, come back! He's stuck in a loop!"
2,13,14,BENDER,For I was blind but now I see!
2,13,14,BENDER [FROM INSIDE],The cat's out of the bag now!
2,13,15,MORGAN,Mr Bender about last night. that was just a...a misunderstanding.
2,13,15,BENDER,Oh you didn't understand? Well let me explain. You......were having sex with you.
2,13,15,MORGAN,"No. You see, a bureaucrat of my rank isn't supposed to fraternize."
2,13,15,BENDER,"That's what makes it so juicy. Its the forbidden fruit angle everybody loves. First I'll say ""You'll never guess who saw Fry and Morgan doing it!"" and they'll say ""Who Bender, who?"" and I'll say ""It was lovable......old Bender."""
2,13,15,FRY,"Hey, what did you do to him?"
2,13,15,MORGAN,"I downloaded his brain. Everything that is Bender is right here. His mind, his memories, his in-your-face interface."
2,13,15,FRY,"But, but...Bender need brain...for...smart making! What did you do now? Stop doing things!"
2,13,15,MORGAN,I sent the disk to be filed at the Central Bureaucracy. I did what I had to do Fry. He was a bad robot.
2,13,15,FRY,"No, he was a bad friend. I want him back right now."
2,13,15,MORGAN,Then you should have filed a request 20 years ago.
2,13,15,FRY,I'm sick of you and your bureaucracy.
2,13,15,MORGAN,Dirty boy! Dirty boy!
2,13,15,LEELA,You and Morgan were having an affair?
2,13,15,FRY,I couldn't help it. She loved me because of the part of me that's a slob and I loved her because of the part of me that's desperate.
2,13,15,FRY,Poor Bender. Without his brain he's become all quiet and helpful. We've got to go to the Central Bureaucracy and get that disk back!
2,13,15,AMY,Yeah!
2,13,15,FARNSWORTH,"Oh yes we must, yes."
2,13,15,AMY,Why?
2,13,15,LEELA,"Well, those arguments aside, we're still going."
2,13,15,FARNSWORTH,You can't just waltz into the Central Bureaucracy. It's a tangled web of red tape and regulations. I've never been but a friend of mine went completely mad trying to find the washroom there.
2,13,15,LEELA,Then we'll need a guide. Someone who's been there before.
2,13,15,FARNSWORTH,Oh I've been there. Lot's of times!
2,13,15,HERMES,Look at that. The carts go out full but they come in empty. It's criminally inefficient.
2,13,15,HERMES,But don't you see? They could increase efficiency 4% if they used the empty carts to haul in heavy mining machinery.
2,13,15,AUSTRALIAN GUY,Oh Lord!
2,13,15,FRY,"Man, how long is this gonna take?"
2,13,15,OLD MAN,I'm still waiting on my birth certificate.
2,13,15,FARNSWORTH,Well it doesn't look like I'll make it inside with the rest of you. Uh but good luck. Just leave me where I drop.
2,13,15,OLD MAN,"Oh great, someone had a baby!"
2,13,15,LEELA,"Come on, I have a better idea."
2,13,15,LEELA,Excuse me? We're from the Planet Express delivery company. We're here to deliver a robot.
2,13,15,GRADE 53,Looks like we've got a new office cut up!
2,13,16,GRADE 41,"Look out, look out! I'm going to crash my slow-mobile! I had to swerve to avoid you."
2,13,16,LEELA,"While you're crashing, could you tell us where all these canisters end up?"
2,13,16,GRADE 41,Oh you want Central Filing.
2,13,16,OK.,
2,13,16,OK.,
2,13,16,AMY,
2,13,16,FARNSWORTH,Wonderful.
2,13,16,GRADE 41 (SCREAMING),Nooo!
2,13,16,GRADE 20,Central Filing? Of course I know where that is. I'm a grade 20.
2,13,16,LEELA,Where is it?
2,13,16,GRADE 20,I can't tell you. What do I look like? A grade 16?
2,13,16,LEELA,"We're getting nowhere slowly. Here, I'll address this to the Central Filing room. Then we'll track it using my wrist-lojack-amater."
2,13,16,WRIST THING,Cold. Cold. Warmer. Hot hot hot hot hot hot.
2,13,16,GRADE 11,Please don't tell my supervisor I was sleeping.
2,13,16,LEELA,"This is it. We'll just run in, grab Bender's disk and run out. Got it?"
2,13,17,FRY,We'll never find that disk will we Bender?
2,13,17,FRY,You're right. Nothing is over so long as there's one thin ray of hope.
2,13,17,MORGAN,Lost something? I should have known you'd come here rather than follow proper procedure. And I did know. And that's why I came here.
2,13,17,FRY,"Listen Morgan, We're through, you're an evil heartless woman and I never wanna see you again. However would you help us get Bender back for old times sake?"
2,13,17,MORGAN,I'm afraid he's lost in the master in pile. And it would take some sort of giant mechanical atomic powered sorting machine to find him.
2,13,17,HERMES,You rang?
2,13,17,FARNSWORTH,"Dammit Hermes, just jump already. Stop hogging that healthy liver."
2,13,17,HERMES,"No, I want to live. Organising that forced labour spa rekindled my lifelong love of bureaucracy."
2,13,17,LABARBARA,My Hermes got that hellhole running so efficiently that all the physical labour is now done by a single Australian man.
2,13,17,LEELA,But how did you know we were here?
2,13,17,HERMES,Dr Zoidberg brought us.
2,13,17,ZOIDBERG,"It was me, I'm the hero!"
2,13,17,NUMBER 1.0,Request for explanantion of incident meeting?
2,13,17,MORGAN,Number 1.0.
2,13,17,HERMES,"Number 1.0, I hereby petition you for an emergency sort-and-file, under regulation 2 point -"
2,13,17,NUMBER 1.0,Don't quote me regulations. I co-chaired the committee that reviewed the recommendation to revise the colour of the book that regulation's in. We kept it grey.
2,13,17,HERMES,"Sir please, I must located the disk with my friend's brain on it."
2,13,17,NUMBER 1.0,Very well. But your bureaucratic licence will be revoked if you fail to sort the master in pile by closing time. 1pm.
2,13,17,LEELA,That's only four minutes from now.
2,13,17,HERMES,Requisition me a beat.
2,13,17,,When I was born there was a hurricane in Kingston Town
2,13,17,,"With a foot and a half of water. Everyone was alright but I cried all night It blew my alphabet blocks out of order. And they said ""This boy's born to be a bureaucrat, Born to be all obsessive and snotty."" I made my friends and relations file long applications To get into my 10th birthday party."
2,13,17,LABARBARA (SINGING),But something changed when my man turn pro.
2,13,17,HERMES (SINGING),I was sortin' but I wasn't smilin'.
2,13,17,LABARBARA (SINGING),He forgot that it's not about badges and ranks.
2,13,17,HERMES (SINGING),It's supposed to be about the filing! People!
2,13,17,,"We didn't choose to be bureaucrats, No that's what almighty Jah made us! We treat people like swine, And make 'em stand in line, Even if nobody paid us!"
2,13,17,ZOIDBERG (SINGING),They said I probably shouldn't be a surgeon.
2,13,17,FARNSWORTH (SINGING),They poo-pooed my electric frankfurter.
2,13,17,LEELA (SINGING),They said I probably shouldn't fly with just one eye.
2,13,17,HERMES (SINGING),Everybody sing Jamaica!
2,13,17,EVERYBODY (SINGING),Jamaica!
2,13,17,HERMES,"Just the bureaucrats, Jamaica!"
2,13,17,BUREACRATS (SINGING),Jamaica!
2,13,17,HERMES (SINGING),The grade 19s!
2,13,17,MORGAN,Jamaica.
2,13,17,HERMES (SINGING),"Sing me home! When push comes to shove, You gotta do what you love, Even if it's not a good idea!"
2,13,17,BENDER,"I'm Bender baby, please insert liquor!"
2,13,17,FRY,Yeah!
2,13,17,HERMES,Congratulations.
2,13,17,NUMBER 1.0,Congratulations indeed but you finshed with one second to spare so I'm demoting you. A good bureaucrat never finishes early.
2,13,17,AMY,That's OK Hermes. At least we have you back.
2,13,17,MORGAN,"Not yet you don't. I'm still acting bureaucrat of Planet Express. And I have some changes to make. First, Fry, you're fired. Second -"
2,13,17,HERMES,Not so fast! When I was sortin' I came upon a certain document filed by one Morgan Proctor. Form B: Notification Of Romantic Entanglement.
2,13,17,FRY,"That's right, she fraternized me!"
2,13,17,MORGAN,That form isn't about you. It refers to my high school prom date. It was a regulation date that ended in regulation disappointment.
2,13,17,HERMES,Yes but you only stamped it four times!
2,13,17,MORGAN,No! No! I was young and reckless.
2,13,17,NUMBER 1.0,Bureaucrat Conrad you are technically correct - the best kind of correct. I hereby promote you to grade 37. And as for you. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!
2,13,17,FARNSWORTH,"Well, it looks like I'll be needing my heroic bureaucrat back. At severely reduced pay of course."
2,13,17,LABARBARA,It's better than nothing!
2,13,17,FRY,What about me? Can I come back at severely reduced pay?
2,13,17,HERMES,"You got it mon! In fact, severely reduced pay all around! Come on wife, let's blow this joint!"
2,13,17,ZOIDBERG,Now it's time for my song! When I was two there was a tidal wave in -
