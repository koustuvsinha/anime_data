2,14,0,"""A CLONE OF MY OWN""","By Patric M. Verrone Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
2,14,0,FARNSWORTH,"Good news everyone, the university is bringing me up on disciplinary charges! Wait, that's not good news at all."
2,14,0,LEELA,"Whatever you did Professor, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation."
2,14,0,FARNSWORTH,"Yes but they won't listen. Everyone's always in favour of saving Hitler's brain but when you put it in the body of a great white shark ooo, suddenly you've gone too far."
2,14,0,,[The ship flies towards Mars and cruises over the Mars University sign.
2,14,1,VERNON,"Professor Farnsworth, do you know why we've called you here today?"
2,14,1,FARNSWORTH,"Listen to me you pompous frauds, if I'm going down, I'm taking you all with me. Dean Vernon, I know the truth. It was you driving your hover-car that night, not your horse. Dean Epsilon, I know all about your ""Department Of Pool Boy Studies."" And Dr Wernstrom...Werrrnstrom!"
2,14,1,VERNON,"Actually Professor, we merely called you here to say......surprise."
2,14,1,MAN #1,Surprise!
2,14,1,MAN #2,Happy birthday!
2,14,1,HERMES,Surprise!
2,14,1,FARNSWORTH,"And you Coach Smalley, or should I say ""Coach hairpiece""?"
2,14,1,LEELA,"No Professor, it's a surprise party for your 150th birthday."
2,14,1,FARNSWORTH,Hundred and...what? Oooh!
2,14,1,BENDER,"Good evening I'm - Whoa, sorry. I'm Bender and I'll be MC-ing this roast. Y'know, they say you can judge a man by the company he keeps, so here's the Professor's oldest friend: A grotesque, stinking lobster!"
2,14,1,ZOIDBERG,"Good evening ladies and germs. That wasn't a joke, I was talking to Dean Streptococcus. Now I'm not saying Professor Farnsworth is old, but if you consider his age he's likely to die soon! Hey Ringo, that was the joke. Oh, it's showtime at the Apollo all over again."
2,14,1,BENDER,"Where would the Professor be without students who love and respect him? Right there! But seriously, of all the former crew members of the Professor's delivery ship, our next speaker is by far the most alive. Captain Muskie?"
2,14,1,ZOIDBERG,I wouldn't wanna follow that guy!
2,14,1,BENDER,"And now, a man who needs no introduction. Fry, get up there!"
2,14,1,FRY,"Oh. Thank you. Y'know, when I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Professor Farnsworth, I thought ""Why should I?"" Then later Leela made the film. But if I had made the film, you could bet there would have been a lot more topless women on motorcycles! Roll film!"
2,14,1,FRY,Dork alert!
2,14,1,BENDER,How 'bout a few words Professor?
2,14,1,FARNSWORTH,Eh wha?
2,14,1,BENDER,"I said ""words."""
2,14,1,FARNSWORTH,"Uh, what a pleasure it is to see my lifetime of accomplishments summed up in a 3-minute film. My best years are behind me. So much left undone. So little time."
2,14,1,BENDER,Funny funny stuff.
2,14,1,FARNSWORTH,My life is over.
2,14,1,LEELA,No it isn't. You have another 10 years left.
2,14,1,FRY,Leela! He could live another 100 years!
2,14,1,LEELA,"No, he couldn't. When you turn 160, robots from the Sunset Squad take you to a mysterious planet and you never return."
2,14,1,FRY,"Wow, a whole planet of old people. Where is it?"
2,14,1,BENDER,Nobody knows!
2,14,1,FARNSWORTH,So many loves half-loved. So many inventions half-invented. That damn time machine alone set me back 15 years.
2,14,1,ZOIDBERG,If only it'd worked. You could go back and not waste your time on it.
2,14,1,FARNSWORTH,"There's no one to carry on after I'm gone. No one to take care of my work and my research and my fabulous fortune. By God, that's it! I've got to name a successor."
2,14,1,FRY,A successor?
2,14,1,ZOIDBERG,A successor to the Professor?
2,14,1,FARNSWORTH,There's no time to lose. I'm off to my lab to build a successor-naming machine!
2,14,1,FRY,"Man, the Professor's been in his lab for days."
2,14,1,BENDER,I hope he didn't die. Unless he left a note naming me his successor. Then I hope he did die.
2,14,1,ZOIDBERG,You? The successor? Over my empty shell! The Professor will pick me. Only I have his lobster-like tenacity!
2,14,1,HERMES,Up yours Zoidberg. Up wherever your species traditionally crams things. The only successful way to choose a successor is with a limbo contest.
2,14,1,LEELA,What?
2,14,1,HERMES,"Kingston rules. Two men go down, one come up."
2,14,2,LEELA,"Look, the Professor trusts me with a giant spaceship. He wouldn't trust the rest of you with his dentures."
2,14,3,AMY,Yesh he would.
2,14,3,FRY,Sorry everyone but need I remind you? Blood is thicker than water.
2,14,3,ZOIDBERG [WRITING],Blood...thicker...water.
2,14,4,FARNSWORTH,"Everyone, I have a very dramatic announcement. So anyone with a weak heart should leave now. Goodbye."
2,14,4,LEELA,"Uh, Professor?"
2,14,4,FARNSWORTH,"Oh yes, the announcement! As you all know, I am not long for this world..."
2,14,4,LEELA,"Yes, we know."
2,14,4,HERMES,True mon!
2,14,4,AMY,Buh!
2,14,4,FRY,One foot in the grave.
2,14,4,FARNSWORTH,...So I've picked my successor. It's someone in whom I have great faith - even though his mind is undeveloped and he's accomplished nothing. My closest living relative...
2,14,4,FRY,Oh yeah!
2,14,4,FARNSWORTH,"My clone, Cubert Farnsworth."
2,14,4,ZOIDBERG,He's horrible!
2,14,4,FRY,Crud. Can I at least be in charge of your dentures?
2,14,4,AMY,You wish!
2,14,4,FRY,Where did Cubert come from?
2,14,4,FARNSWORTH,12 years ago I began the cloning process by removing some skin cells from one of the shaplier growths on my back.
2,14,4,LEELA,"Wait, if he's your clone then why doesn't his nose look like yours?"
2,14,4,FARNSWORTH,I left him in his first tube too long and he got squished up against the side.
2,14,4,BENDER,Is he dumb or just ugly?
2,14,4,FARNSWORTH,Let's find out.
2,14,4,CUBERT,What? You've never seen a genius's wiener before?
2,14,4,ZOIDBERG,No.
2,14,4,LEELA,Never.
2,14,4,FRY,"Well, once in the park."
2,14,4,ZOIDBERG,Mmm!
2,14,4,CUBERT,"As long as I'm going to be in charge here, let me examine my so called ""crew,"" if it can so be called. First of all, Dr Zoidberg, do you even have a medical degree?"
2,14,4,ZOIDBERG,I lost it...in a volcano.
2,14,4,CUBERT,And why do we need a bending robot around here anyway? What possible use do we have for you?
2,14,4,BENDER,Uh...me no speaka the English.
2,14,4,CUBERT,And why does our space pilot have only one eye? There's someone I'd like you to meet. His name is depth perception!
2,14,4,LEELA,Why you little -!
2,14,4,CUBERT,"Wow, that hurt - the air!"
2,14,4,BENDER,Im pending para un bending!
2,14,4,FARNSWORTH,"Oh Cubert, come in here. I have something amazing to show you."
2,14,4,CUBERT,What is it? A compitent employee? I doubt that very much!
2,14,4,FRY,Little twerp.
2,14,4,BENDER,Aye chihuahua!
2,14,4,FARNSWORTH,As my successor I'm trusting you to carry on my work. These are just some of the half finished inventions you'll spend your life finishing.
2,14,4,CUBERT,I didn't realise you were the inventor of the junk heap.
2,14,4,FARNSWORTH,"That's my prizewinning smelloscope. If a dog craps anywhere in the universe, you can bet I won't be out of the loop. And this is my universal translator. Unfortunately so far it only translates into an incomprehensible dead language."
2,14,4,CUBERT,Hello.
2,14,4,UNIVERSAL TRANSLATOR,Bonjour!
2,14,4,FARNSWORTH,Crazy gibberish!
2,14,4,CUBERT,Don't you have any worthwhile inventions?
2,14,4,FARNSWORTH,Why certainly. Step over here.
2,14,4,FARNSWORTH,These are the dark matter engine I invented. They allow my starship to travel between galaxies in mere hours.
2,14,4,CUBERT,That's impossible. You can't go faster than the speed of light.
2,14,4,FARNSWORTH,Of course not. That's why scientists increased the speed of light in 2208.
2,14,4,CUBERT,Also impossible.
2,14,4,FARNSWORTH,And what makes my engines truly remarkable is the afterburner which delivers 200% fuel efficiency.
2,14,4,CUBERT,That's especially impossible.
2,14,4,FARNSWORTH,Not at all. It's very simple.
2,14,4,CUBERT,Then explain it.
2,14,4,FARNSWORTH,Now that's impossible. It came to me in a dream and I forgot it in another dream.
2,14,4,CUBERT,Your explainations are pure weapons grade balognium. It's all impossible.
2,14,4,FARNSWORTH,Nothing is impossible. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being is a scientist is all about.
2,14,4,CUBERT,"No, that's what being a magical elf is all about."
2,14,4,BENDER,"Oh my God, oh my God! It's Elzar, the TV chef! Oh kill me now people!"
2,14,4,ELZAR,How we doing here?
2,14,4,BENDER,"Oh Elzar, everything's so good!"
2,14,4,ELZAR,"What are you, an ass kissing machine?"
2,14,4,BENDER,"Yes sir, good one sir!"
2,14,4,FARNSWORTH,Oh it's a gem of an evening! I feel so wonderful having someone to take over my life work! And it's all thanks to Cubert.
2,14,4,CUBERT,Look Professor. I may be identical to you in every possible way but that doesn't mean I'm anything like you.
2,14,4,FARNSWORTH,You...wha?
2,14,4,CUBERT,I don't want to be an inventor. I want to be something useful like a teacher's aide or a prison guard or a science fiction cartoon writer.
2,14,4,FARNSWORTH,But-But what about my hopes and my dreams and my wonderful inventions?
2,14,4,CUBERT,In your entire life your only half-decent invention was me and I didn't turn out like you wanted either.
2,14,4,ELZAR,You folks still doing alright?
2,14,4,BENDER,Oh yes Elzar.
2,14,4,ELZAR,Good 'cause it turns out I forgot to cook that chicken.
2,14,4,FARNSWORTH,"Bad news everyone. By the time you watch this tape, I'll be gone. Leaving by nothing but a history of failure and my original hipbones. You see, I've been lying about my age. I'm not actually 150. I'm 160. Oh vanity, thy name is Professor Farnsworth. And now that I've nothing to live for, I've alerted the Sunset Squad robots to take me away."
2,14,6,FARNSWORTH,"Goodbye cruel world. Goodbye cruel lamp. Goodbye cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin......and the cute little pompom curtain pull cords, cruel though they may be a -"
2,14,6,HOLO-FARNSWORTH,"And now that I've nothing to live for, I've alerted the Sunset Squad robots to take me away."
2,14,6,AMY,What?
2,14,6,HERMES,Oh no!
2,14,6,ZOIDBERG,Oh.
2,14,6,HOLO-FARNSWORTH,"I know you're all very upset, especially Bender."
2,14,6,BENDER,"Well, life goes on. Except for you!"
2,14,6,HOLO-FARNSWORTH,I'm sure that Bender has just made a cutting remark but he doesn't know I taped over his soap operas to record this message.
2,14,6,BENDER,You bastard!
2,14,6,FRY,We've gotta get him back.
2,14,6,CUBERT,Impossible. No one knows where they take those old geezers.
2,14,6,FRY,"Nothing is impossible. You'd know that if you really took after the Professor, like I do."
2,14,6,CUBERT,"You're his uncle dummy, he takes after you."
2,14,6,FRY,Uh...what?
2,14,6,CUBERT,"Wait a second, that means I also take after you!"
2,14,6,LEELA,Quiet. I think I know how to find the Professor.
2,14,6,BENDER,Lay it on us big boots.
2,14,7,LEELA,"If the smelloscope can pick up the Professor's odour, we may have a chance to save him."
2,14,7,CUBERT,"I think not. As you probably already don't know, odours are made up of particles that can't travel through the vacuum of space."
2,14,7,LEELA,I'm zeroing in on him. Bengay...mothballs......letters to the editor. It's the Professor!
2,14,7,BENDER,To the flying machine!
2,14,8,FRY,"To the left! No to the up! U-turn, U-turn!"
2,14,8,CUBERT,We'll never find this place. Robots are very good at keeping secrets.
2,14,8,BENDER,No we're not you little bed wetter. Oops I'm sorry.
2,14,8,LEELA,There it is! The Near-Death Star!
2,14,9,LEELA,
2,14,9,FRY,I'm on it!
2,14,9,CUBERT,"My God, the illusion is so perfect I almost forgot I was looking at an idiot!"
2,14,9,LEELA,Now they may ask for a DNA sample.
2,14,9,FRY,I'd like to see them find it!
2,14,9,CUBERT,"This is impossible, we don't even hae a sample of the Professor's DNA."
2,14,9,BENDER,I think I know where to get some.
2,14,10,CUBERT,Why do I have to be the hump?
2,14,10,FRY,'Cause you're too ugly to be a wart.
2,14,10,LEELA,Your medicare dollars at work.
2,14,10,BARRIERBOT #1,Halt! Identify this guest.
2,14,10,LEELA,"Uh, this is Professor Hubert Farnsworth. He escaped."
2,14,10,BARRIERBOT #1,Escaped? No one escapes.
2,14,10,BARRIERBOT #2,This guest does not look 160.
2,14,10,FRY,"What? I'm old. Listen. Hey you kids, get off the lawn!"
2,14,10,BARRIERBOT #1,"Hmm, it is true that old people are often concerned that there are children on their lawns."
2,14,10,BARRIERBOT #2,There's no denying that. But we'll still need to verify his identidity with a DNA sample.
2,14,10,BENDER,Got a hot steaming batch right here!
2,14,10,BARRIERBOT #2,We only need one cell!
2,14,10,BENDER,"Eh, keep the change buddy."
2,14,10,CUBERT,Stupid robot.
2,14,10,BARRIERBOT #1,Did you hump just say something?
2,14,10,FRY,Uh....I-I've got talking hump syndrome.
2,14,10,BARRIERBOT #1,"Ah, THS."
2,14,10,BARRIERBOT #2,Identity confirmed. Return this shambling shuffleboarder to his room.
2,14,10,BARRIERBOT #1,7152 Maple Drive.
2,14,10,LEELA,Sounds nice.
2,14,10,BARRIERBOT #1,Prepare to be surprised.
2,14,10,FRY,So this is where they stick old people. It's horrific.
2,14,10,LEELA,At least it keeps them from driving.
2,14,10,LEELA,Brace yourself for the worst.
2,14,10,BENDER,And yet he looks so natural.
2,14,10,CUBERT,What's happening?
2,14,10,LEELA,"He's hooked up to a life-support system. We have to disconnect him very very carefully, or the shock could kill him."
2,14,10,GUARDBOT #1,Freeze! Seize them!
2,14,10,GUARDBOT #2,Seize them!
2,14,10,GUARDBOT #3,Seize them!
2,14,10,GUARDBOT #4,Seize them!
2,14,10,GUARDBOT #1,Get them - I mean seize them!
2,14,10,GUARDBOT #2,Aww I'm so bad at this!
2,14,10,GUARDBOT #3,Uh-oh!
2,14,11,LEELA,"We're probably going to make it, but we might not."
2,14,11,CUBERT,"It's impossible, we'll never fit."
2,14,11,FRY,Will too.
2,14,12,CUBERT,Told you.
2,14,12,FRY,"Come on Leela, step your big boot down on the gas pedal."
2,14,14,LEELA,They've blown out one of our engines!
2,14,14,FRY,Fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it! Fix it fix it fix it!
2,14,14,LEELA,Only the Professor knows how to fix it. We have to wake him up.
2,14,14,FRY,Try shocking him.
2,14,14,BENDER,Your social security cheque is late! Stuff costs more than it used to. Young people use curse words!
2,14,14,FRY,"Damnit, we'll have to fix the engine ourself."
2,14,14,LEELA,"We can't you bastard, no one knows how it works. It's impossible."
2,14,14,CUBERT,Nothing is impossible. I understand how the engines work now. It came to me in a dream. The engines don't move the ship at all. The ship stays where it is and the engines move the universe around it.
2,14,14,BENDER,That's a complete load.
2,14,14,CUBERT,Nothing's a complete load. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being a scientist is all about. Right Professor?
2,14,14,FARNSWORTH,Eh...whuh...
2,14,14,CUBERT,Let's ride!
2,14,15,CUBERT,"Good news everyone, he's made a complete recovery."
2,14,15,AMY,Yeah!
2,14,15,HERMES,Wow!
2,14,15,LEELA,All right!
2,14,15,FARNSWORTH,I'm as spry as a 140 year old. See? I only broke one ankle.
2,14,15,FRY,So what were they doing to you in that awful drawer?
2,14,15,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, they had me hooked up to a bizarre virtual world that seemed absolutely real."
2,14,15,AMY,What was it like?
2,14,15,FARNSWORTH,"It was as though I was living in a facility in Florida with hundreds of other old people. All day long we'd play bingo, eat oatmeal and wait for our children to call."
2,14,15,LEELA,It's a hundred times more horrible than anything I could imagine.
2,14,15,FARNSWORTH,"Oh my yes. Thank you all for saving me. Especially you my little clone. No matter what you decide to do with your life, I'm still proud of you."
2,14,15,CUBERT,"I've already decided. Dad, when I grow up I wanna be just like you."
2,14,15,FARNSWORTH,"Don't worry son. You will. Incidentally, you might want to read up on a condition known as ""wandering bladder."""
2,14,15,CUBERT,Why?
2,14,15,FARNSWORTH,No reason. No reason at all.
