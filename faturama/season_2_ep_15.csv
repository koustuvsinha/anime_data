2,15,0,"""THE DEEP SOUTH""","By J. Stewart Burns Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
2,15,0,HERMES,"Exciting news, people! The pet licence I requsitioned for Nibbler has arrived."
2,15,0,LEELA,"Hermes, that's sweet. I didn't know you cared about Nibbler."
2,15,0,HERMES,"Dream on, woman. I'd like to put the little bastard in a sack and toss the sack in a river and hurl the river into space. But I do like filling out requisitions and these were some doozies! Great Jah's dreadlocks! There's been a mix-up. This isn't a pet licence, it's a fishing licence. And it's mandatory!"
2,15,0,FARNSWORTH,Ah! The exact centre of the Atlantic Ocean. This seems the logical place for fish to congregate.
2,15,0,BENDER,So we're in international waters?
2,15,0,FARNSWORTH,Indeed so.
2,15,0,BENDER,"Falcon, this is Blue Raven, the goose has nested. Repeat, the goose has nested. Hey, guess what you're accessories to?"
2,15,0,LEELA,"The sun, the sea air, good friends."
2,15,0,BENDER,"Leela's right, fishing blows. Whattya say we make it interesting?"
2,15,0,HERMES,Why not?
2,15,0,AMY,Yeah.
2,15,0,FARNSWORTH,"Yeah, cool."
2,15,0,BENDER,"Everybody kick in five bucks. There, wasn't that interesting?"
2,15,0,LEELA,Bender!
2,15,0,FRY,This contest is as good as over. I once caught a fish this big.
2,15,0,BENDER,"Oh, yeah? I once caught a fish this big!"
2,15,0,LEELA,"I'm afraid you're both out of your league, boys, 'cause you're looking at a woman who owns her own harpoon."
2,15,0,BENDER,"Harpoon, my ass!"
2,15,0,OK.,
2,15,0,HERMES,"Let's see now, which bait to use? Crickets? Squid? Chicken necks?"
2,15,0,ZOIDBERG,"Excuse me, if I might be so bold, I'm willing to offer my services as a bait critic. These sardines for example are bland and tasteless. And these dry, stringy nightcrawlers, though juicy ... ... very very juicy--"
2,15,0,HERMES,"I don't believe this! It's eating my bait! Beat it, you mooching crawdad!"
2,15,0,BENDER,"Hey, Fry, check out my laser-guided fishing rod."
2,15,0,FRY,"Quiet, Bender, you're scaring away the fish."
2,15,0,BENDER,Fine. I'll head over to the other side. Good luck fishing on this side!
2,15,0,FRY,I can hit a fish between the eyes from 20 yards!
2,15,0,BENDER,"Oh, yeah? I can hit a shrimp!"
2,15,0,FRY,A shrimp? I find it a bit hard to believe that--
2,15,0,LEELA,"Aha! Gather round, chumps! I got the winner!"
2,15,0,AMY,"Oh, so this is where you shop for your boots?"
2,15,0,BENDER,Couple more of those and you'll have yourself a fish stick!
2,15,0,FRY,"Hey, a fish this fine belongs in a fish nugget-style chunklet. And anyway, it's bigger than anything you've caught. Ow! My small intestine!"
2,15,0,LEELA,"Bingo! Whatever it is, it's 20 times heavier than a boot."
2,15,0,FARNSWORTH,You'll never catch anything with that primitive technology. What you need is this fish pheromone. The most potent aphrodisiac known to fishkind. Uh-oh!
2,15,0,ZOIDBERG,I'm so into you!
2,15,0,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, my!"
2,15,0,FRY,"Hey, Bender, I just caught a fish this big!"
2,15,0,BENDER,"Quit exaggerating, Fry. Ah, screw this! If I'm not gonna catch a fish, I might as well not catch a big fish. There. Like most of life's problems this one can be solved with bending."
2,15,0,FARNSWORTH,"Bender, be careful. That's the ships diamond filament tether. It's unbreakable."
2,15,0,BENDER,Then why do I have to be careful?
2,15,0,FARNSWORTH,It belonged to my grandmother.
2,15,0,HERMES,My manwich!
2,15,0,LEELA,"Wake up, everyone! I've got something. And this time it's alive! Dr. Zoidberg, since when do you even wear boots?"
2,15,0,ZOIDBERG,I wasn't wearing it. I was eating it.
2,15,0,LEELA,"Come on, let's go home."
2,15,0,AMY,Sunburn! My fabulous body! It's ruined! What happened to my parasol?
2,15,0,BENDER,I don't know. It wasn't here when I took your umbrella. What? I put sunblock on you.
2,15,0,AMY,Well it didn't work!
2,15,0,LEELA,"Come on, Bender. Pull in your line and let's go."
2,15,0,BENDER,"Hey, I'm snagged."
2,15,0,FARNSWORTH,"It's not snagged, the mechano man has caught something! Sweet Zombie Jesus! It's huge!"
2,15,0,AMY,It's coming up!
2,15,0,HERMES,"Oh, that's big!"
2,15,0,FARNSWORTH,A colossal-mouth bass!
2,15,0,FRY,It's diving!
2,15,0,LEELA,It's pulling us under! Everyone into the ship!
2,15,0,ZOIDBERG,"Wait! I'll save us! By cutting the unbreakable diamond filament! Well, at least I'll die with my friends. Hello?"
2,15,0,HERMES,My Speedos!
2,15,0,LEELA,"Depth at 45 hundred feet, 48 hundred, 50 hundred! 5000 feet!"
2,15,0,FARNSWORTH,"Dear Lord, that's over 150 atmospheres of pressure."
2,15,0,FRY,How many atmospheres can this ship withstand?
2,15,0,FARNSWORTH,"Well it's a spaceship, so I'd say anywhere between zero and one."
2,15,0,BENDER,What's that? Is someone bending girders?
2,15,0,LEELA,We'll be crushed if we don't equalise the pressure.
2,15,0,FRY,How do we do that?
2,15,0,FARNSWORTH,That should do it.
2,15,0,AMY,We're all gonna die!
2,15,0,FRY,"Wait, I'll be back in a minute."
2,15,0,LEELA,"You did it, Fry!"
2,15,0,FRY,Did what?
2,15,0,BENDER,"People, it's far far worse than we thought; My fish got away."
2,15,0,LEELA,"There, good as new! Except we're three miles below the surface, we don't have any food and the ship won't work underwater."
2,15,0,BENDER,Tempers are wearing thin. Let's just hope some robot doesn't kill everybody.
2,15,0,HERMES,"The important thing is that we don't panic. There are rules for situations like this. Now, the first order of business is lunch. I suggest a nice lobster Zoidberg, I mean lobster Newburg, I mean Doctor Zoidberg."
2,15,0,LEELA,
2,15,0,FRY,I'd better go too. They don't know what I like.
2,15,0,HERMES,"Fry, no! The pressure will crush you like a green snake under a sugarcane truck."
2,15,0,FARNSWORTH,Not necessarily. This is chance for Fry to test out my experimental anti-pressure pill.
2,15,0,FRY,I can't swallow that.
2,15,0,FARNSWORTH,Well then good news! It's a suppository.
2,15,0,ZOIDBERG,"How are you doing there, Fry? Glad to hear it. Aha!"
2,15,0,BENDER,"Aw, yeah!"
2,15,0,ZOIDBERG,"Yum, yum, yum! Uh-oh! Look at me, I'm Dr. Zoidberg, homeowner!"
2,15,0,ZOIDBERG,"Careful, Fry, I think that flag might be poisonous."
2,15,0,BENDER,"Ahoy, mateys! I shanghaied us some hearty grub. Arr! The laws o' science be a harsh mistress!"
2,15,0,ZOIDBERG,"Say, robot, old buddy? Could you help me move a couch?"
2,15,0,BENDER,"Uh, OK, but I'm not carrying it upstairs."
2,15,0,ZOIDBERG,"What is it, Fry?"
2,15,0,FRY,Mermaid.
2,15,0,BENDER,You want some lemonade? You saw a big parade?
2,15,0,ZOIDBERG,"Your student loans have been repaid? Then how 'bout lending your old pal Zoidberg a few bucks, Mr Millionaire!"
2,15,0,LEELA,"Fry, swallow your food. Then talk."
2,15,0,FRY,A mermaid!
2,15,0,AMY,You think you saw a mermaid?
2,15,0,FRY,"No, I did see a mermaid! She was wearing a tube top and she had a beautiful scaley tail. And I think she had hair extensions."
2,15,0,BENDER,"Yeah, right!"
2,15,0,LEELA,Sure she did.
2,15,0,HERMES,
2,15,0,FARNSWORTH,"You're simply hallucinating, you ... moron."
2,15,0,FRY,"What's so far-fetched about mermaids? I mean, there's all sorts of weird sea creatures here in the future. Like Dr. Zoidberg."
2,15,0,LEELA,I'm afraid Fry is suffering from ocean madness.
2,15,0,FRY,"Every time something good happens to me you say it's some kind of madness, or I'm drunk, or I ate too much candy. Well I saw a real mermaid and I wish for once my friends would have decency and kindness to believe me."
2,15,0,LEELA,Ocean madness.
2,15,0,FARNSWORTH,He may have ocean madness but that's no excuse for ocean rudeness.
2,15,0,FRY,"Ocean madness, yeah right. It's always something, ain't it? It's her! Bender, wake up! She's here! Wake up! Oh! oxygen!"
2,15,1,MERMAID,"Here you go, darlin'."
2,15,1,FRY,"Hey! I can breath and talk, just like a fish!"
2,15,1,MERMAID,"Oh, you speak fish?"
2,15,1,FRY,What?
2,15,1,MERMAID,"I'm sorry, my accent's atrocious. Hi, my name's Umbriel!"
2,15,1,FRY,"I'm Fry. So, uh, am I gonna drown?"
2,15,1,UMBRIEL,Course not. Just stay calm and let the currents relax your every muscle.
2,15,1,FRY,"Aw, yeah!"
2,15,1,UMBRIEL,Did it just get warmer?
2,15,1,FRY,I can't believe you're really real. I like your tail.
2,15,1,UMBRIEL,"Oh, you're sweet. I like those wiggly doo-dads comin' outta your hips."
2,15,1,FRY,"Oh, Thanks. They're called pants."
2,15,1,UMBRIEL,This here's a volcanic vent. The water comes out at over 4000 degrees.
2,15,1,FRY,No kidding.
2,15,1,UMBRIEL,Did it just get colder? Tell me more about that bizarre land-y world you come from. Is there water there too?
2,15,1,FRY,"Sure, sometimes it falls from the sky."
2,15,1,UMBRIEL,Hm.
2,15,1,FRY,And sometimes it doesn't.
2,15,1,UMBRIEL,"Oh, Mr. Fry! You do go on!"
2,15,1,FRY,"You know what I like best about you, Umbriel? You find me fascinating even when I'm not claiming to be a jewel thief or a lion tamer."
2,15,1,UMBRIEL,Lions? There are sealions on the land?
2,15,1,FRY,Yup. We call them land-sealions ... I tame them!
2,15,1,FARNSWORTH,I'm almost finish reconfiguring the ships propulsion system. We can leave as soon as the paper-mâché is dry.
2,15,1,LEELA,Where's Fry?
2,15,1,BENDER,I didn't kill him. Professor?
2,15,1,FARNSWORTH,"No, I've been busy."
2,15,1,HERMES,He must've gone out looking for that mermaid. The poor demented honky.
2,15,1,LEELA,"It's ocean madness alright. Sailors call it aqua dementia, the deep down crazies, the wet willies, the screaming moist!"
2,15,2,FARNSWORTH,"We'll form a search party. Now, we'll need oxygen."
2,15,2,BENDER,"I got it covered. In the event of an emergency, my ass can be used as a floatation device."
2,15,2,FARNSWORTH,"Ooh, that reminds me: You've all taken your pressure pills, right?"
2,15,2,AMY,Yes! Stop asking!
2,15,2,ZOIDBERG,I've got his scent! Over here where the water gets warmer. This way!
2,15,2,BENDER,Bend me!
2,15,2,AMY,Dude! An ancient sunken city!
2,15,2,FARNSWORTH,Could it possibly be? Are the old legends true? It is! It's the fabled lost city of Atlanta!
2,15,2,MERMAN,"Howdy, y'all!"
2,15,2,COLONEL,"Welcome to Atlanta. Folks round these parts call me the Colonel. Here, have some breathers, courtesy of our Chamber of Commerce."
2,15,2,FARNSWORTH,"This is uncomfortable and humiliating. Now, if they could put it in the form of a suppository."
2,15,2,COLONEL,"Y'all enjoy your stay! Tourism's our main source of income round here so see the sights, spend some money. Please don't leave!"
2,15,2,BENDER,"Fry! Oh, I just knew you were still alive! I owe you 10 bucks, Hermes!"
2,15,2,FRY,"Hey, you guys, the most amazing thing happened. It's two-for-one Tuesday at Krispy Kreme! Plus there's mermaids."
2,15,2,COLONEL,"Nice out of town folks, I'd like you to meet my daughter, Umbriel. Umbriel, these are some Yankees."
2,15,2,AMY,"So, Fry, Atlanta was an American city in your time?"
2,15,2,FRY,I think it was just an airport. They had a place where you could buy nuts.
2,15,2,UMBRIEL,"No! Ancient Atlanta was more than just a Delta hub. It was a vibrant metropolis, the equal of Paris or New York."
2,15,2,FRY,"That's right, honey! Whatever you say."
2,15,2,UMBRIEL,"Look at these fabulous ruins. Turner Field, the Coca-Cola bottling plant, the, uh, the airport."
2,15,2,LEELA,"But tell us: How could a city with such a ... fabulous airport, end up underwater?"
2,15,2,COLONEL,"Ah, now that's a story that can only rightly be told in a Chamber of Commerce video narrated by folk-rock trubadour Donovan."
2,15,2,DONOVAN,"Atlanta was a city, landlocked, hundreds of miles from the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean,"
2,15,2,,Though gods they were -- and also Jane Fonda was there.
2,15,2,MERMAIDS,Hail Atlanta!
2,15,2,LEELA,The magician?
2,15,2,BENDER,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wouldn't it take millions of years to evolve into mermaids?"
2,15,2,UMBRIEL,"Normally, yes, but the caffine really sped things up. That stuff's wonderful."
2,15,2,COLONEL,"So when Umbriel first brought home this carpet bagger, I was again' it. But, damnit, if old legs here ain't grown on me!"
2,15,2,FRY,"Aw, shucks, Colonel."
2,15,2,HERMES,"Well, it's all very nice here but we should be going. I miss me wife and me oxygen."
2,15,2,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, we all miss our loved ones and gases. Come on, Fry."
2,15,2,FRY,Wait. I'm not going with you.
2,15,2,LEELA,"But, Fry, what about us? What about your life on the surface? You don't belong down here."
2,15,2,ZOIDBERG,"She's right, I mean sure they got the Braves but it's a third-rate symphony."
2,15,2,FARNSWORTH,"Fry, you half-mad, half-insane maniac, be reasonable. Don't you realise that if you stay at this depth your body will permanently adapt to the pressure?"
2,15,2,FRY,Realise it? I don't even understand it!
2,15,2,FARNSWORTH,It means you'll never be able to return to the surface.
2,15,2,FRY,I don't care. I'm staying. I've got everything I want right here.
2,15,2,FARNSWORTH,I'm bored! Let's go!
2,15,2,ZOIDBERG,"You know, Fry, I've got a little place just outside town. You could come visit, maybe?"
2,15,2,FRY,"Sorry, Zoidberg. I'm trying to join the country club."
2,15,2,BENDER,"Oh, Fry! I'll miss you!"
2,15,2,COLONEL,"Y'all come back now, y'hear?"
2,15,2,FARNSWORTH,"Let's go, damnit! Let's go!"
2,15,2,ZOIDBERG,"Well, I guess this is goodbye for me as well."
2,15,2,LEELA,Whatever.
2,15,2,AMY,Later.
2,15,2,FARNSWORTH,Bye.
2,15,3,ZOIDBERG,No! My home! It burned down! How did this happen?
2,15,3,HERMES,That's a very good question.
2,15,3,BENDER,So that's where I left my cigar.
2,15,3,HERMES,That just raises further questions!
2,15,3,FRY,"You know, Umbriel, these last 24 hours have been the happiest days of my life."
2,15,3,UMBRIEL,"Oh, Fry! I want you to make a mer-woman outta mer-me."
2,15,3,FRY,Mercy! I do believe I'm gettin' the vapours!
2,15,3,UMBRIEL,What the hell is that?
2,15,3,FRY,Yeah I'm a little confused too. How do I ... y'know ... with the tail and all?
2,15,3,UMBRIEL,"I'm not your first am I? I mean, I-I lay my eggs and leave and you release your fertiliser."
2,15,3,FRY,"Why couldn't she be the other type of mermaid, with the fish part on top and the lady part on the bottom?"
2,15,3,UMBRIEL,Now who's gonna escort me to the Debutante Ball?
2,15,3,COLONEL,Well what about that rich young dugong from Macon?
2,15,3,FARNSWORTH,There! The engine modifications are complete.
2,15,3,LEELA,Prepare for launch.
2,15,4,FRY,Wait! Wait for me! Don't leave me here!
2,15,4,POOPENMEYER,"And so, in honour of his record-breaking catch, I'm proud to award Bender this cheque for $1000."
2,15,4,LEELA,It's you!
2,15,4,BENDER,"Hey, buddy!"
2,15,4,HERMES,My manwich!
2,15,4,LEELA,"Fry, are you alright? What happened?"
2,15,4,AMY,What about Umbriel?
2,15,4,FRY,"Well, it turns out I loved her, but I wasn't in love with her."
2,15,4,AMY,Trouble in bed.
2,15,4,BENDER,"Ah, it's great to have you back, buddy."
2,15,4,POOPENMEYER,Wait a-- This is no record! Gimmie back that cheque! I'm giving it to some giant orphans.
2,15,4,FRY,"Ow! Bender, you're hurting me. Ow!"
2,15,4,ZOIDBERG,Hey! I'm trying to sleep in here!
2,15,4,DONOVAN,Hail Atlanta!
