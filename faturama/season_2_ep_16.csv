2,16,0,"""BENDER GETS MADE""","By Eric Horstead Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
2,16,1,BENDER,"Wow! I'm finally gonna see my favourite chef, TV's Elzar. Oh this is the greatest nanosecond of my life. No, this one is - no, this one. Wait...that one was slightly worse. Ah, so far so good on this one."
2,16,1,BENDER,Yeah! Alright! Yeah baby!
2,16,1,MAN,Elzar! Alright!
2,16,1,BENDER,"Elzar, you're my god. Please sign this sketch I drew of you."
2,16,1,ELZAR,"Now, this is why I prefer your non-stick robots."
2,16,1,BENDER,"Oh. Alright, yeah! Alright, yeah!"
2,16,1,ELZAR,"Hey, I hope you folks like Cajun food. 'Cause today we're making Elzar's down-home Neptune-style gumbo. Now, step one. You'll wanna boil some oysters in a pot of down-home Neptune-style gumbo."
2,16,1,BENDER,Boiled? Interesting.
2,16,1,LEELA,"Bender, please try to be a little quieter."
2,16,1,BENDER,"No, you shut up."
2,16,1,ELZAR,"Of course, every now and then you'll wanna knock it up a notch with a blast from your spice weasel. Bam!"
2,16,1,BENDER,"Oh yeah, bam it again Elzar. Knock it up another notch!"
2,16,1,ELZAR,"Jeez, who let this guy through the metal detector?"
2,16,1,BENDER,Come on you wimp. Work that weasel. Quit holding out on us.
2,16,1,ELZAR,"If you promise to stop interrupting alright. Against my will, I'm gonna knock it up another notch."
2,16,1,BENDER,"I gotta get this notch-up knocking on film. Hey Elzar, think fast."
2,16,1,ELZAR,"What, huh?"
2,16,1,LEELA,Ow! My eye! I'm blind!
2,16,1,BENDER,Bam!
2,16,2,HATTIE,"Tell me doctor, how's my cyst?"
2,16,2,HATTIE'S DOCTOR,Grande.
2,16,2,ZOIDBERG,I don't like the look of this doctor. I bet I've lost more patients than he's even treated.
2,16,2,DOCTOR,
2,16,2,LEELA,Um...a grey-ish blob?
2,16,2,DOCTOR,Right. And this one?
2,16,2,LEELA,Um...a grey-ish blob?
2,16,2,DOCTOR,Not as right that time. It looks like you might have some mild corneal irritation.
2,16,2,ZOIDBERG,Nice try little boy. You might have your textbook knowledge and your real diploma but I have more skill in my little claw than you have in your whole carapace.
2,16,2,DOCTOR,You seem a bit tense. Here try these.
2,16,2,ZOIDBERG,"Sure, butter me up with candy. But it won't work sonny! Why always the fighting?"
2,16,2,DOCTOR,Your eye just needs some rest. You'll have to wear this patch for about a week.
2,16,2,LEELA,A week? What do you think Dr Zoidberg?
2,16,2,ZOIDBERG,Clack.
2,16,2,ZOIDBERG,Thanks for the help Leela.
2,16,2,AMY,"Leela, we're right here."
2,16,2,LEELA,I'm not deaf. I just have to wear this stupid eye patch. Does it look stupid?
2,16,2,FRY,"No. In fact, it looks so nice I think I might get one too."
2,16,2,BENDER,It's Elzar again! Oh my God I'm so excited I wish I could wet my pants.
2,16,2,ELZAR,"Leela, please, let me make this up to you. You and your friends are all invited to my restaurant tonight. I'm gonna bam you up a dinner you'll never forget."
2,16,2,AMY,Alright!
2,16,2,FRY,Yeah!
2,16,2,BENDER,Hooray for blindy!
2,16,2,ZOIDBERG,Oh God. I'm coming dowwwn!
2,16,3,ELZAR,Folks tell the neighbours to watch your mouth 'cause your tastebuds are going on vacation. I made you each your own special meal so dig in!
2,16,3,HERMES,"It's the biggest Jamaican platter I've ever seen. Jerk chicken, jerk beef, jerk pork. Is there any meat this man can't jerk?"
2,16,3,ZOIDBERG,"The king crab is to die for! Look, a tiny edible crown!"
2,16,3,AMY,What's it made of?
2,16,3,ZOIDBERG [EATING],Wood!
2,16,3,BENDER,"Oh Fry, you gotta try this sterno-nicoise!"
2,16,3,FRY,No thanks. That's robot food.
2,16,3,BENDER,It's so good. Oh just try a little!
2,16,3,FRY,No really I don't - Mmm!
2,16,3,AMY,You doing alright over there Leela?
2,16,3,LEELA,"Oh yeah, this salad's fantastic. So fresh."
2,16,4,FARNSWORTH,Oh my. That steamed carrot was a bit spicy for me.
2,16,4,ELZAR,Everybody enjoy their dinner?
2,16,4,LEELA,Are you kidding me?
2,16,4,AMY,Uh-huh.
2,16,4,BENDER,"God, yes Elzar."
2,16,4,ELZAR,"Well, I enjoyed cooking for you. And just to make everything completely square, I want you to have these complimentary after-dinner chocolates."
2,16,4,HERMES,What's this under the chocolates?
2,16,4,ELZAR,"Yeah, you take care of that whenever you want."
2,16,4,HERMES,Hey.
2,16,4,AMY,A bill?
2,16,4,LEELA,You're charging us? After you blinded me?
2,16,4,ELZAR,Hey I made you a nice meal. This ain't a charity.
2,16,4,$1200?,
2,16,4,FARNSWORTH,Holy Zombie Jesus!
2,16,4,HERMES,We don't have that kind of money. Especially not Zoidberg.
2,16,4,ZOIDBERG,They took away my credit card.
2,16,4,ELZAR,
2,16,4,URL,You deadbeats are under arrest. It's a stone cold shame.
2,16,4,SMITTY,He's making a break for it. Get him!
2,16,4,FRY,"No, I was just picking my nose."
2,16,4,SMITTY,He's picking his nose. Get him!
2,16,4,SMITTY,The old dine-and-dash huh? My daddy owned a restaurant and it's punks like you who kept it from going regional. That's why I became a cop.
2,16,4,URL,Now it's payback time. Aww yeah.
2,16,4,ZOIDBERG,Please don't hit me. I'm brittle.
2,16,4,BENDER,Hey wait a second. I've got the perfect solution.
2,16,4,ZOIDBERG,Listen to the smart robot.
2,16,4,BENDER,I love cooking and Elzar's ass likes getting kissed right?
2,16,4,ELZAR,No question.
2,16,4,BENDER,"So, how 'bout I work part time at the restaurant to pay off our debt?"
2,16,4,ELZAR,I don't know. I usually hire people who are a little less unbearable.
2,16,4,HERMES,"Oh, Bender's a model employee."
2,16,4,AMY,He's so polite.
2,16,4,LEELA,And hard working.
2,16,4,FRY,He's made of candy.
2,16,4,ELZAR,
2,16,4,FRY,Alright!
2,16,4,HERMES,Yes!
2,16,4,BENDER,Hot diggety!
2,16,4,SMITTY,You'd better keep your nose clean.
2,16,4,BENDER,That'll be easy. I never wear the damn thing.
2,16,4,HERMES,Ah. Time for my precious 10am meeting. Where in Legoland is Leela?
2,16,4,LEELA,I'm here and I'm getting along just fine thank you. My walk to work today just took a little longer than usual. Nibbler took me through the zoo for some reason.
2,16,4,AMY,"Leela, a little help is nothing to be embarrassed about. Like, maybe I could do your makeup."
2,16,4,LEELA,I don't need help. For you information I did this all by myself.
2,16,4,FARNSWORTH,"You look beautiful. Incidentally, my favourite artist is Picasso."
2,16,4,BENDER,"Well, I'm off to work at the restaurant. One of you will have to fill in for me while I'm gone."
2,16,4,FARNSWORTH,"Better yet, I'll build someone to fill in for you. Some kind of gamma powered mechanical monster, with freeway on-ramps for arms and a heart as black as coal..."
2,16,4,BENDER,"Well, if that new give can't handle thing, gimmie a call."
2,16,4,BENDER,"I'm done siphoning out the grease trap. I think I need a mint. So uh, what job do I move up to? Pastry chef? Saucier? Soup guy?"
2,16,4,ELZAR,Bam!
2,16,4,BENDER,"Bam yourself! Hey, who are they?"
2,16,4,ELZAR,Let's just say they're very good customers and I'm not answering anymore questions.
2,16,4,BENDER,Are they the robot mafia?
2,16,4,ELZAR,Yes.
2,16,5,DONBOT,You call this a table? You call this a table? I wouldn't hit a guy over the head with this table.
2,16,5,CLAMPS,You hear that? The Donbot don't like it. I oughta clamp you - you wanna be clamped?
2,16,5,JOEY,"Whoa whoa, calm down Clamps. The boss, he likes a wall up which his back can be put against. Such as like this there."
2,16,5,WAITRESS,But that table's already -
2,16,5,BENDER,"Uh, let me bus that for you gentlemen. No, what I meant to do was..."
2,16,5,WOMAN,Oh!
2,16,5,MAN,I can't believe this!
2,16,5,BENDER,Mind your own business and get out!
2,16,5,DONBOT,Huh. I like this guy's lack of style.
2,16,5,CLAMPS,"...So I finally get this guy a pair of cement shoes which he likes, 'cause they're lighter than his lead ones."
2,16,5,DONBOT,Hey. You think this computes over here? Where's all my change? I gave you a hundred.
2,16,5,BENDER,No you gave me a fifty.
2,16,5,DONBOT,Oh no I didn't.
2,16,5,BENDER,Yeah you did.
2,16,5,CLAMPS,"Hey, you tryin' to steal from the Donbot?"
2,16,5,BENDER,I'm tryin' but he's not makin' it easy.
2,16,5,DONBOT,"Get a load of the ball bearings on this guy, huh. I like you kid. Here's something for your trouble. It's money."
2,16,5,BENDER,Wow thanks.
2,16,5,DONBOT,"Hey, you earned that 50 bucks."
2,16,5,BENDER,You gave me a twenty.
2,16,5,DONBOT,"I did? Oh I'm sorry I meant to - hey wait a minute. I got a good feeling about you. Say, you wanna work for me as a hired goon?"
2,16,5,BENDER,"Are you kidding? I've always wanted to break into gooning! Hey Elzar, I quit."
2,16,5,DONBOT,"We're gonna try you out with a little delivery job. It's for a uh, private lottery that we run."
2,16,5,BENDER,"Wow, you guys run numbers?!"
2,16,5,CLAMPS,"Well, nothing fancy. Just ones and zeros mostly."
2,16,5,DONBOT,"Just take this disk over to the pool hall and give it to Sammy ""The Mechanical Bull"" Gravano. And watch out for the cops."
2,16,5,BENDER,That's just what my mom used to tell me.
2,16,6,BENDER,That's some fine oil-ade son. We could use a man like you in the Robot Mafia which I'm sorta in.
2,16,6,TINNY TIM,You flatter me kind goon. But I'm only programmed to sell oil-ade and write in cute backwards letters like on the sign here.
2,16,6,BENDER,"Aw crap, the cops."
2,16,6,SMITTY,Seen any suspicious activity?
2,16,6,URL,Nope. But check out today's Marmaduke. Solid!
2,16,6,SMITTY,Hey. It's that skell from Elzar's.
2,16,6,URL,Undercover pursuit in progress...baby.
2,16,6,SMITTY,Gotcha!
2,16,6,BENDER,What seems to be the problem officers? Was I speeding?
2,16,6,SMITTY,We'll decide what you were doing after an illegal search.
2,16,6,URL,He's clean. Smells nice too.
2,16,6,SMITTY,Better than me?
2,16,6,URL,Aww yeah.
2,16,6,TINNY TIM,Courtesy of Mr Bender.
2,16,6,DONBOT,"Nice job Bender, you passed the test. You wanna joi me, Clamps and Joey Mousepad at out uh, social club tomorrow night?"
2,16,6,BENDER,"Uh, I'd rather plan some fellonies."
2,16,6,DONBOT,Oh. Then we should meet at our Mafia crime headquarters.
2,16,7,ROBOT,"Donbot, I beg you, I can't make this week's loan payment. Look into your hard drive and open your mercy file."
2,16,7,DONBOT,File not found. Let that be a warning to you.
2,16,7,ROBOT,Thank you Donbot.
2,16,7,BENDER,"Joey, Clamps, Donny B!"
2,16,7,DONBOT,"Hey listen Bender. We got a big score planned but uh, we need some muscle."
2,16,7,BENDER,A little of this huh?
2,16,7,JOEY,"Ho ho, this guy's an ox! He's got oxon-like strength! Hey, he needs a nickname right? Let's call him Clamps."
2,16,7,CLAMPS,Clamps? That's my name you numbskull! Don't make me clamp you one!
2,16,7,BENDER,"How 'bout ""Blotto""? It's witty, it's got street cred. Plus I can keep my monogrammed slippers."
2,16,7,JOEY,"Good thinking! Hey hey! Now, this score ain't gonna be no cake walk in the tea park alright, there may be some death killing."
2,16,7,CLAMPS,"It's gonna be clamp this, clamp that, bada-climp, bada-clamp."
2,16,7,DONBOT,What d'you think Blotto? You in?
2,16,7,BENDER,It's funny. Until now I always wanted to be a gangster...so the answer's yes.
2,16,7,CLAMPS,Yeah!
2,16,7,JOEY,Hey hey! Way to go way to be way to shoot!
2,16,7,DONBOT,"Now since we're committing crimes that may be against the law, I suggest you have an alibi."
2,16,7,BENDER,An alibi huh?
2,16,8,FRY,But we're about to take off. We gotta eat our blastoff sundaes.
2,16,9,FRY [FROM OUTSIDE],
2,16,10,FRY,Bender's sick. Need any help taking off?
2,16,10,LEELA,I'm fine thank you. A real pilot can navigate by feel alone.
2,16,12,HERMES,That's coming outta your pay!
2,16,12,BENDER,You know the secret of traditional robot cooking? Start with a good high-quality oil...then eat it. So whats this big score anyway?
2,16,12,DONBOT,We're heisting a shipment of Zuban cigars.
2,16,12,BENDER,Zubans? Those are the finest cigars in the universe. I can stink up a hole maternity ward with one of those things.
2,16,12,JOEY,Yo there's our pigeon now. Let's shoot bullets out of our guns.
2,16,12,DONBOT,"Alright, here's the battleplan: We shoot, they surrender, we go aboard, somebody does some clamping then we heist the cigars and go home."
2,16,12,BENDER,And all without killing anyone. This gang's got some fresh new ideas. I admire that.
2,16,12,JOEY,"Oh, we'll kill 'em alright."
2,16,12,CLAMPS,We got 'em heavily out-clamped. They won't know what clamped 'em!
2,16,13,FRY,"Wow, it's too bad you can't see Leela 'cause theres a cool ship out there shooting at somebody."
2,16,13,LEELA,I'm taking evasive action.
2,16,13,FRY,"Uh, Leela?"
2,16,13,LEELA,"Stop bothering me Fry, I need full concentration."
2,16,16,COMPUTER VOICE,Missile evaded.
2,16,16,LEELA,Eyesight is for chumps.
2,16,17,DONBOT,"Their desire to keep living shows me no respect. Hey Blotto, roll down the window and start shooting."
2,16,17,BENDER,"Um, uh, um. Ooh ow! He got me! Ow, what a shot that guy is."
2,16,18,LEELA,"Wait. Why do the raised letters that normally say ""Turnmaster Steering company"" say ""Nibbler""? Oh no!"
2,16,19,LEELA [ON SCREEN],I'm back at the wheel Fry. Everything's under control.
2,16,19,FRY,"Great, great. The one time I forgot to buy flight insurance."
2,16,20,JOEY,They're coming straight towards our proximity. Maybe you should give 'em the clamps Clamps.
2,16,20,CLAMPS,Gee you think? You think that maybe I should use these clamps that I use every day at every opportunity? You're a freaking genius you idiot!
2,16,21,LEELA,The engine's stalled. I'm trying the manual fuel pump.
2,16,21,DONBOT,"Hello, we're the Robot Mafia. The entire Robot Mafia. We're here to steal your cigars."
2,16,21,LEELA,You'll never get away with this.
2,16,21,FRY,Unless you let us live. Then you'll get off scot free.
2,16,21,DONBOT,"Joey, Clamps, hurry and blindfold them before they see us some more."
2,16,21,JOEY,"Hey boss, looks like somebody beat us to it."
2,16,21,LEELA,"I'll assume that's a joke at my expense. Well, who's laughing now? Heyya!"
2,16,21,DONBOT,Hey where's Blotto? He should be here learning the trade.
2,16,23,BENDER,"Sorry I'm tardy old bean, I was just enjoying a rather tasty watercress sandwich."
2,16,23,DONBOT,Hey. He's more classy than I realised. Tie up the prisoners.
2,16,23,BENDER,"Capital idea old sport. I say, get the hell off me!"
2,16,23,LEELA,That guy sounds familiar.
2,16,23,BENDER,"My word, what have we - Uh, nothing to see here old girl."
2,16,23,JOEY,"Hey boss, this here crew list lists a robot on this crew here."
2,16,23,DONBOT,Alright. I want you to find him and plug him. Then unplug him.
2,16,23,FRY,No!
2,16,23,CLAMPS,I got a little surprise in store for that guy. The clamps! Eh?
2,16,23,BENDER,"Uh wait, old...spice. Let me have a go at this mechanised chap. I can be quite the rough customer."
2,16,25,FRY,"Oh no, poor Bender."
2,16,26,BENDER,...Take that you twit. No! Stop it!
2,16,26,DONBOT,"That's the last of 'em. Alright now let's Mafia things up a little. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew."
2,16,26,BENDER,"Uh, hey Donny, baby, gimmie a chance here huh? Yous guys skidaddle. Let me take care of the doity woik."
2,16,26,DONBOT,"Hey, I like your attitude. And your latest accent. Keep it up and I might just get you your own pair of clamps huh?"
2,16,26,CLAMPS,He's gonna get clamps? Clamps clamps......clamps clamps!
2,16,26,BENDER,Phew.
2,16,27,FRY,"Leela, we may not have much time left......so let's spend all of it reminscing about Bender. He was like a big computer than ran on magic."
2,16,27,BENDER,"Uh, help! Help!"
2,16,27,LEELA,Bender!
2,16,27,FRY,You're OK!
2,16,27,BENDER,Yes I am. Having just this minute regained consciousness.
2,16,27,LEELA,"I've got an idea. Hold still. It's about to break, yes, yes!"
2,16,27,LEELA,Alright!
2,16,27,BENDER,Yeah it broke alright
2,16,28,FRY,"I'm telling you, Leela was cool, she was in command, and when she kicked people it hurt. It really hurt."
2,16,28,LEELA,"Well, this is the big moment. It's finally time to take my patch off."
2,16,28,ZOIDBERG,I'll handle the snipping. Afterall I do have the proper equipment.
2,16,28,LEELA,I think it's Blotto. That gangster I saw when my patch fell off. Professor? Where were you at 10pm last night?
2,16,28,FARNSWORTH,Where am I now?
2,16,28,BENDER,So they sent a helpless child to kill me? Well I'm not going out without a fight.
2,16,28,TINNY TIM,Fine kick sir. But I'm actually here to deliver your cut from the cigar heist.
2,16,28,BENDER,"Oh sweet legal tender! Kid, tell the Donbot I'm quitting organised crime. From now on I'll stick to regular kind."
2,16,28,FRY,It's funny Bender. With you sick and Leela blind only I know what really went on out there. Maybe someday I'll tell you the whole story.
2,16,28,BENDER,And maybe someday I won't listen.
