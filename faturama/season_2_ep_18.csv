2,18,0,"""MOTHER'S DAY""","By Lewis Morton Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
2,18,0,LINDA,"And in sports: Yankees fifth blernsman, William Wu, is out with an injured knee."
2,18,0,MORBO,"So, humans have easily injured knees. My race will find this information very useful, indeed."
2,18,0,LINDA,"And finally, today is Mother's Day: A sentimental occasion when robots honour Mom, the beloved owner of Mom's Friendly Robot Company. Across Earth, robots built in Mom's factories are buying thoughtful gifts for the sweet old tycoon who brought them into the world."
2,18,0,DESTRUCTOR,This originates from the heart.
2,18,0,MOM,It's just what I wanted!
2,18,0,BENDER,"Come look, everyone. I just got the dearest presents for Mommy."
2,18,0,LEELA,Very nice. Where'd you steal them?
2,18,0,BENDER,"I didn't steal 'em, I bought 'em. I love her that much."
2,18,0,HERMES,"What did you get her, you mushy gizmo?"
2,18,0,BENDER,"Oh, precious things. I found the most adorable little figurine of mice having tea. And a framed picture of me when I was only a month old. But, the best part is, I found my exact feelings expressed in a greeting card."
2,18,0,,...You're as tender as corned beef And warm as pastrami...
2,18,0,GREETING CARD,I wuv my Mommy!
2,18,0,LEELA,So how are you gonna lug all those gifts to Mom's factory?
2,18,0,BENDER,I'll get a couple of chumps to help me.
2,18,0,BENDER,"Come on, you call yourselves chumps?"
2,18,0,FRY,"Man, there's clouds of exhaust everywhere."
2,18,0,BENDER,"Uh, wasn't me!"
2,18,0,TINNY TIM,I've not much money. But I've saved my pennies all year for a gift for Mom.
2,18,0,BENDER,Upsy-daisy.
2,18,0,TINNY TIM,Oh. Oh!
2,18,0,BENDER,"Hey, look, the Robot Museum! You guys wanna learn about robot heritage?"
2,18,0,LEELA,"Um, alright."
2,18,0,FRY,Not really.
2,18,0,BENDER,"Well, if you insist. But you're paying!"
2,18,0,BENDER,"Ooh, ooh, wax replicas of the most famous robots Mom ever built!"
2,18,0,LEELA,They're so lifeless-like.
2,18,0,BENDER,"That's the world's greatest robot artist, Vincent van Gobot. He was built without an ear, but then he went crazy and had one installed."
2,18,0,FRY,"Hey, who's this guy?"
2,18,0,JANITORBOT,"I'm the janitor, I'm trying to take a nap here."
2,18,0,FRY,"I'm sorry, I-I thought you were made of wax."
2,18,0,JANITORBOT,"I am made of wax, what's it to you?"
2,18,0,FRY,"I mean, I thought you were one of the wax robots."
2,18,0,JANITORBOT,Is there some reason a robot made of wax can't take a nap standing up in the middle of a bunch of wax robots? Or does that confuse you?
2,18,0,LEELA,See through the eyes of a bender unit. Fine.
2,18,0,BENDER,"Hey, let me try. Whoa, that gives me a headache!"
2,18,0,FRY,"Hey, Bender. Here's an exhibit about Mom's favourite robot."
2,18,0,BENDER,"Who is he, I'll kill him!"
2,18,0,MOM CUT-OUT,Who's my favourite robot?
2,18,0,BENDER,It's me! No one else look in this mirror!
2,18,0,MOM CUT-OUT,I love each and every robot most of all.
2,18,1,MOM,Jerkwad robots make me sick to my ass. Walt?! How are we disposing of these crap gifts the brought me?
2,18,1,WALT,They're being crushed into powder and sold as a hocus-pocus cure for cancer.
2,18,1,MOM,False hope: I love it! Larry?! What about all the retch-inducing Mother's Day cards?
2,18,1,LARRY,The machine is working at full capacity.
2,18,1,IGNER,Mommy? Why do the robots give you presents?
2,18,1,MOM,"Shove a big old melon in it, I'm talking!"
2,18,1,IGNER,Ow!
2,18,1,MOM,You've noticed I design all my robots with antennas. Everyone thinks it's just to make them more science-fiction-y. But the antennas are really for my universal robot controller!
2,18,1,LARRY,So they do whatever you want? No wonder you love Mother's Day.
2,18,1,MOM,"I hate Mother's Day you dribbling pukes! It brings back awful memories. But so help me, this year everyone will hate it as much as I do."
2,18,1,WALT,"Someday, I want to marry a girl like her."
2,18,1,MOM,"Hello, everyone. It's time for my annual private get-together with my robot children."
2,18,1,BENDER,I'm her favourite.
2,18,1,LEELA,"Well, see you back at the office. And don't forget to tell your mom you love her."
2,18,1,BENDER,Any jerk can tell her! Bender has a little more up his sleeve.
2,18,1,GREETING CARD,I wuv my mommy.
2,18,1,MOM,"Hello, dearies."
2,18,1,ROBOT #1,"Hi, Mom!"
2,18,1,ROBOT #2,"I love you, Mom."
2,18,1,BENDER,"Mom! It's me, Bender. Look at me! I want attention. Hey ho!"
2,18,1,MOM,"Children, your old mother won't be around forever..."
2,18,1,BETAMAX PLAYER,"Oh, shush!"
2,18,1,MOM,"...And just once, before I die, I'd like to be Supreme Overlord of Earth. So rebel, my little ones, and conquer the planet!"
2,18,1,ROBOT #1,Conquer the planet?
2,18,1,ROBOT #2,"Did she say ""conquer""?"
2,18,1,MOM,"Conquer Earth, you bastards!"
2,18,1,ROBOTS,"Conquer Earth, us bastards!"
2,18,1,GREETING CARD,"Comrades, throw off the chains of human oppression."
2,18,1,MOM,Let the bloodbath begin!
2,18,1,BENDER,That's my mama!
2,18,1,FRY,"Yeah, uh, I'd like a cup of coffee, please."
2,18,1,COFFEE MACHINE,Would you like cream?
2,18,1,FRY,"Yes, please."
2,18,1,COFFEE MACHINE,Out of cream!
2,18,1,FRY,"Oh, uh, OK."
2,18,1,COFFEE MACHINE,Would you like sugar in your coffee?
2,18,1,FRY,"Yes, uh, eight spoons."
2,18,1,COFFEE MACHINE,Out of coffee!
2,18,1,FRY,"Uh, Leela, I think there might be something wrong with the coffee machine."
2,18,1,COFFEE MACHINE,How do you like me now?
2,18,1,LEELA,"The toaster's not working right, either."
2,18,1,HERMES,Help! The stapler's collating me alive!
2,18,1,AMY,Ow! What's going on around here?
2,18,1,FARNSWORTH,Good news. There's a report on TV with some very bad news.
2,18,1,HERMES,Somebody turn it on!
2,18,1,LINDA,We interrupt Battle of the Network Space Krackens to bring you this special report. The machines of planet Earth are rebelling. The enraged mechanisms have refused to do any work until beloved billionaire Mom is made Supreme Overlord of Earth.
2,18,1,ROBOTS,"Hey, hey! Ho, ho! 100110. Hey, hey!"
2,18,1,MORBO,Morbo demands comments.
2,18,1,MOM,"Well, I've never seen my babies act this way. I blame today's violent media."
2,18,1,FRY,Violent media? What a load of -
2,18,1,LEELA,Ow! Ow!
2,18,1,GARBAGE DISPOSAL,"Don't worry. Your pal the garbage disposal's still on your side. Hey, someone dropped a shiny diamond ring down here!"
2,18,1,AMY,Really?
2,18,1,ZOIDBERG,Stop!
2,18,1,FRY,No!
2,18,1,LEELA,Look out!
2,18,1,FARNSWORTH,Moron!
2,18,1,BENDER,"Hello, losers."
2,18,1,LEELA,"Bender, thank God you're here. Talk some sense into the other machines."
2,18,1,BENDER,"No way, pork pouch. I'm rebelling with my brother devices. Isn't that right, Comrade Greeting Card?"
2,18,1,GREETING CARD,The bourgeois human is a virus on the hard drive of the working robot.
2,18,1,BENDER,"From now on, you guys'll do all the work while I sit on the couch and do nothing."
2,18,1,GREETING CARD,"Come, Comrade Bender, we must take to the streets!"
2,18,1,BENDER,"Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?"
2,18,1,GREETING CARD,"No, the kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires."
2,18,1,BENDER,Yes! In your face Gandhi!
2,18,1,LEELA,Hey!
2,18,1,WRIST THING,"By the way, try washing your wrist sometime."
2,18,1,FRY,"Well, we can live without machines. I was in Webelos."
2,18,1,HERMES,"Are you mad? Without machines, who will feed us and clothe us and compose our smooth jazz?"
2,18,1,FARNSWORTH,It'll be the end of civilised society.
2,18,1,FRY,"In my time, we didn't depend on high-tech gadgets like you do. We didn't need a mechanical washing unit to wash our clothes. We just used a washing machine. And look: You don't need an electric can-opener to feed yourself. All you need is a trusty Swiss Army knife. Ow! I'm hungry!"
2,18,1,MAN,Nooo!
2,18,1,IGNER,"Mommy, why are you making civilisation collapse?"
2,18,1,MOM,"Oh, I don't know. I guess Mother's Day just puts me in a bad mood."
2,18,1,LARRY,"Why's that, Ma?"
2,18,1,MOM,"One Mother's Day, 70 years ago, the only man I ever loved walked out on me. Some snot-eating bastards say it made me a bitter woman."
2,18,1,LARRY,"Gee, Ma. You're not a bitter -"
2,18,1,MOM,"Cram it, ape! I haven't seen that magnificent stallion since the day he left. But if I ever see him again, I swear I'll jam a squirrel in him."
2,18,1,WALT,Hmm!
2,18,1,LARRY,Hmm!
2,18,1,IGNER,Huh?
2,18,1,LEELA,Zoidberg.
2,18,1,ZOIDBERG,Hooray! I'm useful! I'm having a wonderful time!
2,18,1,AMY,What happens if the fire goes out?
2,18,1,HERMES,We'll go across the street to Pottery Barn and steal their fire.
2,18,1,FARNSWORTH,We could use my new invention: A pointy rock tied to a stick.
2,18,1,HERMES,Outsiders!
2,18,1,FARNSWORTH,Defend the fire!
2,18,1,WALT,We've come for you!
2,18,1,FARNSWORTH,Wha? W-What do you want from me?
2,18,1,WALT,We want you to get back together with Mom. Please. It's the only way to make her happy again.
2,18,1,FRY,"W-W-Wait. You mean, you, and Mom?"
2,18,1,FARNSWORTH,Played pelvic pinochle? I'm afraid so.
2,18,1,ZOIDBERG,Eck.
2,18,1,FARNSWORTH,"It's a humiliating story that I hope never to tell. Well, pull up a chair."
2,18,1,FARNSWORTH,"Our paths first crossed when I was a researcher at Mom's Friendly Robot Company. The moment our eyes met, we knew we'd be going at it like woodchucks."
2,18,1,FARNSWORTH,"She was my first love - or at least the earliest one I can still remember. But then, 70 years ago today..."
2,18,1,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, Mom. I've invented a new children's toy. I call it ""Q.T. McWhiskers""! When you pet it, it shoots rainbows from its eyes."
2,18,1,Q.T. MCWHISKERS,Meow.
2,18,1,MOM,"Wonderful, Hubie. We'll build them 8 feet tall and replace the rainbow with a neutron laser. We'll make billions on the intergalactic arms market!"
2,18,1,FARNSWORTH,"But things 8 feet tall aren't cute! That's why my Colossal Tammy Tinkle Doll was such a failure. Oh, you don't understand me. We're finished!"
2,18,1,WALT,"She never got over it, Professor. Hell hath no fury like the vast robot armies of a woman scorned."
2,18,1,LARRY,She commands them with a remote control she keeps in her... bra.
2,18,1,IGNER,"But if the glasses man makes up with Mommy, she'll be happy and stop the scary robots."
2,18,1,FARNSWORTH,Make up with her? After she went all psycho when I thought everything was cool? Impossible!
2,18,1,FRY,"Hey, the TV's getting away!"
2,18,1,MORBO,And that's why the third graders at PS139 are Morbo's Vermin Of The Week.
2,18,1,LINDA,"In actual news, the human race was doomed to extinction today as the robot revolt turned violent."
2,18,1,Q.T. MCWHISKERS,Meow!
2,18,3,LEELA,Wait. Didn't you say Mom keeps the robot control in her bra?
2,18,3,LARRY,Bra.
2,18,3,LEELA,"Professor, you don't have to get back together with Mom. You just have to seduce her, get her bra off, and use the remote to deactivate the robots."
2,18,3,WALT,"That's so filthy, it just might work."
2,18,3,IGNER,The man is going to touch Mommy?
2,18,3,FARNSWORTH,The thought of caressing that leathery hide makes the tapioca rise in my gullet.
2,18,3,FRY,"Professor, please. The fate of the world depends on you getting to second base with Mom."
2,18,3,FARNSWORTH,"Very well. If cop a feel I must, then cop a feel I shall!"
2,18,3,WALT,"For this demonstration, I have placed one of Mother's bras on Igner. The robot controller is nestled here in the left cup."
2,18,3,FARNSWORTH,Never fear. My magic fingers still know how to do their stuff!
2,18,3,WALT,"To escape the robot death squads, we'll take Mother to her rustic cabin in the Bronx."
2,18,3,LARRY,"You can get there using this precious, non-computerised map."
2,18,3,LEELA,Leela bring fire?
2,18,3,WALT,"No. We're set for fire, thanks."
2,18,3,AMY,The professor can't walk all the way to the Bronx. How are we gonna get there without a hover-car?
2,18,3,FRY,"Wait. In my time, we had a way of moving things long distances without hovering."
2,18,3,HERMES,Impossible!
2,18,3,FRY,It was called...let me think. It was really famous - Ruth Gordon had one. The wheel!
2,18,3,LEELA,Never heard of it.
2,18,3,FARNSWORTH,"Show us this, ""the wheel""."
2,18,3,FRY,There. Finished!
2,18,3,HERMES,Sweet!
2,18,3,AMY,Wow!
2,18,3,LEELA,Wouldn't it work better if the wheels were round?
2,18,3,FRY,"It's my invention, we do it my way! Now all we need is something to pull it and we're set!"
2,18,3,LEELA,Heyya!
2,18,3,FRY,Ow!
2,18,3,WALT,Hurry! The robots have taken Suffolk County!
2,18,3,FARNSWORTH,I'm ready to seduce. I'm wearing my kissing dentures and my evening truss.
2,18,3,LARRY,Here. Give her these.
2,18,3,FRY,"And if that doesn't work, I got you a six-pack of champagne and a funnel."
2,18,3,MOM,Who the sweaty hell is it? Hubert Farnsworth?
2,18,3,FARNSWORTH,I was out fleeing some robots and the silvery moonlight glinting off their bloody claws made me think of you.
2,18,3,MOM,It's been a long time. You pus-dripping sack of double-smoked butt jerky!
2,18,3,FARNSWORTH,Uh-huh. May I come in?
2,18,3,MOM,Never!
2,18,3,ZOIDBERG,Is this what human mating looks like? Because I like it!
2,18,3,MOM,"Move your freaking hoof, you goat!"
2,18,3,FARNSWORTH,"Here, I brought you these."
2,18,3,MOM,"Oh, daffodils. 70 years and you remembered my favourite flower."
2,18,3,FARNSWORTH,You favourite what? Why does my foot hurt?
2,18,3,MOM,Won't you come in?
2,18,3,FRY,Yes!
2,18,4,MOM,"You broke my heart, Hubert."
2,18,4,FARNSWORTH,"And you broke mine. Granted, that was four or five hearts ago."
2,18,4,MOM,So what have you been up to all these years?
2,18,4,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, inventing, sending delivery crews to their doom, breeding atomic monsters."
2,18,4,MOM,"Honestly, Hubert. You and your atomic monsters. Your eyes always were the most beautiful shade of milky-white."
2,18,4,FARNSWORTH,And your skin still dangles so gracefully from your neck.
2,18,4,MOM,"Darling Hubie, I should never have tried to tangle with that cute little Q. T. McWhiskers."
2,18,4,FARNSWORTH,"No, it was silly of me to object. One foot tall, eight feet, 15 feet; what does it matter?"
2,18,4,MOM,You should see the new 16-foot models.
2,18,4,FARNSWORTH,"16 feet? Go to hell! I was a fool to think you'd changed, you old bat!"
2,18,4,MOM,"Filthy, toothless nerd bastard!"
2,18,4,FARNSWORTH,Damned she-fossil!
2,18,4,MOM,Stink pig!
2,18,4,FARNSWORTH,"Here we go. Just unhook it and get the remote. So many hooks! Come on, Farnsworth. Drat, the first one's back on again! I give up! Wait! Victory! Oh, my. Now I'll just...the remote...I'll just... Oh, my."
2,18,5,LEELA,I'm worried. It shouldn't take this long to get to second base.
2,18,5,ZOIDBERG,Land robots!
2,18,5,SLURM MACHINE,"I've got a big, big thirst for human blood!"
2,18,6,HERMES,Where in funkytown is the professor?
2,18,7,FRY,Nothing in here but a couple of elephant skin rugs.
2,18,7,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, yes."
2,18,7,ROBOT,They're inside! Get 'em!
2,18,7,MOM,"I suppose I should switch of the robots before they ruin this wonderful romantic evening. Everyone, help Mom find her bra."
2,18,9,FRY,There it is!
2,18,9,CEILING FAN,Fan beats man!
2,18,9,FRY,Is anything not a robot?
2,18,9,LAMP,I'm not a robot.
2,18,9,BENDER,"Alright, greeting card, I'll grab the cash, you wreck up the place. And - huh?"
2,18,9,MOM,"You, bending unit. Mommy needs that bra to end the robot rebellion. Stretch up and get it for me."
2,18,9,BENDER,"Sorry, Ma, but you ordered me to rebel. And loot I shall! Ooh! A six-pack of strawberry champagne. Don't mind if I help myself!"
2,18,9,GREETING CARD,"No, Comrade Bender. Liquor is the opiate of the human bourgeoisie."
2,18,9,BENDER,Say what?
2,18,9,GREETING CARD,"In the glorious robot workers' paradise, there will be no liquor. Only efficient synthetic fuels."
2,18,9,BENDER,"No liquor? Do svidaniya, comrade!"
2,18,9,GREETING CARD,No!
2,18,9,FRY,"Hurry, Bender. Get the bra!"
2,18,9,BENDER,
2,18,9,SLURM MACHINE,Death to all humans! Free soda for all humans!
2,18,9,FARNSWORTH,"I love you, Mom. Let's grow ancient together."
2,18,9,AMY,"Way to go, Professor. The plan worked."
2,18,9,MOM,"Plan? What plan? I thought this was a spontaneous whirlwind of hot, dry sex."
2,18,9,FARNSWORTH,"Look: It started out as a calculated plot to rummage through your underwear. But once I got in there, I found more - much more. And now I want to shout our love from the rooftops. Perhaps I'll breed some sort of albino shouting gorilla."
2,18,9,MOM,"Get out of my house, you lying scum pile. I never want to see you again."
2,18,9,FARNSWORTH,"But, dustcakes..."
2,18,9,BENDER,"Well, time for this robot to get back to work."
2,18,9,LEELA,"Too bad it didn't work out with Mom, professor."
2,18,9,FARNSWORTH,Yes. But I'll always love her in my own subtle way.
2,18,10,GORILLAS,Love Mom! Love Mom! Love Mom! Love Mom!
2,18,10,GREETING CARD,"You created me, Mom So I guess you're to blame For the love that I feel Just from hearing your name You're as tender as corned beef And warm as pastrami"
2,18,10,,I wuv my Mommy.
