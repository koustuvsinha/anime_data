2,3,0,"""FRY AND THE SLURM FACTORY""","By Lewis Morton Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
2,3,0,CALCULON,"Honey unit, I'm home. Monique!"
2,3,0,MONIQUE,Calculon!
2,3,0,CALCULON,"Oh, how I wish I could believe that. You may be my evil half-brother, but there's no law against murdering the other half."
2,3,0,ANNOUNCER #1,All My Circuits will be right back after this word from...
2,3,0,ANNOUNCER #2,... Slurm! It's highly addictive!
2,3,0,BABE,Look! It's Slurms MacKenzie!
2,3,0,DIXIE,He's the original party worm!
2,3,0,SLURMS,Whimmy-wham-wham-wazzle! Let's party!
2,3,0,BENDER,Look at that worm go. Who says there are no more heroes?
2,3,0,SLURMS,"Hey, dudes, you can win a chance to party with me, Slurms MacKenzie, at the Slurm bottling plant on planet Wormulon!"
2,3,0,ANNOUNCER #2,Just look for the winning bottle-cap inside specially-marked cans of Slurm.
2,3,0,BABE,I won!
2,3,0,SLURM ANNOUNCER #2,No purchase necessary unless you wish to enter the contest. Odds of winning mathematically insignificant.
2,3,0,FRY,I like those odds. Rats. Just another tooth. Aah!
2,3,0,FRY,I gotta find that golden bottle-cap.
2,3,0,LEELA,I've never seen anyone so addicted to Slurm.
2,3,0,FRY,This is nothing. Back in high school I used to drink a hundred cans of cola a week. Right up until my third heart attack.
2,3,0,LEELA,"Bender, what's wrong?"
2,3,0,BENDER,I'm sick.
2,3,0,LEELA,You poor baby. Let me check if you have a fever. Ow!
2,3,0,FARNSWORTH,"According to Bender's temperature gauge, which I suggest you use next time, Leela, he's running a fever of ... 900 degrees."
2,3,0,HERMES,"Bender, mon, lie yourself down. You're payin' for that!"
2,3,0,ZOIDBERG,"I'll have a look, but I remind you, I'm an expert on humans not robots."
2,3,0,FRY,"I'm not Bender, I'm Fry."
2,3,0,ZOIDBERG,Really? I though you were the robot.
2,3,0,FRY,Nope. Human.
2,3,0,ZOIDBERG,"Alright, alright, spare me your life story. Now what seems to be the trouble?"
2,3,0,BENDER,My tummy hurts and I've been having this burning electrical discharge.
2,3,0,ZOIDBERG,"Hmm. Don't worry, you'll be fine. Oh boy. I didn't have the heart to tell him: It's fin fungus. He'll be floating upside-down by morning."
2,3,0,AMY,"You should try homeopathic medicine, Bender. Take some zinc."
2,3,0,BENDER,I'm 40% zinc.
2,3,0,AMY,Then take some Echinaea or a St. John's wort.
2,3,0,FARNSWORTH,Or a big fat placebo. It's all the same crap.
2,3,0,LEELA,"Hey, what's rattling around in there?"
2,3,0,FARNSWORTH,"It may well be the cause of Bender's illness. But more importantly, it's a flimsy pretext to try out my latest invention. To the laboratory!"
2,3,0,FARNSWORTH,"I call this the F-ray. It's like an X-ray only it allows you to see through anything - even metal. Now, the neutrino beam it emits is a tad dangerous, so you'll all need protective goggles. You may feel a slight stinging sensation - all of you-- All of you! Aha! There's the cause of your illness."
2,3,0,AMY,"Hey, that's my watch!"
2,3,0,BENDER,"I was wondering where I put that. Hey, now I feel much better! Thanks, Professor. And, Amy, I'm sorry I took your watch."
2,3,0,FARNSWORTH,"Well, I've got to go take this suit to the decontaminators. You two lock up the F-ray and for the love of God don't let it fall into the wrong hands."
2,3,0,BENDER,What should we point it at first?
2,3,0,FRY,I 'unno. Try it on me. Ow! My sperm!
2,3,0,BENDER,"Wow, neat! Mind if I try that again?"
2,3,0,FRY,"Huh, didn't hurt that time."
2,3,0,BENDER,"Whoa, mama! Hold still, sexy lady."
2,3,0,FRY,What's wrong?
2,3,0,BENDER,That's no lady!
2,3,0,"""FEMBOT""","Damn chico, one more upgrade and I'll be more lady than you can handle! Why you so stupid, stupid?"
2,3,0,BENDER,"Hey, bite my shiny metal ass!"
2,3,0,"""FEMBOT""","You couldn't afford it, honey."
2,3,0,FRY,"All this prolonged exposure to radiation is making me thirsty. Ah, if only there was some way of knowing which can had the winning bottle-cap inside."
2,3,0,BENDER,"Huh, w-what? I didn't hear you. I was too busy using this F-ray to look inside of things."
2,3,0,FRY,"Wait a second. I'm getting an idea. N-No, false alarm. No. Yeah. No. Yeah. No. Wait. No. Yeah. Yeah. No ... no. Yes!"
2,3,0,BENDER,"Ah, this thing stinks."
2,3,0,FRY,"We checked 90,000 cans of Slurm and all we won was this junk. I never wanna see another can of Slurm again. Man, am I thirsty."
2,3,0,LEELA,"Fry, are you alright?"
2,3,0,BENDER,"You did it, Fry! You found the winning bottle-cap! We won!"
2,3,0,FRY,Hooray!
2,3,1,LEELA,"Ooh, look at that!"
2,3,1,BENDER,Hey!
2,3,1,GLURMO,"Welcome to the planet Wormulon. I'm Glurmo, your golly-rific guide to the splend-tacular Slurm factory."
2,3,1,FRY,Uh-huh. Can we have our free Slurm now?
2,3,1,GLURMO,You'll have all the Slurm you can drink later on when you're partying with my good friend Slurms MacKenzie.
2,3,1,SLURMS,"Alright! Whimmy-wham-wham-wazzle! Lay some skin on me, dudes!"
2,3,1,BENDER,"Wow! The original party worm! Are you ready to get down, get funky with us?"
2,3,1,GLURMO,"He'd better be, that's what we pay him for. Right, Slurms?"
2,3,1,SLURMS,Right!
2,3,1,GLURMO,"In fact, Slurms has to party all night, every night - or he's fired!"
2,3,1,SLURMS,Rock on!
2,3,1,GLURMO,"But before the party, you're all in for a fun-derful treat: A VIP tour of the Slurm factory!"
2,3,1,SLURMS,"Enjoy the tour, dudes! I'm gonna go lie down."
2,3,1,GLURMO,"Welcome, my friends, to the wondrous world of whimsy that we like to call ""Slurms Centralised Industrial Fabrication Unit""."
2,3,2,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, my!"
2,3,2,BENDER,Look! Flowers! And a boat!
2,3,2,FARNSWORTH,Who are those horrible orange creatures over there?
2,3,2,GLURMO,Why those are the Grunka Lunkas. They work here in the Slurm factory.
2,3,2,FARNSWORTH,Tell them I hate them.
2,3,2,GLURMO,"As we sail down the river of Slurm you'll see our mix-ologists at work. They take 900 of the finest ingredients, add a touch of child-like delight and mix it all with glacial spring water from our glacial spring water generator. Then, last of all, we add the secret ingredient that makes Slurm so deliciously addictive."
2,3,2,FRY,"So, what's the secret ingredient?"
2,3,2,GLURMO,It's whatever your imagination wants it to be.
2,3,2,FRY,Oh. But what is it really?
2,3,2,GLURMO,"That's not for you to know. Now, over here the Grunka Lunkas are inducing Wumpus berries to release their flavour, using sensual massage."
2,3,2,BENDER,"Psst, those berries. Those are the secret ingredient, right?"
2,3,2,GLURMO,No.
2,3,2,BENDER,You positive?
2,3,2,GLURMO,Yes.
2,3,2,BENDER,I'm just asking cause they look kind of secret.
2,3,2,GLURMO,Enough! There will be no further questions.
2,3,2,FRY,Why?
2,3,2,LEELA,"Hey, look! The disgusting little men are starting to sing."
2,3,2,GRUNKA LUNKAS,"Grunka Lunka dunkity-do,"
2,3,2,,"We've got a friendly warning for you, Grunka Lunka dunkity-dasis, The secret of Slurm's on a need-to-know basis."
2,3,2,GRUNKA LUNKA #1,Asking questions in school is a great way to learn ...
2,3,2,GRUNKA LUNKA #2,... If you try that stuff here you might get your legs broke.
2,3,2,GRUNKA LUNKA #1,We once found a dead guy face down in the Slurm ...
2,3,2,GRUNKA LUNKA #2,... It could easily happen again to you folks.
2,3,2,GRUNKA LUNKAS,"So keep you head down, And keep your mouth shut, Grunka Lunka lunka dunkity dot!"
2,3,2,GLERMO,"Hey, I don't pay you to sing! You just used up today's bathroom break!"
2,3,2,GRUNKA LUNKA #2,Hard ass.
2,3,2,GLURMO,I heard that!
2,3,2,GLURMO,"Now on your right, you'll see the Slurm Master checking the Slurm for colour and bouquet."
2,3,2,FRY,So thirsty.
2,3,2,GLURMO,"Then he tastes it. He tastes it and tastes it, then tastes it some more."
2,3,2,FRY,"Uh, could I have some Slurm, please?"
2,3,2,GLURMO,No food or drink allowed on the tour. You'll have to wait until you're partying with Slurms MacKenzie.
2,3,2,FRY,When will that be?
2,3,2,GLURMO,Soon enough.
2,3,2,FRY,That's not soon enough.
2,3,2,LEELA,"Hey, what's behind that door?"
2,3,2,GLURMO,Nothing.
2,3,2,LEELA,Is it the secret ingredient?
2,3,2,GRUNKA LUNKAS,"Grunka Lunka dunkity dingredient,"
2,3,2,,You should not ask about the secret ingredient.
2,3,2,BENDER,
2,3,2,LEELA,I was just curious because of the armed guards.
2,3,2,GRUNKA LUNKAS,Grunka Lunka dunkity darmed guards--
2,3,2,BENDER,Shut the hell up!
2,3,2,HERMES,So you're telling me I could fire my whole staff and hire Grunka Lunkas at half the cost?
2,3,2,GLURMO,That's right. They think they have a good union but they don't. They're basically slaves.
2,3,2,LEELA,What are you doing?
2,3,2,FRY,I'm dying of thirst. Grab my feet and dunk my head in so I can drink.
2,3,2,LEELA,No. That's moronic.
2,3,2,FRY,Fine. I'll let go and swim around in the Slurm and drink as much as I want. Help! I can't swim!
2,3,2,LEELA,"Bender, why did you jump in?"
2,3,2,BENDER,Everybody was doing it. I just wanted to be popular.
2,3,3,BENDER,Ow!
2,3,3,LEELA,Where are we?
2,3,3,BENDER,And why is the Slurm pouring into this sewer?
2,3,3,FRY,This isn't Slurm at all!
2,3,3,LEELA,Something's rotten on the planet Wormulon. Look at this.
2,3,5,LEELA,This all must have something to do with the secret ingredient.
2,3,5,FRY,My God. What if the secret ingredient ... is people?
2,3,5,LEELA,No. There's already a soda like that: Soylent Cola.
2,3,5,FRY,Oh. How is it?
2,3,5,LEELA,It varies from person to person.
2,3,5,FARNSWORTH,Ooh!
2,3,5,ZOIDBERG,Do you have any that aren't so tight around the thorax?
2,3,5,GLURMO,"Yes, over in-- Say, weren't there more people in your group at the start of the tour?"
2,3,5,AMY,"Hey, yeah. Fry, Leela and Bender are missing."
2,3,5,GLURMO,If you'll excuse me.
2,3,5,LEELA,Quick.
2,3,5,FRY,"Look! Slurm! Finally! Oh, yeah! I'm never going 12 minutes without a Slurm again."
2,3,5,LEELA,It's the end of the line. This must be where they put in the secret ingredient.
2,3,5,FRY,"Well, whatever it is, it's even better fresh. Mmm, still warm."
2,3,6,FRY,Ew!
2,3,6,LEELA,Blech!
2,3,6,BENDER,"Oh, Lordy!"
2,3,6,LEELA,Fry! Fry!
2,3,6,FRY,That's the secret ingredient of Slurm?
2,3,6,LEELA,That's the only ingredient of Slurm.
2,3,6,FRY,Ew!
2,3,7,BENDER,"I'll save us! Oh, that feels good!"
2,3,7,FRY,"Thanks, Bender!"
2,3,7,LEELA,The exit! We made it.
2,3,8,BENDER,"Uh, your majesty, I brought the prisoners."
2,3,8,GLURMO,"Well, my curious friends, you learned the secret of Slurm. That concludes the portion of the tour where you stay alive."
2,3,8,LEELA,"You wish, you slimy worm! Heyya!"
2,3,8,SLURM QUEEN,"Good work, Glurmo. You have pleased your queen."
2,3,8,SMALL GLURMO #2,"Thank you, your majesty."
2,3,8,SMALL GLURMO #1,"Thanks, ma'am."
2,3,8,LEELA,How can you trick people into drinking something that comes out of your behind? It's disgusting.
2,3,8,SLURM QUEEN,Is it? Honey comes from a bee's behind. Milk comes from a cow's behind. And have you ever used toothpaste?
2,3,8,FRY,Who's behind does that come from?
2,3,8,SLURM QUEEN,You don't wanna know.
2,3,8,BENDER,"Look, we just came to party with Slurms MacKenzie. By the way, when is that scheduled?"
2,3,8,SLURM QUEEN,Never! To the torture cave!
2,3,8,SLURM QUEEN,"You, my metal friend, will have the honour of becoming 174 Slurm cans."
2,3,8,BENDER,"Ah, this trip is turning into a big letdown."
2,3,8,SLURM QUEEN,"As for you, you will be submerged in Royal Slurm which, in a matter of minutes, will transform you into a Slurm Queen like myself."
2,3,8,SMALL GLURMO #1,"But, your highness, she's a commoner. Her Slurm will taste foul."
2,3,8,SLURM QUEEN,"Yes! Which is why we'll market it as New Slurm. Then, when everyone hates it, we'll bring back Slurm Classic, and make billions!"
2,3,8,FRY,What about me?
2,3,8,SLURM QUEEN,You are free to go ...
2,3,8,FRY,Yes!
2,3,8,SLURM QUEEN,"... if you can resist this concentrated super Slurm! It's so delicious, you'll eat until you explode! Oh, which reminds me, put a tarp over that sofa, will you? Bon appétit!"
2,3,8,FRY,Mmm!
2,3,8,SLURM QUEEN,"Farewell! Oh, and congratulations again on winning the contest."
2,3,8,LEELA,"Fry, untie us, quick!"
2,3,8,FRY,Here I come. Let me just-- One more taste.
2,3,8,LEELA,You pig. Stop stuffing your craw and save us.
2,3,8,BENDER,I can't see what's happening. Are we boned?
2,3,8,LEELA,"Yeah, we're boned."
2,3,8,FRY,I can't stop eating this delicious ooze. But I'm not gonna let you die.
2,3,8,LEELA,Hurry!
2,3,8,BENDER,What's happening? Just in time!
2,3,8,FRY,Nooo! I could fit if I didn't have these damn arms!
2,3,8,LEELA,We're close to the exit. I can smell those filthy orange guys.
2,3,8,SLURMS,Stop right there!
2,3,8,BENDER,Slurms MacKenzie?
2,3,8,SLURMS,Shh! I want you to take me with you.
2,3,8,FRY,Say what?
2,3,8,SLURMS,I'm partied out. All I want is to stay home and rent videos and watch them with a few friends. Is that so much to ask?
2,3,8,BENDER,Forget it pal. It says on this bottle-cap you have to party with us.
2,3,8,SLURMS,"Alright, when we get to Earth. But please don't invite too many people, I wanna keep it small."
2,3,8,BENDER,"No can do, Slurms!"
2,3,8,SLURMS,This way!
2,3,8,LEELA,She's gaining on us.
2,3,8,SLURMS,"Go on without me, I'll hold her off."
2,3,8,FRY,But she'll crush you like a worm ... crushing a smaller worm.
2,3,8,SLURMS,It's alright. I'm so tired of partying. So very tired. I'll save you the only way I know how: By partying! Babes.
2,3,8,DIXIE,"Yes, Mr. MacKenzie?"
2,3,8,SLURMS,"You've served me well these 40 years, but this time I've got to party alone."
2,3,8,BABE,But--
2,3,8,SLURMS,There'll be other parties for you. Now go. Go!
2,3,8,BENDER,"Party on, Slurms!"
2,3,8,SLURMS,"Party on, contest winners. Party on."
2,3,8,SLURM QUEEN,No! We're ruined! They know our disgusting secret!
2,3,9,FARNSWORTH,"Commissioner, my crew has made a horrific discovery: It seems that Slurm is produced in a colossal worm hiney!"
2,3,9,COMMISSIONER,"Hmm, ""hiney"", you say? Why, with your testimony we'll finally be able to outlaw this insidious Slurm."
2,3,9,FRY,"Outlaw Slurm? Uh, don't pay any attention to him sir ..."
2,3,10,FRY,... Grandpa's making up crazy stories again.
2,3,10,FARNSWORTH,"I'm not your grandpa, you're my uncle! From the year 2000!"
2,3,11,COMMISSIONER,
2,3,11,FRY,"Ah, I just wish Slurms MacKenzie were here to enjoy this with me."
2,3,11,BENDER,"Yeah, that Slurms sure loved to party. Whattya say we all party one last time for him?"
2,3,11,LEELA,For Slurms!
2,3,11,AMY,For Slurms!
2,3,11,BENDER,For Slurms!
2,3,11,FARNSWORTH,For Slurms!
2,3,11,FRY,For Slurms!
2,3,11,ZOIDBERG,Whammy-wazzle!
2,3,11,BENDER,"Hey, that's not that bad."
2,3,11,FRY,Mmm!
