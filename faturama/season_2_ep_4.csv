2,4,0,"""I SECOND THAT EMOTION""","By Patric M. Verrone Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
2,4,0,ANNOUNCER,Futurama is brought to you by ... ... Glagnar's Human Rinds. It's a buncha muncha cruncha human!
2,4,2,LEELA,Aww! Somebody likes snouts.
2,4,2,FRY,Is it me?
2,4,2,BENDER,"Ow, my head! My precious head! Stupid can opener. You killed my father and now you've come back for me!"
2,4,2,FRY,"You alright, Bender?"
2,4,2,BENDER,"Yeah, I guess so. But I don't see why we keep this ticking time-bomb around just for that dumb animal."
2,4,2,LEELA,"Don't yell at Nibbler like that. You hurt his feelings. Come on, pet him and make up."
2,4,2,BENDER,No.
2,4,2,LEELA,I said pet him.
2,4,2,BENDER,I'll pet him. I'll pet him with both hands! Ow! My ass! Get off!
2,4,2,LEELA,Are you alright?
2,4,2,BENDER,"Ah, it's nothing a lawsuit won't cure."
2,4,2,LEELA,"Not you. Aww, poor baby chipped a fang."
2,4,2,BENDER,"Hey, I got a busted ass here, I don't see anyone kissing it."
2,4,3,ZOIDBERG,"Alright, I'm coming."
2,4,3,JEFFERY,"Remember, Rover gets the pill and Pepper gets the suppository. Next."
2,4,3,JEFFERY,"It's just a simple broken fang, nothing serious."
2,4,3,BENDER,"What's that you say there, doctor? You're gonna have to put him down?"
2,4,3,JEFFERY,No-- what? Huh?
2,4,3,BENDER,Terrible shame that. Shall I do the honours?
2,4,3,LEELA,No!
2,4,3,BENDER,You about done?
2,4,3,LEELA,Next time I'm keeping it.
2,4,3,JEFFERY,
2,4,3,FRY,"Hey, what are these rings in Nibbler's fang?"
2,4,3,JEFFERY,"Um, I'm still a little woozy from a gazelle kick this morning but if he's anything like the common tree, the rings might indicate his age."
2,4,3,FRY,"Yeah, well, good luck. It'd take some kind of genius to count all those rings."
2,4,3,JEFFERY,He's five.
2,4,3,FARNSWORTH,"Happy birthday, young Nibbler."
2,4,3,LEELA,"Aww, look how cuddly he looks in his new cape!"
2,4,3,BENDER,I'd be cuddly too if someone gave me a new cape.
2,4,3,FRY,Who's playing pin the tail on the moon maggot?
2,4,3,BENDER,"Ooh, me! Everyone watch how good I am. And the crowd goes wild! What prize do I get? Cash?"
2,4,3,AMY,"Hey, look at Nibbler!"
2,4,3,HERMES,"Aww, he's holding a spoon."
2,4,3,ZOIDBERG,He's so talented!
2,4,3,BENDER,You call that talent? Gather round old Bender and get ready for the show of a lifetime. Ta-da!
2,4,3,HERMES,Now he's wearing a hat!
2,4,3,LEELA,"Come on, let's all sing Happy Birthday!"
2,4,3,ALL,"What day is today? It's Nibbler's birthday, What a day for a birthday, Let's all have some cake."
2,4,3,FRY,... and you smell like one too!
2,4,3,BENDER,"Hey, what about this?"
2,4,3,LEELA,"Bender, I thought you were supposed to be cooking for this party."
2,4,3,BENDER,"Fine, we'll have rack of Nibbler."
2,4,3,LEELA,"Just make a simple cake. And this time, if someone's going to jump out of it, make sure you put them in after you cook it."
2,4,3,BENDER,"So it's a cake you want, is it? I'll make you a cake you'll never forget."
2,4,3,BENDER,"That'll take care of those annoying rats. Now, to bake a cake so delicious they'll have no choice but to love and worship me."
2,4,3,BENDER,There! This'll teach those filthy bastards who's lovable. Now all I have to do is spell check it and it's ready for my admiring public. No! Get away from there! That's it.
2,4,3,BENDER,Happy birthday!
2,4,3,LEELA,"Bender, what's going-- No!"
2,4,3,BENDER,Hey! Can't you see I'm using the toilet?
2,4,3,AMY,Bender! How could you flush Nibbler down the toilet?
2,4,3,BENDER,"Well, step one, I had to lift the seat. That was the first little annoyance. Am I right, men?"
2,4,3,LEELA,Aren't you upset at all? How would you feel if I flushed Fry down the toilet?
2,4,3,BENDER,Only one way to find out.
2,4,3,LEELA,You have no sympathy for anyone else's feelings.
2,4,3,BENDER,Of course I do. Right now I feel sorry for you.
2,4,3,LEELA,You do?
2,4,3,BENDER,"Yeah. I mean, one cantaloupe-sized bloodshot eye? You ain't winning no beauty pageants, lady."
2,4,3,FARNSWORTH,"And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I too hope one day to go: The toilet."
2,4,3,LEELA,I wouldn't feel so bad if Bender just understood the pain he caused me.
2,4,4,CALCULON,"Give it to me straight, doctor -- don't sugarcoat it."
2,4,4,DOCTORBOT,Very well. Your entire family died when a plane piloted by your fianc√©e crashed into your uninsured home. And you have inoperable cancer.
2,4,4,BENDER,"Bet you weren't expecting that one, Calculon!"
2,4,5,AMY,It's like he doesn't understand simple humanoid emotion.
2,4,5,LEELA,I wish just once Bender could feel exactly what I feel.
2,4,5,FARNSWORTH,"Actually, through the miracle of science, that can be arranged."
2,4,5,FRY,Uh-oh. Is this gonna be another crazy experiment that crosses a line Man was not meant to cross?
2,4,6,LINDA,The official death toll in that tragic rocket crash has now been raised to
2,4,6,BENDER,"Hey, what the hell are you doing with my head?"
2,4,6,FARNSWORTH,I need to tinker in it.
2,4,6,BENDER,Why don't you just use a potted plant like Fry?
2,4,6,FARNSWORTH,"Quiet, you. I'm installing an empathy chip."
2,4,6,FRY,And that'll allow Bender to feel other people's emotions?
2,4,6,FARNSWORTH,"Yes. If by ""allow"" you mean ""force""."
2,4,6,BENDER,Ooh! Ow! Son of a-- Careful with that! Ow ...
2,4,6,FARNSWORTH,"Oh dear, oh my. I got it. Once more."
2,4,6,BENDER,... Ow! Professor!
2,4,6,FARNSWORTH,Steady now.
2,4,6,BENDER,Ow!
2,4,6,FARNSWORTH,There we go. Now I'll simply tune it to Leela's emotional frequency.
2,4,6,BENDER,"My God, I'm overcome with ... feelings. I'm experiencing a powerful yearning to ... to cram my gullet full of mackerel heads."
2,4,6,ZOIDBERG,"That's me, baby!"
2,4,6,FARNSWORTH,Hmm.
2,4,6,BENDER,"Now I'm worried that I'm not as smart as Leela, but at the same time I feel relieved that I'm cuter than her."
2,4,6,AMY,Uh ... that's me.
2,4,6,FRY,Thanks for covering.
2,4,6,BENDER,This time I miss Nibbler and I'm feeling nosy and opinionated.
2,4,6,AMY,Bingo!
2,4,6,HERMES,That's Leela!
2,4,6,LEELA,"Thank you, Professor. I'm happy that Bender can finally feel my pain."
2,4,6,BENDER,Happy. I like this feeling. Just don't revert to your usual mopey self.
2,4,6,LEELA,I'm not mopey. You shut up!
2,4,6,BENDER,"Anger, huh? How dare you make me feel anger, you one-eyed jerk with a dead pet!"
2,4,6,LEELA,"Thanks for taking me out, Amy. I feel slightly less miserable already."
2,4,6,AMY,"Hey, you know what'd cheer you up? You should get a puppy."
2,4,6,LEELA,A puppy? Nibbler loved to eat puppies.
2,4,6,FRY,What's your problem?
2,4,6,BENDER,I miss Nibbler.
2,4,6,FRY,You do?
2,4,6,BENDER,"Hell, no! It's Leela's stupid feelings. Why can't she just drink herself happy like a normal person?"
2,4,6,BENDER,"Uh-oh, jealousy. You think you're so hot!"
2,4,6,FRY,What?
2,4,6,BENDER,The only reason you get all the guys is because you dress like a tramp!
2,4,6,FRY,They're just responding to my personality.
2,4,6,AMY,"Um, Leela? Armando and I are going to the back seat of his car for coffee. You gonna be alright here by yourself?"
2,4,6,LEELA,Sure. I'm having a great time -- really. You two go enjoy yourselves.
2,4,6,BENDER,I'm so lonely. I'm gonna go eat a bucket of ice cream. A bucket of ...
2,4,6,FRY,The spoon's in the foot powder.
2,4,6,BENDER,"I'm at the end of my rope. I can't live another minute without poor, sweet Nibbler."
2,4,6,FRY,"Too bad he wasn't an alligator. Y'know, when you flush those things they stay alive in the sewers."
2,4,6,BENDER,Really?
2,4,6,FRY,Yep. My friend's cousin's caseworker saw one once. It's a widely-believed fact.
2,4,6,BENDER,"Hmm, sewers. Thinking, thinking, thinking."
2,4,6,BENDER,"Hang on, Nibbler. Uncle Bender's coming to save you. Damn, it's too small. What did those human design this for anyway? Aha! Bender, one; toilet, zero! See you on the other side!"
2,4,7,FRY,Bender? Bender?!
2,4,8,FRY,Have you seen my sombrero?
2,4,8,LEELA,Now he's flushed himself down the toilet? Who's he gonna flush next?
2,4,8,FRY,"Hey, it's your fault. He only flushed himself because your emotions made him feel bad."
2,4,8,LEELA,You're right. I feel terrible.
2,4,8,FRY,"Oh, great, now you're making him feel worse!"
2,4,8,LEELA,I guess we'd better go down into the sewers and look for him.
2,4,8,AMY,Are you crazy? There's mutants down there! They'll eat you alive.
2,4,8,ZOIDBERG,They're hideous!
2,4,8,LEELA,There's no such thing as mutants. That's a ridiculous urban myth.
2,4,8,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, don't be so sure. Many scientists believe humans really could mutate down there. Uh, due to exposure to toxic waste and radioactive runoff and good old American faeces."
2,4,8,FRY,God bless America.
2,4,8,FRY,"Phew! Uh, ladies first."
2,4,9,FRY,"Oh, and the aftertaste!"
2,4,9,LEELA,What is it?
2,4,9,FRY,I burned my finger.
2,4,9,LEELA,
2,4,9,FRY,"Looks like we're under Park Avenue. Ooh, ritzy! Just think: All this was probably once a charity luncheon for the Met."
2,4,9,LEELA,"Wait, what's that?"
2,4,9,BENDER,I never should have thrown out the manual.
2,4,9,LEELA,"Bender, you didn't have to come down here."
2,4,9,BENDER,I know. But I just missed Nibbler so much.
2,4,9,LEELA,He was so cute.
2,4,9,BENDER,He was so sweet.
2,4,9,FRY,Eck! This emotional display is making me nauseous. Or maybe it's whatever that is.
2,4,9,LEELA,Nibbler?
2,4,9,BENDER,Nibbler?
2,4,9,LEELA,"It's no use. We'd better turn back. Which way, Fry?"
2,4,9,FRY,"Hmm. According to this map, the only way out is through ... that pipe. Don't worry. It gets wider after about a mile."
2,4,9,LEELA,Idiot.
2,4,9,BENDER,Idiot.
2,4,9,FRY,
2,4,9,LEELA,Mutants!
2,4,9,LEELA,Mutants! They're real!
2,4,9,FRY,I'll take care of this! Back! Back!
2,4,9,VYOLET,"Thanks, handsome."
2,4,9,DWAYNE,"Please, do not be frightened, we're harmless."
2,4,9,RAOUL,I have three arms.
2,4,9,DWAYNE,"I said ""harmless"" not ""armless""."
2,4,9,VYOLET,Lay off him. You know he's only got one ear.
2,4,9,FRY,"Hey, aren't you supposed to be eating our brains? You're mutants."
2,4,9,DWAYNE,Mutants? Perhaps it is you who are the mutants.
2,4,9,VYOLET,"Please, Dwayne, have you looked in a mirror lately?"
2,4,9,RAOUL,"Welcome to our village. It may not be Paris but it has a certain quaint charm that I, for one, wouldn't trade for the world."
2,4,9,BENDER,"You guys realise you live in a sewer, right?"
2,4,9,DWAYNE,Perhaps. But perhaps your civilisation is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you.
2,4,9,LEELA,"No, we're on the top."
2,4,9,FRY,Daylight and everything.
2,4,9,VYOLET,It must be wonderful.
2,4,9,BENDER,Eh.
2,4,9,LEELA,"Listen. We actually came down here to find our pet, Nibbler. He got flushed down the toilet."
2,4,9,RAOUL,Well if he got flushed down the toilet he probably came through here. Everything always does. Follow me. All that is ours was once flushed down your toilets. Over there is our aquarium. This is our library.
2,4,9,BENDER,Nothing but crumpled porno and Ayn Rand.
2,4,9,RAOUL,And over here is our church.
2,4,10,FRY,Wow. You guys worship an unexploded nuclear bomb?
2,4,11,VYOLET,"Yeah, but nobody's that observant. It's mainly a Christmas and Easter thing."
2,4,11,LEELA,Nibbler?
2,4,11,BENDER,"Come to Daddy, sweetie-ookums."
2,4,11,FRY,"So, is it true that alligators flushed down the toilet survive down here?"
2,4,11,VYOLET,No. That's just an urban legend.
2,4,11,BENDER,Then what are those?
2,4,11,VYOLET,Crocodiles.
2,4,11,RAOUL,"We keep them as pets. Then, when they grow too large, we flush them down into the sub-sewer."
2,4,11,DWAYNE,Some say there's a freakish race of sub-mutants down there.
2,4,11,VYOLET,"Please, that's just a sub-urban legend."
2,4,11,DWAYNE,Oh? Then I suppose you also don't believe in ... ... El Chupanibre.
2,4,11,LEELA,El Chupanibre? What's that?
2,4,11,DWAYNE,"Gather round, children, for the legend of El Chupanibre."
2,4,11,VYOLET,Crocodile.
2,4,11,DWAYNE,Whatever.
2,4,11,LEELA,Wait. Our pet Nibbler loves fresh crocodile. It's his favourite treat. He must be El Chupanibre.
2,4,11,BENDER,"Hey, yeah!"
2,4,11,RAOUL,You unleashed the dreaded El Chupanibre upon us? Then you are our sworn enemies.
2,4,11,LEELA,You don't understand. He would never hurt people. Let us help you capture him.
2,4,11,DWAYNE,"Impossible. If the legend is true, our only hope is to offer him a snack-rifice."
2,4,11,RAOUL,Yes. An unspoiled virgin.
2,4,11,LEELA,I volunteer.
2,4,11,VYOLET,"Nice try, Leela, but we've all seen Zapp Brannigan's webpage."
2,4,11,BENDER,"Oh, I made myself feel bad."
2,4,11,RAOUL,"She'll have to do. Chain her to the post! And rip her shirt a little. Behold. When El Chupanibre comes for the, uh, ""virgin"", he will be snared by this rope trap."
2,4,11,DWAYNE,Shh. El Chupanibre comes soon. It is nightfall.
2,4,11,LEELA,Nightfall? How can you tell down here?
2,4,11,DWAYNE,The tide is coming in.
2,4,11,VYLOET,"Quiet, the beast approaches."
2,4,11,BENDER,"Nibbler! Aw, come here precious! Look everyone, it's El Chupanibre."
2,4,11,DWAYNE,That's not El Chupanibre.
2,4,11,BENDER,Say what?
2,4,11,DWAYNE,That's El Chupanibre.
2,4,11,FRY,I'll take care of this.
2,4,11,LEELA,"Bender, do something."
2,4,11,BENDER,I'm too scared.
2,4,11,FRY,"Leela, your scaredness is being transmitted straight to Bender. If you care about Nibbler, stop caring about him!"
2,4,11,LEELA,I can't. I love every living creature.
2,4,11,FRY,Even me?
2,4,11,LEELA,As a friend.
2,4,11,FRY,Damn.
2,4,11,BENDER,"Listen to me, Leela: I'm an expert at not caring. The secret is to stop giving a rat's ass about anyone else and start thinking of the things that you want, that you deserve, that the world owes you."
2,4,11,LEELA,"Well, I could use a new tank top."
2,4,11,BENDER,Bigger! Bigger!
2,4,11,LEELA,A fashionable tank top. And designer boots ... encrusted with jewels.
2,4,11,BENDER,"Don't stop now, you'll need some pants to go with that outfit."
2,4,11,LEELA,Yeah. And I could afford it all if I didn't have to feed that stupid Nibbler.
2,4,11,BENDER,"Bender is back. I'll save you, Nibbler."
2,4,11,FRY,Bender's gonna be killed!
2,4,11,LEELA,You know what else I could use? A weekend at one of those fancy spas. And a Toblerone.
2,4,11,FRY,Yeah!
2,4,11,LEELA,You did it!
2,4,11,RAOUL,Let's have a tissue-tape parade!
2,4,11,BENDER,No thanks.
2,4,11,DWAYNE,"Gather round, children, to hear the legend of Bender."
2,4,11,FARNSWORTH,That was a disgusting story.
2,4,11,LEELA,"And it's all thanks to Bender. I love you, Bender."
2,4,11,BENDER,I love you too. Get that stupid chip out of me before I kill myself!
2,4,11,FARNSWORTH,"Bender, you won't believe this, but the empathy chip burned out. The emotion you felt for Nibbler was actually your own."
2,4,11,FRY,Looks like Bender learned an important lesson about respecting other people's feelings afterall.
2,4,11,FARNSWORTH,"No, I'm wrong. The empathy chip was running at triple capacity."
2,4,11,BENDER,"And I still barely felt anything. Goodnight, losers!"
2,4,11,LEELA,"You know, Bender may not have learned anything from me, but I think I actually learned something from him. So long, jerkwads!"
2,4,11,FARNSWORTH,So long!
