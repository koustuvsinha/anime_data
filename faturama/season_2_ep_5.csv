2,5,0,"""BRANNIGAN, BEGIN AGAIN""","By Lewis Morton Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
2,5,0,FRY,Hmm. Horsey to pointy guy six. Check.
2,5,0,BENDER,"Hmm. Get him, boys!"
2,5,0,FRY,Good move.
2,5,0,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, everyone. We have a mission to further the noble cause of intergalactic peace."
2,5,0,BENDER,Nope. Watching cartoons.
2,5,0,FRY,Sorry.
2,5,0,LEELA,What's the mission?
2,5,0,FARNSWORTH,It's a delivery for the Democratic Order Of Planets.
2,5,0,FRY,
2,5,0,FARNSWORTH,"It's similar to the United Nations from your time, Fry."
2,5,0,FRY,Uh...
2,5,0,HERMES,Or like the Federation from your Star Trek programme.
2,5,0,FRY,Oh!
2,5,0,FARNSWORTH,Tonight is the ribbon-cutting for the DOOP's new headquarters.
2,5,0,LEELA,What are we delivering?
2,5,0,FARNSWORTH,Something without which no ribbon-cutting ceremony could proceed. The ceremonial oversized scissors.
2,5,0,LEELA,We'll get them there as quickly as we can.
2,5,0,FARNSWORTH,"Alright, but don't run with them."
2,5,0,FRY,"Wow! There's a million aliens. I've never seen anything so mind blowing. Ooh, a reception table with muffins!"
2,5,0,GLAB,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the DOOP's magnificent new headquarters. A fitting home for an organisation that has fostered peace throughout the universe. Even between the Insectoids and the Space Lizards."
2,5,0,FRY,"So, what's it like on planet Amazonia?"
2,5,0,AMAZONIAN,Big rats there. Me crush with club.
2,5,0,FRY,That's so interesting. Maybe we could get to know each other over a coffee.
2,5,0,GLAB,"I can think of no better place for this centre of diplomacy than here in orbit around the Neutral Planet. What are your thoughts on this momentous occasion, Your Neutralness?"
2,5,0,NEUTRAL PRESIDENT,I have no strong feelings one way or the other.
2,5,0,ZAPP,"I hate these filthy Neutrals, Kif. With enemies you know where they stand but with Neutrals, who knows? It sickens me. Halt. Why, Leela. I do believe we've met."
2,5,0,BENDER,He means you guys did it.
2,5,0,LEELA,"If you don't mind, we're here to deliver the scissors for the ribbon-cutting."
2,5,0,ZAPP,Then you're under arrest.
2,5,0,LEELA,What for?
2,5,0,ZAPP,How do I know these scissors aren't part of some Neutral plot?
2,5,0,LEELA,But they're not even sharp. Who could I possibly hurt with them?
2,5,0,ZAPP,"The Yarn People of Nylar 4? So, a plan to assassinate a weird-looking alien with scissors. How very Neutral of you."
2,5,0,LEELA,What?
2,5,0,ZAPP,"It was almost the perfect crime, but you forgot one thing: Rock crushes scissors ... but paper covers rock ... and scissors cut paper. Kif, we have a conundrum. Search them for paper, and bring me a rock."
2,5,0,KIF,Why?
2,5,0,ZAPP,"So beautiful, yet so neutral. Drag them to the ship."
2,5,0,GLAB,"And now, to cut the ribbon, the legendary DOOP captain who just returned from a triumphant carpet-bombing of Eden 7, Zapp Brannigan."
2,5,0,ZAPP,What makes a man turn neutral? Lust for gold? Power? Or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality?
2,5,0,KIF,"Um, sir, you're supposed to be cutting the ribbon right now."
2,5,0,ZAPP,No matter. I'll simply cut it from here with the ships laser.
2,5,0,KIF,"Sir, I don't think that's wise."
2,5,0,ZAPP,"Kif, if there's one thing I don't need it's your I-don't-think-that's-wise attitude."
2,5,2,ZAPP,Whoopsie-daisy.
2,5,2,GLAB,"Zapp Brannigan, you stand accused of blowing up DOOP headquarters. How do you plead?"
2,5,2,ZAPP,Absolutely 99% not guilty.
2,5,2,GLAB,Then the prosecutor will call his first witness.
2,5,2,HYPER-CHICKEN,"Your Honour, I'm just a simple Hyper-Chicken from a backwoods asteroid but if it please the court I reckon I'll call the entire jury."
2,5,2,GLAB,I'm going to allow this.
2,5,2,HYPER-CHICKEN,Members of the jury ... ... did y'all happen to catch a gander at who blew up that there DOOP headquarters?
2,5,2,JUROR #1,"That's the guy, right there."
2,5,2,JUROR #2,"Oh, yeah, right there."
2,5,2,SMALL GLURMO #1,That one.
2,5,2,HYPER-CHICKEN,And are y'all gonna vote to convict him?
2,5,2,NEPTUNIAN,You'd better believe it.
2,5,2,JUROR #1,You bet.
2,5,2,GLAB,The jury is instructed to disregard its own testimony.
2,5,2,HYPER-CHICKEN,"Your Honour, the prosecution rests."
2,5,2,GLAB,"The evidence against Zapp Brannigan is strong. However, in light of his years of service, and the incompetence of this hillbilly prosecutor, I'm afraid I must dismiss all charges."
2,5,2,LEELA,"Dismiss all charges? Your Honour, I know the case is closed and you've rendered your verdict, but I wanna testify."
2,5,2,GLAB,I'm going to allow this.
2,5,2,HYPER-CHICKEN,"Now, Miss Leela, on the date in question, were you or were you not wearing a hoop skirt?"
2,5,2,LEELA,"That's a stupid question. What matters is Zapp Brannigan is the sorriest captain I've ever seen, and I saw the idiot blow up DOOP headquarters with my own eye."
2,5,2,ZAPP,I'd like to cross-examine the witness.
2,5,2,GLAB,I'm going to allow this.
2,5,2,ZAPP,We've met before have we not?
2,5,2,LEELA,Yes.
2,5,2,ZAPP,"And on that occasion, did you have sex with someone? May I remind you you are still under oath."
2,5,2,LEELA,Yes.
2,5,2,ZAPP,Please point out the person in this courtroom you had sex with. And his name is?
2,5,2,LEELA,Zapp Brannigan.
2,5,2,ZAPP,The very same Zapp Brannigan who did not blow up DOOP headquarters. I rest my case.
2,5,2,GLAB,"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you may begin your deliberations."
2,5,2,SMALL GLURMO #1,"Your Honour, we have reached a verdict. We find the defendant ... guilty."
2,5,2,GLAB,"Zapp Brannigan, you are hereby stripped of your rank as captain and dismissed from the DOOP."
2,5,2,ZAPP,"I'd like to make one final statement. Kif c'mere and hold up the flag. And wave it a little for God's sakes. My friends, you can take away a man's title and his uniform but you can never take away his integrity or his honour. Plus it was mostly Kif's fault."
2,5,2,KIF,What?
2,5,2,GLAB,"Kif Kroker, you are also stripped of your rank and dishonourably discharged."
2,5,2,ZAPP,"One day a man has everything, the next day he blows up a $400 billion space station and the next day he has nothing. It makes you think."
2,5,2,KIF,"No, it doesn't."
2,5,2,ZAPP,"Come, Kif, it's time to begin our life as civilians. That's an order, soldier."
2,5,2,FRY,"Hey, Bender?"
2,5,2,BENDER,Yeah?
2,5,2,LEELA,"Alright, this is the third hose fight I've broken up today and the second one using actual hoses. Now move your lazy asses and start scrubbing the ship like I ordered you to."
2,5,2,FRY,"You don't have to get so mad, Leela."
2,5,2,BENDER,"Yeah, Fry already wiped off some of the dirt with his finger."
2,5,3,LEELA,Zapp?
2,5,3,ZAPP,"Leela, I didn't know where else to turn. You're the only woman who ever loved me."
2,5,3,LEELA,I never loved you.
2,5,3,ZAPP,I mean physically.
2,5,3,LEELA,What do you want?
2,5,3,ZAPP,"Just let me work for a little food. Perhaps I could paint a fence, or service you sexually, or mop the floors."
2,5,3,LEELA,You don't know how to do any of those things.
2,5,3,ZAPP,Kif might.
2,5,3,FARNSWORTH,"Leela, who are you talking to?"
2,5,3,ZAPP,Just a broken-down hobo who's hit rock-bottom. And his commanding officer.
2,5,3,FARNSWORTH,"Why, you're that disgraced starship captain. Having him on staff will distract people from our horrendous safety record. Come in."
2,5,3,FARNSWORTH,I'd like everyone to meet our new employees. Which ones are new?
2,5,3,HERMES,The green dude and the fat man.
2,5,3,FARNSWORTH,"Hmm, I could swear I've never seen that robot before either."
2,5,3,BENDER,I'm Bender. You know? The lovable rascal.
2,5,3,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, yes, yes. My good friend, of course. Anyway, whoever you all are, I have good news. You'll be making a delivery to Stumbos 4, a planet with such high gravity you'll most likely be crushed under the weight of your own hair. Enjoy."
2,5,4,ZAPP,"So, this Leela. I know she's a very sensuous woman but what manner of captain is she?"
2,5,4,FRY,She's really strict.
2,5,4,BENDER,And mean.
2,5,4,ZAPP,I see. Does she by any chance give the crewmembers spankings?
2,5,4,FRY,"No, she just makes us do work and stuff."
2,5,4,ZAPP,"Good, good. But should she ever institute some sort of bare-bottom spanking policy let me go in your place. I won't have my comrades harmed."
2,5,4,BENDER,"Hey, this guy's alright!"
2,5,4,ZAPP,"Here's to us poor schmoes working for the man. Even if he is a hot, sexy, female man."
2,5,5,KIF,"I've computed out landing co-ordinates, Captain."
2,5,5,LEELA,"Thanks, Kif. Very nice work."
2,5,5,KIF,"Wait, what?"
2,5,5,LEELA,"I said ""very nice work""."
2,5,5,KIF,This is the happiest day of my life.
2,5,6,LEELA,
2,5,6,BENDER,They're not very heavy but you don't hear me not complaining.
2,5,6,LEELA,They're not heavy in here because we have an anti-grav pump. But once you get out on the surface the gravity will be very intense.
2,5,6,FRY,"Hey, no prob', this lead apron'll protect me."
2,5,6,LEELA,I don't want any screw-ups. Use the hover-dolly and just deliver one pillow at a time.
2,5,6,BENDER,"Hey, here's an idea, let's deliver all the pillows at once."
2,5,6,FRY,Yeah!
2,5,6,ZAPP,That's using the old noodle!
2,5,6,ZAPP,"Come on, girdle. Hold!"
2,5,6,BENDER,Uh-oh.
2,5,6,LEELA,What the hell happened?
2,5,6,BENDER,"Some breaking occured, the dolly was involved, that's about all we know."
2,5,6,LEELA,I told you dumb apes not to overload it. Each of those pillows weighs 150lbs here.
2,5,6,FRY,"Alright, don't get your panties in a knot. We'll just use the back-up dolly."
2,5,6,BENDER,I'll start loading up the pillows.
2,5,6,LEELA,"No way, Jack. You disobeyed an order, so now you have to deliver all 40 pillows by hand."
2,5,6,ZAPP,"Let me ask you a serious question, Leela: Does the company that made your bra make a girdle as well? I ask because a friend of mine--"
2,5,6,LEELA,Just get to work.
2,5,6,BENDER,"I'm Leela, get to work, neh neh neh."
2,5,6,FRY,I agree.
2,5,6,KIF,"The point is, it's just so humiliating working for that man. Once, he actually ordered me to ... shave his armpits while he was in the bathtub. So, I said--"
2,5,6,LEELA,"Y'know, why don't we talk about something besides Zapp for a while?"
2,5,6,KIF,"Oh, alright. Um ... well ... how 'bout then, um...OK, well, there he was in the tub, alright?"
2,5,6,FRY,"Ah, some good old high-gravity rain. That'll cool us off."
2,5,6,BENDER,This is all Leela's fault.
2,5,6,FRY,"Yeah. If she had let us use the back-up dolly, we could have broken it, given up and gone home by now."
2,5,6,ZAPP,"Y'know boys, a good captain needs many skills, such as boldness, daring and a velour uniform. And I'm not convinced Leela has any of those things."
2,5,6,FRY,"Ah, Leela's not that bad. I just wish she didn't make us work so much."
2,5,6,ZAPP,"Back when I was captain all I asked from my men was their complete loyalty. If I had that, then for all I cared they could sit around the whole day drinking beer in their underpants."
2,5,6,BENDER,Beer?
2,5,6,FRY,Underpants?
2,5,6,KIF,"But now, Zapp's not captain anymore. I'm free! Oh, you hear that? I'm actually laughing!"
2,5,6,FRY,This is a mutiny.
2,5,6,BENDER,"You're outta here, lady. Zapp's the new captain."
2,5,6,FRY,All hail the new captain.
2,5,7,ZAPP,"Leela, you might be a formidible do-er of the nasty but I am forced to relieve you of your post."
2,5,7,LEELA,"On what grounds, you slobbering oaf?"
2,5,7,ZAPP,Failure to prevent a mutiny. Throw her in the brig.
2,5,7,FRY,We don't have a brig.
2,5,7,ZAPP,"Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as ""the brig""."
2,5,7,LEELA,You really don't want me to be captain anymore?
2,5,7,BENDER,"You got it, genius."
2,5,7,LEELA,"But, didn't I do a good job?"
2,5,7,FRY,You were mean and you yelled and you made us do all that work.
2,5,7,LEELA,"Sometimes a captain needs to do those things. Besides I, I thought we were friends."
2,5,7,FRY,"Yeah, well, you shouldn't have been such a mean captain then."
2,5,7,BENDER,"Don't worry, Leela, soon we'll be able to look back on this and laugh."
2,5,8,ZAPP,"Back in my old uniform, and it nearly still fits. Even after all that fattening hobo cuisine."
2,5,8,KIF,"What shall I do with your civilian clothes, sir?"
2,5,8,ZAPP,"Take them to the laundry-brig. So, do I have your loyalty, men?"
2,5,8,BENDER,To the ends of the universe.
2,5,8,FRY,Ten hundred percent!
2,5,8,ZAPP,That's not nearly loyal enough. I order you to sit around and drink beer until you're as loyal as Kif here.
2,5,8,BENDER,"Yes, sir, sir!"
2,5,8,KIF,"Um, may I have a beer, sir?"
2,5,8,ZAPP,"No. You're loyal enough already. Meanwhile, I have a plan. We will single-handedly attack our archenemy the Neutral Planet."
2,5,8,KIF,"Oh, jeez."
2,5,8,ZAPP,"Once the neutral war machine lies in ruins, I'll be a hero again and the DOOP will reinstate me as captain."
2,5,8,KIF,"But, sir, that plan makes no sense."
2,5,8,ZAPP,"Maybe not to you, Kif, but if I recall correctly, you were court-martialed in disgrace."
2,5,8,FRY,"Ooh, burn!"
2,5,8,BENDER,"Nailed you, buddy!"
2,5,9,ZAPP,Prepare to continue the epic struggle between good and neutral.
2,5,9,FRY,"This is awesome! We're gonna be like pow-pow-pow, and they're gonna be like ... ... and then we'll have pancakes to celebrate and I'll be like..."
2,5,9,ZAPP,"Precisely. Now, in the name of all that is good and honourable, we'll call the Neutral President with a message of peace, then blast him."
2,5,9,BENDER,"Yes sir, sirdy-sir-sir-sir!"
2,5,9,ZAPP,Fly the white flag of war.
2,5,9,ZAPP,This is Zapp Brannigan of the good ship ... Planet Express Ship. I come swinging the olive branch of peace.
2,5,9,NEUTRAL PRESIDENT,All I know is my gut says maybe.
2,5,10,BENDER,"What now, chief?"
2,5,10,ZAPP,"Now we crash the ship into their headquarters, killing them in a hellish firestorm from which no living thing can escape."
2,5,10,FRY,"Good, good, then what?"
2,5,10,ZAPP,"Then your mission is complete. I, meanwhile, will have ejected to safety, wearing the only spacesuit on board."
2,5,10,FRY,Wait a second. Is this plan gonna kill us?
2,5,10,ZAPP,"Of course. What do you think I meant by ""loyalty""? Now help me into the only spacesuit. It looks a bit sweaty in there so you may need to apply baby powder."
2,5,10,FRY,"Leela, we want you to be captain again."
2,5,10,LEELA,Let me guess. He cancelled naptime? He ran out of beer? So he's about to kill us?
2,5,10,FRY,We want Leela to be captain again.
2,5,10,ZAPP,"So it's mutiny is it? I never thought I'd see the day. Come, Kif, let's eject. I found a children's spacesuit you can wear."
2,5,10,KIF,"To be honest, sir, I'd rather stay here with Captain Leela. She actually listens to what I have to--"
2,5,10,LEELA,"Oh, no! He's disabled the steering. We're gonna crash!"
2,5,10,BENDER,"Leela save me ... and yourself, I guess ... and my banjo. And Fry."
2,5,10,LEELA,
2,5,10,FRY,Absolutely.
2,5,10,LEELA,Even if I make you work hard?
2,5,10,BENDER,As your God is my witness.
2,5,10,LEELA,Then go get the hover-dolly you didn't break and load all the dark matter into the left engine.
2,5,10,BENDER,"Oh, man, that crap's heavy."
2,5,10,FRY,And warm.
2,5,10,LEELA,Just do it.
2,5,11,NEUTRAL PRESIDENT,"If I don't survive, tell my wife, ""Hello""."
2,5,11,LEELA,Hurry! I don't wanna die at the age of 25.
2,5,11,BENDER,"Honey, unless we hit a time warp, I wouldn't worry about it."
2,5,12,FRY,It's too low.
2,5,12,BENDER,Quick.
2,5,13,LEELA,You did it! You actually did it!
2,5,13,FRY,And no one will have to punish anyone for the mutiny.
2,5,13,ZAPP,"And so, when Captain Leela panicked, perhaps distracted by female troubles, my quick thinking allowed me to do whatever I did to save the day."
2,5,13,GLAB,"Captain Leela, is this rambling story of magic and heroism true?"
2,5,13,LEELA,"Well, actually--"
2,5,13,FARNSWORTH,That a girl! If they don't take him back we can keep him as captain.
2,5,13,LEELA,"Your Honour, it's all true: My female incompetence, Zapp's cat-like reflexes, the stuff that made no sense, all of it."
2,5,13,GLAB,"In that case, Zapp Brannigan, I hereby restore your rank and parking privileges."
2,5,13,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, foo!"
2,5,13,ZAPP,"Come, Kif, we've got work to do."
2,5,13,KIF,I-I'll call and tell you about it.
2,5,13,FRY,"Leela, I just want you to know that even though you're mean, you're the best captain ever."
2,5,13,BENDER,"Yeah, you're one dynamite lady. Can we have a week off?"
2,5,13,LEELA,No.
2,5,13,FRY,Please?
2,5,13,BENDER,"Come on, Captain."
2,5,13,LEELA,"Oh, alright."
2,5,13,FARNSWORTH,No time off.
2,5,13,FRY,"Aw, man."
2,5,13,LEELA,Let's mutiny!
