2,8,0,"""WHY MUST I BE A CRUSTACEAN IN LOVE?""","By Eric Kaplan Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
2,8,0,SINGERS,Call Robo-Rooter when you flush your towel ...
2,8,0,PLUMBERBOT,... And we can also help with an impacted bowel.
2,8,0,SINGERS,Robo-Rooter!
2,8,0,FRY,Mmm. Mmm! Now this is what I call a thousand years of progress: A Bavarian creamdog that's also self-microwaving!
2,8,0,BENDER,"Aw, jeez. Let's just pray I have the energy to get myself another beer. Oh, what is this? The Middle Ages?"
2,8,0,LEELA,"Look at you guys. No offence, Fry, but you've become a fat sack of crap."
2,8,0,FRY,Sack?
2,8,0,AMY,"And, Bender, your beer belly's so big your door won't even close. And that doesn't even make sense."
2,8,0,LEELA,Come on. We're taking you pigs to the gym.
2,8,0,ZOIDBERG,"The gymnasium? Excellent, excellent. For some reason I'm frisky as a squid on Tuesday."
2,8,1,AMY,"Hey, who's up for a nice hot steam?"
2,8,1,ZOIDBERG,We crustaceans don't like steam. I'm going to go work out with the Nautilus!
2,8,1,NAUTILUS,"What up, Dr. Z?"
2,8,1,ZOIDBERG,"Yo, yo, yo! Whassup whassup! Give up the rock!"
2,8,1,FRY,Co-ed steam rooms! I love the future!
2,8,1,LEELA,"Uh, Fry, you're in the womens' steam room."
2,8,1,FRY,"Ah, futuristic!"
2,8,1,AMY,"Psst, look what life was like before genetic engineering."
2,8,1,LEELA,Those poor 20th century women.
2,8,1,AMY,"Hey, handsome. Is there room in there for two?"
2,8,1,MAN,You wish!
2,8,1,FRY,"Hey, Leela, look who's the super-stud!"
2,8,1,LEELA,"Hmm, somebody must have turned down the gravity. I'll fix it for you."
2,8,1,ZOIDBERG,Give me that. More weight!
2,8,1,FRY,"Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, what's that jazz on your head?"
2,8,1,ZOIDBERG,Enough with the questions. More weight! More! More!
2,8,1,LEELA,Maybe you could do more rips with less weight.
2,8,1,BENDER,"Hey, looks like Zoidberg's finally coming out of his shell. Get it? He's coming out--"
2,8,3,RANDY,"Nice and gentle, we don't want any unnecessary stress. Is there a doctor in the gym?"
2,8,3,ZOIDBERG,I'm a doctor!
2,8,3,LEELA,I wonder why Dr. Zoidberg is acting this way. Out of all of us he always seemed the most normal.
2,8,3,ZOIDBERG,"I am normal. Amy, take of these rubber bands and I'll show you how normal I am!"
2,8,3,AMY,"Fool me seven times, shame on you. Fool me eight or more times, shame on me."
2,8,3,FRY,Maybe he has a parasite.
2,8,3,HERMES,Maybe he is a parasite!
2,8,3,BENDER,It's always so sad when a friend goes crazy and you have to have a big clam-bake and cook him! Yee-haw!
2,8,3,FARNSWORTH,"Now, now, this won't do. Let me just give old Zoidy a sedative."
2,8,3,ZOIDBERG,"Ah, much better. You can take off these rubber bands now."
2,8,3,AMY,I'll do it.
2,8,3,LEELA,Stop!
2,8,3,FRY,"No, Amy!"
2,8,3,BENDER,Moron!
2,8,3,FARNSWORTH,Mm-hm... Oh-ho! Aha! There's the problem.
2,8,3,ZOIDBERG,"Give it to me straight, Professor. Is it fin rot? It's fin rot, isn't it? Tell me it's not fin rot!"
2,8,3,FARNSWORTH,"Relax, my chiton-y chum. There's no problem. You're just heavy with male jelly."
2,8,3,LEELA,Bleck!
2,8,3,FARNSWORTH,It must be mating season for Zoidberg's people. A chaotic time when his behaviour is dictated by the tiny brain in his rump.
2,8,3,FRY,Eck!
2,8,3,FARNSWORTH,There's only one thing we can do...
2,8,3,BENDER,I'll get the water boiling!
2,8,3,FARNSWORTH,"...We, by which I mean you, will have to rush him to his ancient homeworld which will shortly erupt in an orgy of invertebrate sex."
2,8,3,FRY,"Oh, baby, I'm there!"
2,8,3,LEELA,"Fry, do you even understand the word ""invertebrate""?"
2,8,3,FRY,"Nope, but that's not the word I'm interested in. Uh, no need to pack pants, people. Let's roll!"
2,8,3,AMY,Dr. Zoidberg said I should hold these while he's gone.
2,8,4,BENDER,Moron!
2,8,5,DECAPOD MANM #1,"Welcome home, old friend. Just 19 hours until the mating frenzy!"
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,"Excellent, excellent!"
2,8,5,DECAPOD MAN #1,See you there Doctor--
2,8,5,FRY,"Is that how you say ""Zoidberg""?"
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,You didn't have to call attention to his speech impediment.
2,8,5,BENDER,"You're looking less nuts, crabby."
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,"I'm feeling less nuts, thank you, because tomorrow I will be depositing my jelly in the cloacal vents of a female. If you catch my drift."
2,8,5,FRY,Who's the lucky lobsterina?
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,I don't know yet. But I shall attract one this afternoon with an erotic display.
2,8,5,LEELA,It's amazing that your people can fall in love so fast.
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,Love? That word is unknown here. I'm simply looking for a female swollen with eggs to accept my genetic material.
2,8,5,FRY,"You and me both, brother!"
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,"Ah, my old scuttling grounds! Let's pull over."
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,"I used to hang out here as a larva. It looked so much bigger back then. Who's the tough guy now, Vinnie?"
2,8,5,BENDER,"Look! Outdoor theatre! Let's get tickets. Oh, let's do!"
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,"No, it's the ceremony of Claw-Plach, where my species fight to the death over matters of honour. Also whether abbreviations count in Scrabble. They don't!"
2,8,5,FRY,I didn't come here to see any activity involving two guys. Where do you people do your erotic display?
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,Same place as your species: The beach.
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,How do I look?
2,8,5,BENDER,Like whale barf.
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,Then the illusion is complete.
2,8,5,FRY,"Hey, I wonder if these guys are here to watch the erotic display too."
2,8,5,DECAPOD MAN #2,"Aw, yeah! Aw, wow!"
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,Perfect! This oughta make me stand out. Craw!
2,8,5,FRY,Look how ridiculous they look.
2,8,5,BENDER,"Please, he's no different from the rest of you organisms; Shooting DNA at each other make babies. I find it offensive."
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,Craw!
2,8,5,DECAPOD WOMAN #1,Keep your jelly away from my eggs!
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,Craw?!
2,8,5,DECAPOD WOMAN #2,So not interested.
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,Craw!
2,8,5,DECAPOD WOMAN #3,Hmph. I've heard that line before!
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,"Cra-- Oh, what's the point?"
2,8,5,LEELA,Why is Zoidberg the only one still alone?
2,8,5,BENDER,"'Cause he's a loser, that's why. He's the lobster equivalent of Fry."
2,8,5,FRY,Hey! I can get any girl I want anytime I want. I'm just too busy.
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,"Edna?! Edna, it's me, Zoidberg. Remember? From high school? You used to laugh at me because my face was covered with barnacles!"
2,8,5,EDNA,Zoidberg? Well I didn't know you were back in town. I heard you went off and became a rich doctor.
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,"I've performed a few mercy killings. So, as long as I'm in town I was wondering if maybe ... craw?"
2,8,5,EDNA,"Oh, gee, yeah, I'm just going through a lot of things right now and-- Look, Zoidberg, I carry more eggs than any other female and I owe it to our race to pick a mate who's stuffed with male jelly. Maybe a rock star."
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,Or maybe a doctor?
2,8,5,EDNA,"I'm sorry, Zoidberg. You're just an inferior male specimen. Nice seeing you again."
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,"No one will ever want to mate with me, not with a puny claw like this. Did you see those other guys? They looked like giant claws with bodies attached."
2,8,5,LEELA,At least you didn't smell as bad as them.
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,"You're right, my stink gland is weak. Smell!"
2,8,5,FRY,"Listen, Doc, if you wanna score you gotta fake like you're in love. Just look her in the eye, start crying and say ""I've never been so happy""."
2,8,5,LEELA,If a guy ever did that to me I'd know it. Wait a second. They've all been doing that to me. Even Sean!
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,"Hmm, this ""love"" intrigues me. Teach me to fake it."
2,8,5,FRY,
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,Ask her to mate with me.
2,8,5,FRY,No. Tell her she's special.
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,But she's not. She's merely the female with the largest clutch of eggs.
2,8,5,FRY,"Well, tell her that. And then?"
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,Then mating.
2,8,5,FRY,No. Make up some feelings and tell her you have them. Yes?
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,Is desire to mate a feeling?
2,8,5,FRY,You're not even trying!
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,It's all so complicated with the flowers and the romance and the lies upon lies.
2,8,5,FRY,
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,What? Now there's a bird involved?
2,8,5,FRY,
2,8,5,EDNA,"What the--? Dr. Zoidberg, your mating display failed. Why are you trying to talk to me?"
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,I have no idea.
2,8,5,FRY,"You just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating."
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,"I just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense."
2,8,5,EDNA,"Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But OK."
2,8,5,FRY,Start with a compliment: Tell her she looks thin.
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from internal parasites?
2,8,5,EDNA,"Why, yes. Thanks for noticing."
2,8,5,FRY,Now ask her how her day was.
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,Why would I wanna know?
2,8,5,FRY,You wouldn't. Ask anyway.
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,How was your day?
2,8,5,EDNA,Well first I got up and had a piece of toast. Then I brushed my teeth. Then I went to the store to buy some fish. Then...
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,"Fry, look what you did, she won't shut up."
2,8,5,FRY,"That's normal. Just nod your head and say ""Uh-huh"""
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,"Uh-huh, uh-huh."
2,8,5,EDNA,"...And then you threw an octopus at my window. You know, Zoidberg, it's crazy but when you talk this way your obvious deficiencies as a male seem ... less obvious. Your genes seem less detrimental. You even stink more."
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,Do I ask her to mate now?
2,8,5,FRY,Third date!
2,8,5,BENDER,So I returned his artificial heart and ever since then I've been known by the name of Honest Bender.
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,I'd like to propose a toast to ... coat check number 84.
2,8,5,FRY,Turn it over.
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,"Oh, Edna! Of all the slimy, gross crab monsters on this planet, you are apparently the hottest."
2,8,5,BENDER,Oy.
2,8,5,FRY,That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.
2,8,5,EDNA,"Yes, well ... excuse me, I've got to powder my mouth flaps."
2,8,5,LEELA,"Uh, me too."
2,8,5,ZOIDBERG,"I'm confused, Fry. I'm feeling a strange new emotion. Is it love when you care about a female for reasons beyond mating?"
2,8,5,FRY,Nope. Must be some weird alien emotion.
2,8,5,LEELA,"Zoidberg said some dumb stuff but he's a nice guy, really. It's just that Fry's been telling him what to say and Fry's a ... do you have idiots on your planet?"
2,8,5,EDNA,Fry? You mean words of such beauty came from the blowhole of that hideous alien?
2,8,5,LEELA,"Yeah ... What? Look, never mind the words. Zoidberg's a doctor. A doctor honey."
2,8,5,EDNA,Hmm.
2,8,5,EDNA,Come in.
2,8,6,EDNA,"Hello, Fry. Can I interest you in some surf and turf?"
2,8,6,FRY,No thanks. I just came to tell you that Zoidberg's really great. He's got male jelly coming out the wazoo.
2,8,6,EDNA,"Well that is where it comes out but jelly isn't everything. I know Zoidberg's magical words were really yours. Teach me to love you, squishy poet from beyond the stars!"
2,8,6,FRY,"Uh, I'm flattered, really. If I was gonna do it with a big, freaky mud bug you'd be way up the list!"
2,8,6,EDNA,"Hush, you romantic fool! Engage your mandibles and kiss me!"
2,8,6,ZOIDBERG,"Edna, I couldn't stand it any longer. I-- Fry!"
2,8,6,FRY,"Dr. Zoidberg, it's not how it looks."
2,8,6,ZOIDBERG,Her caviar is on your neck!
2,8,6,FRY,But--
2,8,6,EDNA,"Oh, it's true, Zoidberg. We can't hide it any longer. Fry and I have fallen in love and we're going to mate tomorrow."
2,8,6,FRY,What?!
2,8,6,ZOIDBERG,Fry! I challenge you to Claw-Plach!
2,8,6,FRY,English please?
2,8,6,ZOIDBERG,A fight to the death.
2,8,6,EDNA,"And if you survive, we'll make sweet love!"
2,8,6,DECAPOD EMPEROR,The law is clear. Fry and Zoidberg shall fight to the death for the claw of the beautiful Edna.
2,8,6,FRY,But I don't want her!
2,8,6,DECAPOD EMPEROR,"Once invoked, the sacred tradition of Claw-Plach can not be taken back. It is a recent tradition - only 18 years old - but it is a tradition none the less."
2,8,6,ZOIDBERG,"Get ready, Fry. I'm going to rip your swim bladder out and show it to you."
2,8,6,LEELA,"Dr. Zoidberg, this is madness. You're being irrational."
2,8,6,ZOIDBERG,Of course I'm being irrational! I'm in love!
2,8,6,LEELA,Aww.
2,8,6,FRY,Leela!
2,8,6,LEELA,"Right, right. You have to stop this madness."
2,8,6,DECAPOD EMPEROR,"Listen, lady, as you can plainly see I'm a highly desirable male, groaning with jelly. Yet I embrace a life of celibacy in order to uphold our crazy traditions. One of your friends must die."
2,8,6,BENDER,"Fate is cruel and unyielding and what must be must be. Takin' all bets! I'm giving 9-2 on Zoidberg, the crab with the jab! The Great Red Hope, come on baby!"
2,8,6,ZOIDBERG,"Fry, it's been years since medical school so remind me: Disembowelling in your species - Fatal or non-fatal?"
2,8,6,FRY,Fatal.
2,8,6,ZOIDBERG,Large bet on myself in round one!
2,8,6,DECAPOD EMPEROR,"Edna, have you anything to say before begins the Claw-Plach?"
2,8,6,EDNA,I do. I just want to say that today I got up and I had a piece of toast. Then I brushed my teeth--
2,8,6,FRY,Shut up!
2,8,6,EDNA,"I love you, Fry!"
2,8,6,DECAPOD EMPEROR,"Fry, having guessed what animal I was thinking of, you shall have first choice of weapon. And you, doctor?"
2,8,6,ZOIDBERG,I choose my own claws! I want the tactile pleasure of chopping him right here in the gonads!
2,8,6,FRY,Shh! Nobody correct him!
2,8,6,BENDER,"Fry, I've never asked you for anything before but if it's not too much trouble, when it comes to the ninth round just let him win."
2,8,6,FRY,But it's a fight to the death!
2,8,6,BENDER,"Oh, so this is suddenly all about you. Sheesh!"
2,8,6,DECAPOD EMPEROR,Please rise for the national anthem.
2,8,6,FRY,Uh-oh.
2,8,6,DECAPOD EMPEROR,Let Claw-Plach begin!
2,8,6,FRY,Hey!
2,8,6,BENDER,Ow!
2,8,6,LEELA,"Come on, Fry! Die with dignity!"
2,8,6,FRY,Aha! Oops!
2,8,6,EDNA,Nooo! I can't stand to look.
2,8,6,ZOIDBERG,Huh?
2,8,6,BENDER,"Psst, Fry. Take a dive."
2,8,6,CROWD,Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach!
2,8,6,FRY,"My fellow fish monsters. Far be it for me to question your stupid civilisation or its dumb customs. But is squeezing each others brains out with a giant nutcracker really going to solve anything? Dr. Zoidberg is my friend. And though a woman has come between us, I say we'll always remain friends. And you know why? One reason."
2,8,6,FRY,You bastard! I'll kill you! You bastard!
2,8,6,LEELA,Wait! Stop! Everyone is gone.
2,8,6,ZOIDBERG,Edna? Honey?
2,8,9,ZOIDBERG,Edna?
2,8,9,LEELA,Ew!
2,8,9,BENDER,"Oh, my God!"
2,8,9,ZOIDBERG,"The frenzy! Oh, the greatest experience in life and I missed it."
2,8,9,FRY,"Aw. I'm sorry, Doc."
2,8,9,FRY,"Ow, ow! Ah!"
2,8,9,ZOIDBERG,The frenzy is over. How will I ever get rid of my male jelly now?
2,8,9,FRY,I'll lend you this.
2,8,9,LEELA,Fry!
2,8,9,FRY,"Hey, hey."
2,8,9,BENDER,Shoo! Get away! Hey! What's with the flying jerks?
2,8,9,ZOIDBERG,"They come to feast after the frenzy. Once my species passes on its genes, it dies."
2,8,9,FRY,You mean you have to choose between a life without sex and a gruesome death?
2,8,9,ZOIDBERG,Yes.
2,8,9,FRY,Tough call.
2,8,10,ZOIDBERG,"Well it was nice of you to let me reattach your arm, Fry. Especially after I made a complete eel out of myself."
2,8,10,FRY,No biggie.
2,8,10,ZOIDBERG,"Yes biggie. I learned to feel things I'd never felt before: Love, jealousy, passion for disembowling. I owe it all to you. There! I pronounce the operation a success."
2,8,10,LEELA,Hooray!
2,8,10,BENDER,Yeah!
2,8,10,FRY,Yeah!
2,8,10,ZOIDBERG,"I may not know from emotions but when it comes to medicine, forget about it."
2,8,10,FRY,"I don't mean to nitpick, super-doc, but do you think maybe you could take one more whack at this?"
2,8,10,ZOIDBERG,"For you, my friend, anything."
2,8,10,FRY,My legs!
2,8,10,ZOIDBERG,"Alright, alright, third time's the charm."
