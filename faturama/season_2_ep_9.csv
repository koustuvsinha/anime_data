2,9,0,"""PUT YOUR HEAD ON MY SHOULDER""","By Ken Keeler Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
2,9,0,LINCOLN,Four score and 1145 years ago our forefather's foreheads conceived a new nation.
2,9,0,WASHINGTON,And this Presidents' Day we honoureth those values that my body fought and died for.
2,9,0,MALFUNCTIONING EDDIE,"Values like this brand new Plymouth V'Ger! Hi, I'm Malfunctioning Eddie and I'm malfunctioning so badly I'm practically giving these cars away!"
2,9,0,AMY,"Hey, let's go car shopping! My parents promised if I got all B's they'd buy me a bar. And I got all C's!"
2,9,0,BENDER,Mind if I tag along? I gotta bring my ass in for servicing. The recall notice says it could burst into flames in a low-speed collision.
2,9,0,FRY,No wonder you've been staying at the back of conga lines lately.
2,9,0,LEELA,"I'll get my coat. Let's go, Bender."
2,9,0,VICTOR,"Hello, I am Victor and I know many things about the art of unloading fine cars on beautiful women."
2,9,0,LEELA,Uh-huh. Now tell us she's witty and sophisticated.
2,9,0,VICTOR,"Ah-ah-ah! A gentleman always sells a lady a car first. This is the Beta Romeo. Yes, the Beta Romeo. Note the cross-your-heart seat belt which protects, lifts and separates."
2,9,0,SALESMAN,"Spotted her the minute you walked in, didn't you, sir? She's a real beauty."
2,9,0,FRY,"Yup, she's beautiful coffee alright."
2,9,0,SALESMAN,"No, the Ford Thundercougarfalconbird! Nothing makes you feel more like a man than a Thundercougarfalconbird. So how much were you thinking of spending on this Thundercougarfalconbird?"
2,9,0,FRY,"Sorry, I'm not here to buy."
2,9,0,SALESMAN,I understand and it's wonderful you don't care whether anyone questions your sexual orientation.
2,9,0,FRY,I care! I care plenty! I just don't know how to make them stop!
2,9,0,SALESMAN,One word: Thundercougarfalconbird!
2,9,0,VICTOR,"The luxurious seats are stuffed with eagle down and the dashboard inlaid with the beaks of a thousand eagles. Also, there are some eagles under the floorboards."
2,9,0,AMY,That's an awful lot of eagle.
2,9,0,VICTOR,"Yes, and yet--"
2,9,0,AMY,What's wrong?
2,9,0,VICTOR,"It is just, the luxury edition has so much more eagle. It saddens me to think of you missing out."
2,9,0,AMY,"Oh, don't be sad. My parents are paying and they're incredibly rich."
2,9,0,MECHANIC,I installed shock-absorbing bumpers to reduce the risk of catastrophic butt failure.
2,9,0,BENDER,"You, sir, have defaced a national treasure! I demand you restore my buttocks to their former glory."
2,9,0,MECHANIC,"Alright. But sooner or later that ass is gonna blow. And when it does, I just pray you're not moonin' someone you care about."
2,9,0,AMY,"Smeesh, Leela! This car has everything a beautiful woman like me needs. Victor said so."
2,9,0,VICTOR,No dog food for Victor tonight.
2,9,0,LEELA,
2,9,0,"60,000!",
2,9,0,VICTOR,"Oh, I will have to ask my manager."
2,9,0,LEELA,"Amy, you don't go up from the sticker price."
2,9,0,AMY,I thought it was an auction.
2,9,0,VICTOR,He is not too happy.
2,9,0,AMY,"I'm sorry. 80,000?"
2,9,0,AMY,Uh-oh. I'm terrible at parallel parking.
2,9,0,HERMES,And now you're asking for a day off? Get out of my and my sight! You're bogarting my patience.
2,9,0,LEELA,Hermes. Who were you yelling at?
2,9,0,HERMES,Myself. I asked myself a Valentine's Day off. But I was in no mood for any of my shenanigans.
2,9,0,FRY,"Valentine's Day's coming? Oh, crap! I forgot to get a girlfriend again. Well since neither of us has a date, why don't we..."
2,9,0,LEELA,You just assume I can't get a Valentine's date?
2,9,0,FRY,Shall we say 8 o'clock?
2,9,0,AMY,"Hey, I'm taking my new car out for a spin to Mercury. Anybody wanna come?"
2,9,0,FRY,"Yeah, OK. What's the weather like?"
2,9,0,AMY,"The usual: Boiling lead, oceans of lava."
2,9,0,FRY,"So, what? Shorts?"
2,9,0,FRY,"Boy, this A.C. is incredible! I'd better turn on the heater too. Boy, this heater is incredible! I'd better turn up the A.C. some more."
2,9,0,AMY,"Hey, how about some icy margaritas?"
2,9,0,FRY,Yeah! We're slowing down!
2,9,0,AMY,Don't worry. I'll hit the fuel guzzler!
2,9,0,FRY,Who wants pop-tarts? Uh-oh!
2,9,0,AMY,"It's OK, I have an emergency phone."
2,9,0,FRY,What are you doing?
2,9,0,AMY,Spluh! It's a video-phone. Lucky I'm a member of the Astro-Afro-Antarctico-Amer-Asian Auto Association. Hello? Septuple-A?
2,9,0,FRY,Phew!
2,9,0,AMY,"It'll be a couple hours. Oh, I'm gonna get sweat on my sweat-suit."
2,9,0,FRY,"Hey, tell me something: You've got all this money, how come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?"
2,9,0,AMY,I guess 'cause my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!
2,9,0,FRY,"I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the Pope?"
2,9,0,AMY,"Yeah, and if you were the Pope they'd be all, ""Straighten your Pope hat,"" and, ""Put on your good vestments"". You know, Fry, its nice to find someone I can talk to about stuff, and junk."
2,9,0,FRY,"Yeah, it's like we feel the same way about junk and stuff, or, whatever."
2,9,1,AMY,"So while they're towin' us, you wanna do it?"
2,9,1,FRY,Yeah.
2,9,1,HERMES,"Which concludes the summary of the movie I saw last night. Now, any old business? Any new business? Anyone spend the night together?"
2,9,1,AMY,Yep.
2,9,1,FRY,Kind of.
2,9,1,BENDER,What?
2,9,1,HERMES,"Oh, my God!"
2,9,1,AMY,We ran out of fuel on Mercury and one thing led to another.
2,9,1,FRY,And it led there again when we got home.
2,9,1,BENDER,"Congratulations, Fry, you snagged the perfect girlfriend. Amy's rich, she's probably got other characteristics."
2,9,1,LEELA,Bender! Romance isn't about money.
2,9,1,BENDER,"Oh, so it's just coincidence that Zoidberg here is desperately poor and miserably lonely? Puh-lease!"
2,9,1,LEELA,"For your information, it's because he's hideous."
2,9,1,HERMES,Well I think Amy and Fry go together like a lime and coconut.
2,9,1,FARNSWORTH,Do I hear wedding bells?
2,9,1,FRY,What? No!
2,9,1,FARNSWORTH,"Really? Oh, dear."
2,9,1,ZOIDBERG,You're both very lucky. I'd pay anything to end my miserable loneliness. If only I weren't so desperately poor.
2,9,1,BENDER,Wait. You mean people will pay good money for romance? Hmm. I think I have a scheme so deviously clever that I--
2,9,1,JUDGE,$500 and time served.
2,9,1,BENDER,"Stupid anti-pimping laws. Well, pay the man!"
2,9,1,HOOKERBOT,"Bender, honey, we love you!"
2,9,1,BENDER,"Shut up, baby, I know it!"
2,9,1,BENDER,"Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping but you rarely have to use the phrase ""upside your head""."
2,9,1,LEELA,"Bender, this is stupid. Why would anyone come to you for romantic help?"
2,9,1,BENDER,Hey! Don't make me go upside your head!
2,9,1,HERMES,Fry! Amy! Put your pants back on; I need a stapler.
2,9,1,ZOIDBERG,Stop! Stop! If you interrupt the mating dance the male will become enraged and maul us with his fearsome gonad.
2,9,2,FRY,"It's working, they think we're making out. Wait, why aren't we making out?"
2,9,2,AMY,I 'unno.
2,9,3,BENDER,
2,9,3,ZAPP,"Uh, Smith! Zapp Smith. Uh, Brannigan."
2,9,3,BENDER,Just check off the things you're looking for in a love partner.
2,9,3,ZAPP,"Let's see ... Oh, yes! Yes, definitely. Oh, I'd like some of that. Mmm, I'll just have everything on the menu."
2,9,3,BENDER,Now to run it through our high speed romance-a-logical data-fier. Say hello to Miss Right!
2,9,3,ZAPP,Hello!
2,9,3,FRY,Wow! We're great kissers!
2,9,3,AMY,"Yeah! Hey, later, you wanna drive out to Europa? We could have a picnic and spit watermelon seeds at Jupiter."
2,9,3,FRY,"Hey, yeah! I used to spit at stuff back in the 20th century. Ah, it's cool how we sort of think exactly alike, and junk."
2,9,3,AMY,"Yeah. Y'know, Fry, I really like hanging out with you."
2,9,3,FRY,"Everything was going great. Then all of a sudden, she's talking about hanging out. Hangin out? She's getting way too serious. I'm not a one woman man, Leela."
2,9,3,LEELA,You'll be back to zero soon enough.
2,9,3,FRY,Don't you get it? She's smothering me.
2,9,3,AMY,Hi.
2,9,3,FRY,You see? You see? Now she's bothering me when I'm at work.
2,9,3,LEELA,Fry--!
2,9,3,FRY,I'm doing my job -- there's Amy. I spend a few hours selecting a candy from the machine -- there's Amy. I wake up the morning after sleeping with Amy -- there's Amy!
2,9,3,LEELA,I think you're over reacting.
2,9,3,FRY,"Am I? Am I? Face it, I'm a prize catch. I mean, I'm pulling down delivery boy money."
2,9,3,LEELA,"Fry, she's pulling down billionaire trust-fund money."
2,9,3,FRY,"Then she wants me as a trophy husband. Leela, you gotta come to Europa with us, I can't be alone with her."
2,9,3,AMY,"So, ready for a secluded picnic with just you and me?"
2,9,3,FRY,"Hey, you know who loves secluded picnics with just you and me? Uh, Dr. Zoidberg."
2,9,3,ZOIDBERG,Did someone say something about a free hot meal?
2,9,3,ZOIDBERG,"Mmm, I haven't eaten since Tuesday! Bird eggs, animal slices ... ... dry woven reeds! All gone! Can I drive?"
2,9,3,AMY,"No. So, Fry, you busy tomorrow? I got two tickets to the big ape fight."
2,9,3,FRY,"Jeez, we're already planning to spend Valentine's Day together. Isn't that enough?"
2,9,3,AMY,
2,9,3,FRY,"Oh, so all of a sudden we're spending Valentine's Day together?"
2,9,3,AMY,But you just said--
2,9,3,FRY,"That's it, Amy, we have to talk. Zoidberg, you drive."
2,9,3,ZOIDBERG,Wahoo!
2,9,4,FRY,"Pardon me, excuse me."
2,9,5,ZOIDBERG,"Ah, I'll just turn the wheel to maximum fastness!"
2,9,5,FRY,"Amy, you know how at first you like chocolate but then you start to get tired of it because it always wants to hang out with you?"
2,9,5,AMY,Huh? You don't like chocolate?
2,9,5,FRY,"Look, could chocolate just let me finish?"
2,9,5,ZOIDBERG,Vroom vroom! And the winner of the big car race is: Hot Rod Zoidberg!
2,9,5,FRY,"Amy, what I'm trying to say is, I think maybe you and I should stop--"
2,9,5,ZOIDBERG,"Uh-oh. Here, you drive!"
2,9,5,ZOIDBERG,Fry? Are you alright?
2,9,5,FRY,Ow! My head is killing me. What happened? Was anybody hurt?
2,9,5,ZOIDBERG,"No, no, no, no, no, of course not. Nobody but you. I'm afraid your body was badly damaged in the crash."
2,9,5,FRY,How badly?
2,9,5,ZOIDBERG,"That's it over there. Don't worry, I managed to keep your head alive with some quick surgery."
2,9,5,FRY,Where is it?
2,9,5,ZOIDBERG,There.
2,9,5,AMY,"Looks like we'll be spending a lot more time together, Fry!"
2,9,5,LEELA,This sort of thing always happens with office romances.
2,9,5,ZOIDBERG,"Don't worry, Fry, we'll have your body all fixed up in a few days. Upsy daisy!"
2,9,5,FRY,"Well, Amy, I'll try not to interfere with your life too much."
2,9,5,AMY,Fry!
2,9,5,FRY,"Ooh, sorry. I guess I control that arm."
2,9,5,AMY,"So, what was it you wanted to talk about before we crashed anyway?"
2,9,5,FRY,"Oh, that. Maybe we'd better talk in private. I'll meet you in the closet."
2,9,5,FRY,"Amy, I really like you, as a friend. But I think we're spending too much time together."
2,9,5,AMY,You're breaking up with me?
2,9,5,FRY,I just think we should start seeing other people.
2,9,5,AMY,"But, I was really having fun. If that's how you feel."
2,9,5,FRY,"I'm sorry, but it is."
2,9,5,AMY,"Well, whatever. Hey, listen, as long as we're not seeing each other, you mind if I ask someone else out for Valentine's Day?"
2,9,5,FRY,Huh?
2,9,5,AMY,"I mean, unless it would make you feel bad, being a third wheel."
2,9,5,FRY,"Hey, I can get a date too. Now that I'm single, I'll attract all sorts of women!"
2,9,5,AMY,With my body I think you might only attract one sort of woman.
2,9,5,FRY,Oh! Oh!
2,9,5,LEELA,"So, how's business?"
2,9,5,BENDER,"Are you familiar with my friend Al Gore? I'm tellin' ya, losers get really desperate around Valentine's Day."
2,9,5,LEELA,"Yeah, it's pathetic alright! How much?"
2,9,5,BENDER,500 bucks.
2,9,5,LEELA,Done.
2,9,5,BENDER,Zapp Brannigan OK?
2,9,5,LEELA,No!
2,9,5,600.,
2,9,6,FRY,"Oh, hey, Leela, uh, can I talk to you for a minute? In private?"
2,9,6,AMY,"Oh, no problem."
2,9,6,FRY,"This is an emergency. Amy made Valentine's plans with some goon and I'm gonna be stuck there, lonely and miserable. Will you be my date, please?"
2,9,6,LEELA,"You're too late, Fry. I'm sharing Valentine's Day with a very special man. He's not Zapp Brannigan or anything!"
2,9,6,FRY,Then I have no choice but to do something so pitiful and embarrassing that I'm ashamed to tell you about it.
2,9,6,LEELA,Bender's in his office.
2,9,6,FRY,Thanks.
2,9,6,BENDER,"I got your hook-up, Fry. Now my usual fee's 500 bucks, but seeing as how it's you, I'll need it in advance."
2,9,6,AMY,
2,9,6,FRY,Why exactly did you shave your legs anyway? Are you expecting something to happen with your Valentine's date?
2,9,6,AMY,What business is it of yours?
2,9,6,FRY,And another thing: You're using an awful lot of make-up there.
2,9,6,AMY,This is deodorant.
2,9,6,FRY,What does it do?
2,9,6,AMY,"C'mon in, Gary! I'll just be another 20 minutes."
2,9,6,GARY,I'll be waiting.
2,9,6,FRY,20 minutes? You're practically ready now!
2,9,6,AMY,"Yeah, but it's good to make them wait a little."
2,9,6,FRY,"Oh, God, it's true!"
2,9,6,GARY,That dress looks great on you.
2,9,6,AMY,Thanks.
2,9,6,FRY,Thanks. Where is she?
2,9,6,GARY,"I must say, Amy, you're all made up, just like Fry's date. Get it?"
2,9,6,AMY,Mm-mm.
2,9,6,FRY,I've got a date. She'll be along any minute.
2,9,6,BENDER,"Fry, look who I found! It's Petunia, your dream girl!"
2,9,6,PETUNIA,How's them eats?
2,9,6,FRY,Uh--
2,9,6,PETUNIA,Don't mind if I do. Kids'll be hungry.
2,9,6,FRY,She seems a little old for me.
2,9,6,BENDER,She is well-travelled. And I don't mean she travels a lot!
2,9,6,PETUNIA,Wheels fell off my house.
2,9,6,BENDER,Now how about a rose for the lady? Five bucks a pop!
2,9,6,GARY,I'll take one.
2,9,6,FRY,"Oh, yeah? Well I want one too."
2,9,6,BENDER,Eight bucks.
2,9,6,FRY,But you just said--
2,9,6,BENDER,"Demand suddenly skyrocketed, you all saw it."
2,9,6,BENDER,"Leela, meets your future husband Sal."
2,9,6,SAL,"Nice eyeball, eyeball."
2,9,6,LEELA,"Nice ass, ass."
2,9,6,BENDER,"Ooh, sparks! Buy her a rose, I guarantee she'll put out!"
2,9,6,SAL,"Eh, I'll take my chances."
2,9,6,ZAPP,Cheers!
2,9,6,"""WOMAN""",Cheers!
2,9,6,PETUNIA,So tell me about your prospects. You a good gambler?
2,9,6,FRY,"Well, ma'am I--"
2,9,6,PETUNIA,What's your game? Bingo? Keno? Wait a minute! You don't have your own body.
2,9,6,FRY,"No, but I control this arm."
2,9,6,PETUNIA,"Slots player, huh? Sorry, but I think I can do better."
2,9,6,FRY,"Wait, come back, uh, darling."
2,9,6,PETUNIA,"Can't, hon. I gotta catch my bus back to Nutley. I'd kiss you goodnight but I lost my teeth pulling out a stump."
2,9,6,SAL,"So anyways, Leela, I'd love to take a whack at ya but that 10:15 to Nutley ain't goin' nowheres without yours truly behinds the wheel."
2,9,6,PETUNIA,"Excuse me, did you say ""10:15 to Nutley""?"
2,9,6,SAL,"Why, yes I dids."
2,9,6,LEELA,Bender! Did you just round up our dates at the bus station?
2,9,6,BENDER,Of course not.
2,9,6,SAL,Anybodys else for Nutley?
2,9,6,ZAPP,"Baby, wait! You didn't show me your surprise."
2,9,6,GARY,You know what I'd like to do...?
2,9,6,FRY,"Oh, jeez, get a room!"
2,9,6,GARY,Maybe later.
2,9,6,FRY,"Hey, I have an idea: Let's all go out for ice cream."
2,9,6,GARY,"Actually, I thought Amy might like to come back to my place for coffee."
2,9,6,AMY,I don't really like coffee.
2,9,6,GARY,Neither do I.
2,9,6,AMY,"Ooh, I feel a little tipsy!"
2,9,6,GARY,Let me pick up the check.
2,9,6,FRY,Nooo! That's it I'm gettin' the hell outta here. Ooh! Ow!
2,9,6,LEELA,"Why, if it isn't my favourite head on Amy's body: Fry."
2,9,6,FRY,"Oh, Leela!"
2,9,6,AMY,We were just on our way out.
2,9,6,LEELA,"Nonsense, the evening's young. So, Gary, what do you do for a living?"
2,9,6,GARY,I'm a banking industry regulator.
2,9,6,LEELA,Really? Y'know I heard that banking industry regulations are really very simple.
2,9,6,GARY,"Oh, no, that's not true. You see, modern banking regulations are a product of five different regulatory traditions. Six if you wanna get technical."
2,9,6,LEELA,"Oh, I do."
2,9,6,GARY,It all began in 1410 when a number of noblemen convened...
2,9,6,FRY (WHISPERING),Thank you.
2,9,6,ZOIDBERG,"There you are, good as new. Except for your dorsal fin, I'm afraid I couldn't find it after the crash."
2,9,6,FRY,Can I live without it?
2,9,6,ZOIDBERG,If you call that living.
2,9,6,FARNSWORTH,I still don't understand why you wouldn't let me graft a laser cannon onto your chest. To crush those who disobey you. But I guess we're just two different people.
2,9,6,FRY,"So, uh, thanks for the ride, Amy. And I hope there are no hard feelings about your date, or stuff."
2,9,6,AMY,"It's OK, I had fun. And if I ever feel lonely I can just look over at this disfiguring scar and think of you."
2,9,6,FRY,"Well, anyway, it's nice to have my own body back."
2,9,6,LEELA,So how's the old corpse? Everything hooked up OK?
2,9,6,FRY,"Seems to be. My neck's just a little tender. Ow! Cool! Ow! Listen, Leela. Thanks for rescuing me last night."
2,9,6,LEELA,Anytime. I actually enjoyed hanging out with you.
2,9,6,BENDER,"Yep, everything worked out great thanks to good old Bender."
2,9,6,LEELA,Come on! It's not like you intentionally set us up with bad dates so we'd spend Valentine's Day together.
2,9,6,BENDER,"Didn't I, Leela? Didn't I?"
2,9,6,LEELA,No! You didn't! You just corralled a bunch of stiffs at the bus station and pocketed our money!
2,9,6,BENDER,"True. But in the end, isn't that what Valentine's Day is really all about?"
2,9,6,LEELA,Yeah.
2,9,6,FRY,I guess so. Watch the neck! Watch the neck!
2,9,6,BENDER,My ass! My beautiful ass!
