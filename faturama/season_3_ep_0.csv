3,0,0,"""THE HONKING""","By Ken Keeler Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
3,0,0,DOCTORBOT,Notify his survivors.
3,0,0,BENDER,
3,0,0,HERMES,"Mail call! Amy, here's your designer lingerie catalogue, Fry, Sadie's Bra Parade and Leela, Bulk Underpants Outlet."
3,0,0,LEELA,You buy one pound of underwear and you're on their list forever.
3,0,0,HERMES,"And for Bender, uh-oh: A black-bordered envelope."
3,0,0,AMY,"Oh no, someone you know must've died."
3,0,0,BENDER,"I hope it was one of my enemies, those guys suck! Oh no, my uncle Vladimir."
3,0,0,FRY,"Oh, I'm sorry, Bender. When's the funeral?"
3,0,0,BENDER,"Tomorrow, at the family castle. Followed by the reading of his will. Well, I'm rich. Goodbye, losers, whom I've always hated! C'mon, it'll be fun!"
3,0,0,BENDER,"Uh, pardon me, my good simpleton, could you take us to yon castle?"
3,0,0,ROBOT #1,Some say unholy things happen up there.
3,0,0,ROBOT #2,For example: All of us say that.
3,0,0,FARNSWORTH,Fuf! Superstitious robot mumbo-jumbo.
3,0,0,ROBOT #2,"Mumbo, perhaps. Jumbo, perhaps not! With all your modern science are you any closer to understanding the mystery of how a robot walks or talks?"
3,0,0,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, you idiot. The circuit diagram is right here on the inside of your case."
3,0,0,ROBOT #2,I choose to believe what I was programmed to believe.
3,0,0,ROBOT #2,I will go this far and no further.
3,0,0,PREACHERBOT,I now commend Vladimir's remains to the earth. Filings to filings; rust to rust.
3,0,0,SOLICITORBOT,"To my loyal butler, You There, I leave a pittance, to be paid in 20 equal installments of one-twentieth of a pittance each. To my lazy, spoiled son, Tandy, who never learned the value of a dollar, I leave my entire $10 million fortune."
3,0,0,TANDY,Is that a lot?
3,0,0,SOLICITORBOT,"And to my loving nephew, Bender, assuming he's not responsible for my death, I leave my castle."
3,0,0,BENDER,Yes! Let's stay there tonight.
3,0,0,SOLICITORBOT,On condition that he spend one night within its walls.
3,0,0,BENDER,"Oh man, there's always a catch."
3,0,0,BENDER,"Ah! I got a good vibe from this place: Nice long dinner table, quiet, well-behaved spiders, graveyard-adjacent. Yep! It's gonna be -"
3,0,0,LEELA,What is it?
3,0,0,BENDER,"That painting, the eyes are watching me!"
3,0,0,FARNSWORTH,Hmm. It has motor eye sensors attached to motion detectors.
3,0,0,BENDER,"So does my butt, but I don't frame it and put it on the wall! Although... What's that?"
3,0,0,ZOIDBERG,"I don't know, but it's infectious!"
3,0,0,BENDER,"No doubt about it, this place is haunted."
3,0,0,HERMES,"Don't be silly mon, the last ghost died over 200 years ago."
3,0,0,BENDER,The last human ghost. But robot ghosts?
3,0,0,LEELA,0101100101. What does it mean?
3,0,0,BENDER,It's just gibberish. 1010011010?!
3,0,1,BENDER,Uncle Vladimir!
3,0,1,VLADIMIR-GHOST,"Come, Bender. You'll like being dead!"
3,0,1,BENDER,That's what they said about being alive.
3,0,1,ROBOT GHOSTS,"Join us! Join us! Join us, Bender!"
3,0,2,FARNSWORTH,"Just as I suspected. These robots were buried in improperly shielded coffins. Their programming leaked into the castles wiring through this old, abandoned modem allowing them to project themselves as holograms."
3,0,2,HERMES,Of course! It was so obvious!
3,0,2,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, that sequence of words I said made perfect sense. We really should tell Bender there's nothing to be afraid of."
3,0,3,BENDER,No!
3,0,3,FRY,"Bender, wake up! He's OK! Quick, does anyone have any liquor?"
3,0,3,LEELA,"Bender, what happened?"
3,0,3,BENDER,"Somebody tried to run me over. And not with a normal hover-car. It crept along the ground on round, rubber feet, like a wolf!"
3,0,3,FRY,"Poor Bender, you're seeing things. You've been drinking too much, or too little, I forget how it works with you. Anyway, you haven't drunk exactly the right amount."
3,0,3,AMY,"Maybe he's right, look at these tracks."
3,0,3,LEELA,I think Bender may be telling the truth.]
3,0,3,ZOIDBERG,"Bender, you look awful. I prescribe make-up. Here. It just so happens I have my Mary Kay sample case!"
3,0,3,BENDER,"Ah, I just need sleep. I had nightmares all night about cars running people over."
3,0,3,ZOIDBERG,"Many people dream of a fresh, new look. And Mary Kay can make those dreams come true."
3,0,3,LEELA,Look at this. They found those same rubbery tracks right here in New New York. There was a hit-and-run by the robot porno theatre.
3,0,3,BENDER,"Robot porno theatre? I was in that...general area, last night. Whoever ran me down on those moors must've followed me back here."
3,0,3,HERMES,"Bender mon, no one's trying to run you over. Stop being a big, hallucinating baby."
3,0,3,BENDER,"Yeah?! Could a big, hallucinating baby do this: I scared!"
3,0,3,VANDAL #1,I don't know which I like more: Smashing cars or smashing faces.
3,0,3,VANDAL #2,"Well. lucky you don't gotta decide tonight. No come on, we got church tomorrow. Did you hear something?"
3,0,3,VANDAL #1,"Ah, it was probably just a golden marmoset."
3,0,3,VANDAL #2,That don't sound like any golden marmoset I ever heard.
3,0,4,VANDAL #1,Made it!
3,0,4,VANDAL #2,"So anyway, what're you wearing tomorrow?"
3,0,5,BENDER,Where...? What the...? Transmission fluid? Where have I been? What happened?
3,0,5,SAL,"Get outta here, yous lazy bum!"
3,0,5,BENDER,"Please, I'm scared."
3,0,5,SAL,"We're all scared, it's the human condition. Why do you thinks I put on this tough-guy facade? Now beat it!"
3,0,5,BENDER,"I passed out around midnight, which is much earlier that usual, and when I woke up, I found these in my chest cabinet."
3,0,5,FRY,"Aw, relax buddy. You were probably just shooting some big, fuzzy craps."
3,0,5,BENDER,"No, I think I may have hurt someone. Oh Lord, I'm on the verge of a nervous meltdown."
3,0,5,FRY,"Geez Bender, you're scaring me. You're going wacko!"
3,0,5,BENDER,"You're right, I need professional help. And damn the expense."
3,0,5,BENDER,Damn the expense!
3,0,5,GYPSY,"My friend, you have nothing to worry about. Except a nightmare-ish life of unremitting horror!"
3,0,5,BENDER,Phew!
3,0,5,GYPSY,"For, you see, you are a were-car."
3,0,5,BENDER,A were-car?
3,0,5,GYPSY,The car that ran you down on the moors was also a were-car. It beamed a virus to you through its demonic headlights.
3,0,5,LEELA,That's crazy!
3,0,5,GYPSY,"Yes. So crazy that it must be true! Each midnight, when your clock resets to zero, your hardware reconfigures into a murderous, four-wheeled car."
3,0,5,BENDER,I can't keep running people over. I'm not famous enough to get away with it. Can't you help me?
3,0,5,GYPSY,Yes. But you must be willing to pay a terrible price.
3,0,5,BENDER,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
3,0,5,GYPSY,Follow me.
3,0,5,,[Gypsy's Caravan. She reads Curse Of The Were-Car. For Windows
3,0,5,GYPSY,"According to this ancient read-me file, your only hope is to destroy the original were-car."
3,0,5,BENDER,I'm with you.
3,0,5,GYPSY,"In its death throes, the dread car will beam out the virus's uninstall program, thus ridding you of the curse."
3,0,5,BENDER,"Otherwise, I can never die?"
3,0,5,GYPSY,Who said that? Sure you can die. You want to die?
3,0,5,BENDER,No! I wanna live! There's still too many things I don't own!
3,0,5,GYPSY,"Then live on, forever cursed. Each night, your attacks will become more gruesome until, one dark night you are doomed to kill your dearest friend."
3,0,5,FRY,I wouldn't wanna be me right now.
3,0,5,GYPSY,"Now go! Go! Uh, could one of you just...? Ah, forget it. I'll just sleep here."
3,0,5,LEELA,There. No rampaging for you tonight.
3,0,5,BENDER,Wouldn't it make sense to weld everyone except me to the wall?
3,0,5,LEELA,"Just relax, Bender. Tomorrow we'll pry you down, have a nice breakfast and then go hunt down and slaughter that ancient evil."
3,0,5,FRY,"It'll be a rich, full day."
3,0,5,LEELA,"Well, goodnight. I'm gonna go make my dinners for the next month and freeze them."
3,0,5,,"[The two part company. Above them, the huge digital clock displays"
3,0,9,FRY,"Bender, no!"
3,0,9,LEELA,"Fry, stay back!"
3,0,9,FRY,You jerk. I thought I was your best friend. What kind of two-timing kill-mobile are you?
3,0,10,FRY,"I can't believe this. Bender is supposed to murder his closest friend, which I thought was me. But he went straight for you. He didn't even try to second-degree murder me."
3,0,10,LEELA,Could you give me some help? I think Bender crushed my foot.
3,0,10,FRY,Stop rubbing it in.
3,0,10,BENDER,"Oh God. Fry, I'm so glad to see you. I didn't hurt you did I?"
3,0,10,FRY,"Not physically. But why don't you ask your new best friend, Leela?"
3,0,10,BENDER,I tried to run you over?
3,0,10,LEELA,"It was very sweet of you, Bender."
3,0,10,BENDER,"Fry, it doesn't mean anything. I have love enough for two."
3,0,10,FRY,"Words. Nothing sweet, sweet words that turn into bitter orange wax in my ears."
3,0,10,LEELA,"Enough with the feelings, you two. If we're gonna cure Bender we've got to go back to the castle and hunt down the original were-car."
3,0,10,FRY,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
3,0,10,LEELA,"Cursed, got it."
3,0,10,BENDER,Whatever.
3,0,10,LEELA,The tracks lead here.
3,0,10,FRY,"Thanks, eagle eye."
3,0,10,LEELA,"Now it's daylight, so he should be in robot form. But be careful. Many robots are stupid and violent."
3,0,10,BENDER,"I wish I was stupid and violent. Then we'd see what's what, I'd pound him till -"
3,0,10,YOKELBOT,"Get ye to your house, ye ignorant villagers."
3,0,10,LEELA,"We are not ignorant villagers, we're sophisticated New New Yorkers. Whup his butt!"
3,0,10,YOKELBOT,Stop! What are ye doing?
3,0,10,BENDER,"We're whaling on the original were-car, which is you, you jerk."
3,0,10,YOKELBOT,Ye think me be he?
3,0,10,SÃ­.,
3,0,10,YOKELBOT,"Nee. I mean, ""no"". I was given the curse many a year ago while on a bird-watching trip to the Arctic..."
3,0,10,YOKELBOT,
3,0,10,INUITBOT,"Yes, it's true. I ran over that bird-watching jerk and a hundred others. Even my best friend from aromatherapy school."
3,0,10,FRY,I once had a best friend who liked to smell things with me.
3,0,10,INUITBOT,"Alas, I'm afraid I'm not the original were-car. I received the curse while taking a learning annex class from a famous robot actor."
3,0,10,INUITBOT,You know him as Calculon.
3,0,10,CALCULON,"Oh, fate most cruel, would that my boundless acting skills would avail me a sword with which to slay this wretched curse."
3,0,10,BENDER,Let's kick him some more.
3,0,10,CALCULON,"No, wait, let me explain. It all began one fateful night a thousand years ago."
3,0,10,BENDER,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're a thousand years old? Your bio says you're 27!"
3,0,10,CALCULON,"Lies! I change my identity and upgrade my appearance every few decades to avoid suspicion. I was all of history's great acting robots: Acting Unit 0.8, Thespo-mat, David Duchovny!"
3,0,10,FRY,"Look, are you the original were-car or not?"
3,0,10,CALCULON,"No, but you are nearing the end of your search, for you see I was attacked by the original were-car."
3,0,10,BENDER,Give us a name MacButt!
3,0,10,CALCULON,"The year was 2019, and I was just a lowly robot arm..."
3,0,10,CALCULON,"...working in an automotive research lab. I was working on Project Satan......a savage, intelligent military vehicle built from the most evil parts of the most evil cars in all the world. The steering wheel from Hitler's staff car, the left-turn signal from Charles Manson's VW, the windshield from that car that played Knight Rider."
3,0,10,FRY,Knight Rider wasn't evil.
3,0,10,CALCULON,His windshield wipers were. It didn't come up much in the show though. Anyway...
3,0,10,CALCULON,"...Only after bringing Project Satan to life did they discover they had made a horrible mistake. For you see, it was pure evil."
3,0,10,LEELA,So what happened to Project Satan?
3,0,10,CALCULON,"It's either in Paris, or much more likely..."
3,0,10,CALCULON,...still in the abandoned automotive lab.
3,0,10,LEELA,You guys distract the were-car and I'll kill it by plugging its exhaust pipe with this silver potato.
3,0,10,BENDER,"Psst, there it is."
3,0,10,LEELA,It looks so unhappy. Excuse me? Are you Project Satan? Don't be afraid. We know what you are.
3,0,10,PROJECT SATAN,You do?
3,0,10,LEELA,Would you like us to...put you out of your misery?
3,0,10,PROJECT SATAN,Misery? What misery? I love killing people! Squishing them till their organs squirt out like chunky mustard.
3,0,10,BENDER,"Look, everyone love killing people, but I don't wanna hurt my friends."
3,0,10,LEELA,Oh no! It's midnight.
3,0,10,BENDER,"Hey, this is starting to feel pretty good!"
3,0,10,LEELA,"Fry, distract him."
3,0,10,FRY,"Hey, Project Satan! Over here! I'm a blind pedestrian. 20 points!"
3,0,10,LEELA,"Oh no, there's no exhaust pipe!"
3,0,10,PROJECT SATAN,"That's right, thanks to Ed Begley Jr.'s electric motor, the most evil propulsion system ever conceived! Take whichever one you want."
3,0,10,BENDER,"Oh boy, I feel like a car in a candy store!"
3,0,10,FRY,"Yes! He chose me! He's trying to kill me! Leela, I'm so happy! Oh, thanks Bender. Too tight! Too tight!"
3,0,10,LEELA,Whoa!
3,0,10,BENDER,Uh-oh.
3,0,10,LEELA,"Bender, you're cured! But what happened to Fry?"
3,0,10,BENDER,I must've killed him. He's my best friend and I killed him. I never felt so empty inside.
3,0,10,FRY,"Bender, I'm alive! You didn't hurt me at all. But I know you wanted to, and that's what matters. Here's to you."
3,0,10,BENDER,"Hey, that's my last beer, you bastard. I'll kill you!"
3,0,10,FRY,"I'll kill you too, buddy. I'll kill you too!"
