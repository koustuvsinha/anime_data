3,1,0,"""WAR IS THE H WORD""","By Eric Horsted Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
3,1,0,FRY,"Hm, Spider, Hubble, Nitrogum...ooh, Big Pink! It's the only gum with the breath-freshening power of ham."
3,1,0,BENDER,And it pinkens your teeth while you chew.
3,1,0,CLERK,"Alright, sergeant, $100 worth of pixie stix and porno mags with your 5% military discount comes to $95. That'll be 40 cents."
3,1,0,FRY,I believe you're forgetting about our 5% military discount.
3,1,0,CLERK,Well that's only for people in the military.
3,1,0,BENDER,What?! This is the worst kind of discrimination. The kind against me!
3,1,0,CLERK,"Alright, look. Our policy is, if for any reason you're not completely satisfied, I hate you."
3,1,1,BENDER,
3,1,1,FRY,"Full price for gum? That dog won't hunt, Monsignor."
3,1,1,BENDER,Hello. We're here because we...uh...love our planet!
3,1,1,MAN,"Sign here on the dotted line, patriots. Then I'll give you your discount cards."
3,1,1,FRY,"Just out of curiosity, we could use the cards to buy gum, then immediately quit the army, right?"
3,1,1,BENDER,"You know, playing you all for chumps?"
3,1,1,MAN,"Correct. There's no obligation. Unless, of course, war were declared."
3,1,1,FRY,What's that?
3,1,1,MAN,War were declared.
3,1,1,FARNSWORTH,"Now be careful, Fry. And if you kill anyone, make sure to eat their heart, to gain their courage. Their rich, tasty courage."
3,1,1,HERMES,I don't want you to worry about your jobs while you're away. That's why I'm firing you now.
3,1,1,LEELA,I wanna enlist. My friends always die if I'm not there to save them.
3,1,1,ZAPP,"Sorry, but the army's instituted a men-only policy."
3,1,1,LEELA,What?!
3,1,1,ZAPP,"It's shameful, I agree. In the olden days, I proudly fought alongside female troops, shoulder to, uh, shoulder. Alas, after a series of deadly blunders caused by distracting low-cut fatigues and lots of harmless pinching, the army decided women weren't fit for service. Not when I'm in charge."
3,1,1,LEELA,"You know, Zapp, someone ought to teach you a lesson."
3,1,1,ZAPP,"If it's a lesson in love, watch out. I suffer from a very sexy learning disability. What do I call it, Kif?"
3,1,1,KIF,Sex-lexia.
3,1,1,ZAPP,"Men, you're lucky men. Soon you'll all be fighting for your planet. Many of you will be dying for your planet. A few of you will be forced through a fine mesh screen for your planet. They will be the luckiest of all."
3,1,1,BENDER,"Great, we're gonna die."
3,1,1,FRY,And this ham gum is all bone.
3,1,1,ZAPP,"Now to present the logistics of our mission, the Commander-in-Chief. Please welcome the original Gerber Baby, Earth President Richard M. Nixon."
3,1,1,NIXON,"This is the brass ring, fellas......planet Spheron 1!"
3,1,1,FRY,Cool effect!
3,1,1,ZAPP,"It's a desolate, ugly little planet with absolutely no natural resources or strategic value. Questions?"
3,1,1,SOLDIER #1,Why is this godforsaken planet worth dying for?
3,1,1,ZAPP,"Don't ask me, you're the one who's going to be dying."
3,1,1,FRY,"Uh, just so we'll know, who's the enemy?"
3,1,1,ZAPP,"A valid question. We know nothing about their language, their history or what they look like. But we can assume this: They stand for everything we don't stand for. Also, they told me you guys look like dorks."
3,1,1,BENDER,They look like dorks!
3,1,1,ZAPP,"What's the matter, private? Tent got your tongue? Tent got your... Kif, write that down and send it to Humour In Uniform."
3,1,1,FRY,Whoa! Check out that guy. He makes Speedy Gonzales look like Regular Gonzales.
3,1,1,KIF,"That new recruit is phenomenal, sir."
3,1,1,ZAPP,"Yes. He edged out my old mark by two seconds......and 16 minutes...and 12 hours. I do plan to finish someday, Kif. Good hustle, soldier."
3,1,1,LEELA,"Uh, sorry, sir. I was still in attack mode. You know how testosterone is."
3,1,1,ZAPP,"As a bubbling Crock-Pot of male hormones, I sure do. What's your name, private?"
3,1,1,LEELA,"Lee -- ..la...man. La Man...Lemon! Lee Lemon, sir."
3,1,1,ZAPP,"Lemon, you're a man's man. You're a man's man's man. More importantly, your hand, while firm and masculine, is soft as a velvet child. What lotion do you use?"
3,1,1,LEELA,"Pert and Popular, sir."
3,1,1,ZAPP,"Roger that. Kif, get me ten cases of Pert and Popular."
3,1,1,KIF,"What shall I do with your Jergens, sir?"
3,1,1,ZAPP,Squirt it on some homeless man with dry elbows. Private Lee Lemon may well be the finest recruit I've seen in all my years of service. That young man fills me with hope and some other emotions that are weird and deeply confusing to me.
3,1,1,KIF,Ew.
3,1,1,ZAPP,Hello!
3,1,1,NIXON,"Mmm. Now that's a nice ros√©. So, anyway, we open up the panda crate, wouldn't you know it, the damn thing's dead! Up-chucked it's bamboo. True story."
3,1,1,ZAPP,"Uh-huh, uh-huh. That's whatever you were talking about for you."
3,1,1,FRY,Mind if we sit with you?
3,1,1,LEELA,"Uh, hey, why the hell would I? We're all guys here. Sweaty, hairy, gassy guys."
3,1,1,FRY,Good point...I guess.
3,1,1,BENDER,"You're my kind of soldier, Lemon. A foul-mouthed, barrel-chested, beer-bellied pile of ugly muscle."
3,1,1,HICK,So. Any you fellas got a special lady back home?
3,1,1,FRY,"Well, I sort of a have a thing for this girl I work with."
3,1,1,LEELA,"Really? What type is she? You know, blonde, or Chinese, or cyclops?"
3,1,1,FRY,Cyclops.
3,1,1,LEELA,"Aw, she sounds sweet."
3,1,1,BENDER,"But sweet girls aren't for you, eh? You hard-fighting, hard-farting, ugly, ugly son of a --"
3,1,1,LEELA,Stop! Stop flattering me!
3,1,1,ZAPP,"Ten hut! Well, well, well. If it isn't Lee Lemon. The flaming star of Brannigan's Rough Rangers. Say, uh, Lemon, do you like to read? I just got a great book on tape. It's about life in ancient Greece and --"
3,1,1,LEELA,"Sir, the alarm. I think I'd better --"
3,1,1,ZAPP,Shh. Don't talk. Just go.
3,1,1,NIXON,We are now in position above Spheron 1. This is the moment we were training for all yesterday afternoon.
3,1,1,ZAPP,"And now for the battle plan. As you all know, the key to victory is the element of surprise. Surprise!"
3,1,2,FRY,It's creepy here.
3,1,2,SOLDIER #1,This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.
3,1,2,FRY,And then the battle's not so bad?
3,1,2,SOLDIER #1,"Oh, right. I forgot about the battle."
3,1,2,FRY,What's happening?
3,1,2,HICK,Holy shoot! Looky!
3,1,2,FRY,The enemy! They're balls!
3,1,2,LEELA,"Charge your gun, Fry."
3,1,2,FRY,"Oh, right."
3,1,2,ZAPP,"Watch where you're shooting, private. You spooked Felicity. There, there, boy."
3,1,2,SOLDIER #1,Give this to my son.
3,1,2,BENDER,You got it!
3,1,2,SOLDIER #1,Wait. I didn't tell you where he lives.
3,1,2,BENDER,"Hey, I think your son might also like those boots."
3,1,2,HICK,"Cover us, buddy. You've got the only wounded-up positron shooter. Fry, you emu-bellied coward!"
3,1,2,FRY,Bender! No!
3,1,2,BENDER,"If they put me on a stamp, tell them to use the young Bender."
3,1,2,P.A. ANNOUNCER,"Incoming wounded. All operating personnel report to tent four, repeat, four. I mean five! Repeat, four."
3,1,2,NURSE,"Are you ready to operate, doctor?"
3,1,2,ZOIDBERG,"I'd love to, but first I have to perform surgery. I kid, I kid!"
3,1,2,ZOIDBERG,Scalpel. Blood bucket. Priest. Next patient.
3,1,2,IHAWK,"Gee, Zoidberg. Leave some for the enemy to kill."
3,1,2,NURSE,Leave Dr. Zoidberg alone. He has twice the training you do.
3,1,2,IHAWK,"Yeah, he's a doctor and a butcher!"
3,1,2,ZOIDBERG,"See, this is how it starts. First with he jokes, then comes the heavy stuff."
3,1,2,IHAWK,When will the killing end?
3,1,3,ZAPP,"Look at this sissy, Kif. While others were fighting and dying pointlessly, he was hiding in a hole, wallowing in a pool of his own cowardice."
3,1,3,FRY,That wasn't cowardice.
3,1,3,ZAPP,"I'm depromoting you, soldier. Kif, what's the most humiliating job there is?"
3,1,3,KIF,Being your assistant.
3,1,3,ZAPP,"Wrong! Being your assistant! Private Fry, you will henceforth serve as Kif's assistant."
3,1,3,FRY,That doesn't sound too bad.
3,1,3,KIF,"You speak when I tell you to, you filthy worm!"
3,1,3,ZOIDBERG,I'm afraid he's gone.
3,1,3,HICK,"Whoa, doc, I ain't dead."
3,1,3,ZOIDBERG,"Excuse me, I believe I'm the doctor."
3,1,3,IHAWK,"Believe it all you want, that won't make it true. This isn't a war, it's a murder. This isn't a war, it's a moider!"
3,1,3,HICK,"Bender, old buddy. Hang in there."
3,1,3,ZAPP,"Here lies the bravest soldier I've seen since my mirror got grease on it. I hereby order that in Bender's honour, he be melted down and made into a statue of himself."
3,1,3,NIXON,"Slow down there, Starsky, I'm up to something here. I want this robot fixed. Fixed like Kennedy fixed the 1960 election. Damn bean-eating war hero!"
3,1,3,NURSE,"Are you read to operate, doctor?"
3,1,3,IHAWK,"I'd love to, but first I have to perform surgery."
3,1,3,ZOIDBERG,That's my joke! I'll kill you!
3,1,3,ZAPP,"Ah! Pre-war scotch! Welcome, Lieutenant Bender. You're looking sharp."
3,1,3,BENDER,I got wheels! With clickety-clack-ers.
3,1,3,ZAPP,"Damnit, Kif, where's the little umbrella? That's what makes it a scotch-on-the-rocks!"
3,1,3,KIF,"Actually, sir --"
3,1,3,ZAPP,Make me a new one.
3,1,3,KIF,"Use a brush, you dunderhead! And mix these mixed nuts. I see two almonds touching!"
3,1,3,NIXON,"Now, listen here, Bender. This war is in danger of going all quagmire on me. So I'm sending you on one last mission."
3,1,3,BENDER,Hot diggidy daffodil!
3,1,3,NIXON,A mission of peace.
3,1,3,BENDER,Oh!
3,1,3,ZAPP,"You'll be negotiating with the aliens' mysterious leaders, the Brain Balls. They've got a lot of brains and they've got a lot of cutzpa!"
3,1,3,NIXON,"Accompanying you will be our top peace negotiator, Henry Kissenger."
3,1,3,KISSENGER,How are you?
3,1,3,BENDER,Is he any good?
3,1,3,NIXON,"Looking like that, he talked his way into Jill St. John's bed. Nuff said!"
3,1,3,NIXON,"I'm so dizzy, my head is spinning. Like a whirlpool it never ends."
3,1,3,ZAPP,A little lower. Lower. Lower. A lot lower. Too low...! Lower!
3,1,3,FRY,"I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh."
3,1,3,ZAPP,"Private Lemon, no need to leave. My stall just became free."
3,1,3,LEELA,"Maybe you should put on a towel, sir."
3,1,3,ZAPP,"Right. Right! I'm about to try the new lotion you recommended. If I should accidentally put too much on my hands, perhaps I could rub it onto you."
3,1,3,NIXON,Brannigan!
3,1,3,ZAPP,Hm?
3,1,3,NIXON,"My God, cover yourself. I didn't live a thousand years and travel a quadrillion miles to look at another man's gizmo."
3,1,3,ZAPP,"Uh, sorry, Mr. President, I didn't realise. Kif, raise him up about nipple-high."
3,1,3,NIXON,"Come on, Brannigan. Stuff yourself into a uniform. We've gotta get off this planet before the bomb goes off."
3,1,3,LEELA,Bomb?! What bomb?
3,1,3,ZAPP,The one we had the doctors implant in that gullible Bender robot.
3,1,3,NIXON,Zapp. Zapp!
3,1,3,ZAPP,Hm?
3,1,3,NIXON,Inspect the troops later. It's time to activate the bomb.
3,1,3,KISSENGER,"Now, as for economic cooperation --"
3,1,3,BENDER,Whoa! Scuse me.
3,1,3,P.A. ANNOUNCER,Attention: All personnel evacuate the planet immediately. And not just because it's meat loaf night.
3,1,3,ZAPP,"Come along, Lemon before this whole dump blows up."
3,1,3,LEELA,"Uh, commander? Could you tell me when the bomb is exploding?"
3,1,3,ZAPP,"Of course, my significant soldier. The bomb is voice activated. It will detonate the instant the robot unwittingly speaks a certain word."
3,1,3,FRY,What's the word...uh...sir?
3,1,3,ZAPP,"It's the one word the robot uses more than any other. We got it from this convenient database of his 10 most frequently-used words. Number 10, chump; number nine, chumpette; number eight, yours; number seven, up; number six, pimpmobile; number five, bite; number four, my......number three, shiny; number two, daffodil. And Bender's number one most frequently uttered word, the word which, if uttered, will blow up this entire planet: Ass."
3,1,3,FRY,We don't have long!
3,1,3,BRAIN BALL #1,"We demand bouncing, followed by rolling, followed by rolling of the third type."
3,1,3,KISSENGER,Say what?
3,1,3,BENDER,"My chair's too hard. It's a real pain in the...uh, whattya call it? Lower back! Yeah, that whole region."
3,1,3,FRY,
3,1,3,LEELA,Come on. We gotta save Bender.
3,1,3,FRY,"You wanna save him too, Lemon? You barely know him."
3,1,3,LEELA,"Fry, don't you recognise me?"
3,1,3,FRY,Hermes?
3,1,3,ZAPP,"Lee? When will I see you again? The two of you are good friends? But I thought we would be good friends. Well, let's see how friendly you get when you're sharing a prison cell!"
3,1,3,LEELA,"Hey, Zapp!"
3,1,3,ZAPP,Leela!
3,1,3,FRY,Leela!
3,1,3,ZAPP,"So it's you I've been attracted to! Oh, God, I've never been so happy to be beaten up by a woman."
3,1,3,LEELA,Let's do it again sometime.
3,1,3,BRAIN BALL #2,The elders tell of a young ball much like you. He bounced three metres in the air. Then he bounced 1.8 metres in the air. Then he bounced four metres in the air. Do I make myself clear?
3,1,3,KISSENGER,"Mr. Ambassador, our people tell the same story. Oy."
3,1,3,BENDER,"These balls are making me testy. If they don't stop bouncing and jiggling, I swear I'm gonna shove this treaty up their -- Wait a second. Where do you shove things up a ball?"
3,1,3,KISSENGER,This isn't a productive area of discussion.
3,1,3,LEELA,We're here. I followed the bouncing balls. I'll keep the chopper at a safe altitude while you parachute down.
3,1,3,FRY,
3,1,3,LEELA,I already did!
3,1,4,FRY,"Thank you! At last, war has made me into a man."
3,1,5,KISSENGER,"Please, gentlemen. We must put an end to the bloodshed. We have all seen too many body bags and ball sacks."
3,1,5,BRAIN BALL #1,We cannot condone bouncing of the seventh variety.
3,1,5,BENDER,Enough of this crap! I'm catching the next pimpmobile outta here! But before I go I have one thing to say. Bite my shiny metal --
3,1,5,FRY,Stop! You can't say the next word.
3,1,5,BENDER,"Up yours, chump, I said it 906 times before lunch."
3,1,5,FRY,"Bender, if you say the A-word and you'll blow this planet straight to the H-word!"
3,1,5,KISSENGER,"Young man, you have the bravery of a hero and breath as fresh as a summer ham. What? What is funny?"
3,1,5,BENDER,"Bender's got the upper hand now. The name of the game is ""Make Bender Happy Or He Blows Up The Planet"". I'd rather die and take everybody with me than sit here one more minute listening to these idiots talk about bouncing!"
3,1,5,BRAIN BALL #1,"Please, stay calm. There's no need to bounce of the handle."
3,1,5,BENDER,"That's it, I'm saying it! A is for --"
3,1,5,BRAIN BALL #1,"Wait, stop! We give in to all of Earth's demands. The war is over. Our home planet is yours."
3,1,5,FRY,"All right! Hey. Wait a minute! This is your home planet? We're the evil, invading aliens?"
3,1,5,BRAIN BALL #2,Correct.
3,1,5,BENDER,Then I guess you learned a valuable lesson: Don't mess with Earth.
3,1,5,BRAIN BALL #1,May you bounce in peace.
3,1,5,BENDER,Get the hell off my planet.
3,1,6,FARNSWORTH,"Well, that's it. Let's reactivate him. Wake up!"
3,1,6,BENDER,"Hey, chumps and chumpettes. Did you get the bomb out? Can I go back to saying the word I love to say?"
3,1,6,ZOIDBERG,I'm sorry but we couldn't remove it.
3,1,6,FARNSWORTH,It's stuck in there with glue or something. I don't know.
3,1,6,BENDER,"Well, this is just great! What's the point of living if I can't say ""ass""? Hey, I didn't blow up! Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass! Alright! I'm back in the saddle!"
3,1,6,LEELA,We couldn't disarm the bomb so we reset the word that triggers it.
3,1,6,AMY,It's from the list of words you almost never say.
3,1,6,BENDER,"That's using your ass. So, what's the word?"
3,1,6,HERMES,We think it's better if you don't know.
3,1,6,BENDER,"Oh, come on. I'm not gonna say it. Please? Oh, is it ""please""?"
3,1,6,FRY,No.
3,1,6,BENDER,"Hm, words I never say. Oh, I know! ""Thanks""!"
3,1,6,LEELA,"Bender, stop trying to destroy the world."
3,1,6,BENDER,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it ""sorry""? No. ""Funderful""? Uh, ""nonalcoholic""?"
3,1,6,AMY,Quit it!
3,1,6,FRY,Bender!
3,1,6,HERMES,"Stop it, mon!"
3,1,6,ZOIDBERG,Enough already!
3,1,7,BENDER,"""Compassion""? ""Shrimptoast""? ""Antiquing""? I'm alright!"
