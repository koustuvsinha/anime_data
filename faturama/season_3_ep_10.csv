3,10,0,"""THE CYBER HOUSE RULES""","By Lewis Morton Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
3,10,0,MORBO,"...So I gave the cookies to Fawn and the kids and they couldn't believe it -- they were delicious. But, I digress. Tremble, puny earthlings! One day my race will destroy you all!"
3,10,0,LEELA,Could one of you guys get that?
3,10,1,LEELA,"It's a doorbell baby! Hello, little guy. You know, I was abandoned as a baby too, so --"
3,10,1,BENDER,"Garbage, huh? I'll take care of it."
3,10,1,LEELA,"Bender, stop! It's a baby!"
3,10,1,BENDER,A baby what? Ow!
3,10,1,LEELA,"Oh, it's just a card -- from the orphanarium I grew up in."
3,10,1,CARD,"Leela, you're invited to reunion at Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium. Please stand clear of self-destructing basket."
3,10,1,BENDER,"A reunion at your old orphanarium, eh? You gonna go?"
3,10,1,LEELA,"No way, jose-bot. I never wanna see those other orphans again! Not after the way they used to pick on me."
3,10,1,KIDS,One-eye! One-eye! One-eye!
3,10,1,KIRK,"Nice depth-perception, one-eye!"
3,10,1,LEELA,"How can you make fun of me, Kirk? You're blind!"
3,10,1,KIRK,"My eyes may not work, but at least I got two of them!"
3,10,1,FRY,"Aww. That's terrible, Leela. But imagine the look on their faces when you show up with two friends who eat all the hors d'oeuvres."
3,10,1,LEELA,"Well, I wouldn't mind rubbing my success in a few choice faces."
3,10,1,BENDER,Set a course for adventure!
3,10,1,FRY,Eww!
3,10,1,BENDER,What a dump!
3,10,1,LEELA,Just like old times. Gosh. The bars on the windows seemed so much thicker back then. Mr. Vogel? Remember me?
3,10,1,VOGEL,Leela! You're worthless and no one will ever love you!
3,10,1,LEELA,You used to say that all the time!
3,10,1,VOGEL,"Oh, those were happier days."
3,10,1,FRY,Mmm! The gristle-in-a-blanket isn't half bad.
3,10,1,BENDER,Mmm! And try one of these Popsicle sticks. They've absorbed quite a bit of flavour.
3,10,1,LEELA,"Hey, look. It's our old group picture."
3,10,1,FRY,I don't see you anywhere.
3,10,1,LEELA,That's me over in Cootietown.
3,10,1,BENDER,Whoa! Get a load of this average-looking guy!
3,10,1,LEELA,That's Adlai Atkins. I used to have kind of a crush on him.
3,10,1,KIDS,One-eye! One-eye!
3,10,1,FRENCH GUY,Stupid as a French guy!
3,10,1,KIDS,One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye!
3,10,1,LEELA,"Well, it's time to say hello to the old gang."
3,10,1,MAN #1,"So, watcha been up to since you left the orphanarium?"
3,10,1,MAN #2,"Uh, living in a box, fighting the shakes. You?"
3,10,1,MAN #1,"Selling kidneys, teeth; whatever falls out of me."
3,10,1,LEELA,"And what am I up to, you ask? Well I'm a very successful space captain."
3,10,1,MAN #2,Oh.
3,10,1,MAN #1,Wow.
3,10,1,MAN #3,"How nice for you, Leela."
3,10,1,WOMAN,That's so good for a person with one eye.
3,10,1,LEELA,Hey! You can't feel sorry for me! I'm a space captain and you're all a bunch of losers.
3,10,1,MAN #1,"Uh, right, right. We're the losers!"
3,10,1,KIRK,"Well, if it isn't old one-eye!"
3,10,1,LEELA,"Oh, yeah? Well, shut up, cane boy!"
3,10,1,MAN #3,He can't hear you. He's deaf now.
3,10,1,ADLAI,"Leave Leela alone. She's leading a perfectly normal life. She's not gussied up, duded out, getting down or where it's at. Now, run along."
3,10,1,LEELA,"Thanks, Adlai. I guess you never really outgrow being an eyeball -- oddball!"
3,10,1,ADLAI,"Nonsense. You're a space captain. That's a fine, conventional profession."
3,10,1,LEELA,"Well, you know. It's just for a package delivery service."
3,10,1,ADLAI,Ah-ah. A package is just a box until it's delivered.
3,10,1,LEELA,Huh. I'd never thought of it that way. So what do you do these days?
3,10,1,ADLAI,"Oh, I'm a doctor."
3,10,1,LEELA,"A tall doctor, you say?"
3,10,1,VOGEL,"Sir, you seem pretty stable. Have you thought about adopting one of our kids?"
3,10,1,FRY,Sure haven't.
3,10,1,VOGEL,Well keep adoption in mind. It's a great way to have kids without having sex.
3,10,1,FRY,Really?
3,10,1,VOGEL,"Plus, the government will help out with a small stipend of $100 a week."
3,10,1,BENDER,$100 a week?
3,10,1,ADLAI,I'm so sorry I teased you back then. Let me make it up to you. I can fix it so that no one ever makes fun of you again.
3,10,1,LEELA,You mean by beating them up? Because I've broken that blind kid's nose like 10 times and it doesn't make any difference.
3,10,1,ADLAI,"No, I specialise in phaser eye surgery. I can build you a paraffin eye and graft it on with skin from your foot. It won't be able to see but you'll look like a perfectly normal two-eyed person."
3,10,1,LEELA,Me? Perfectly normal?
3,10,1,BENDER,"Sons, daughters, meet Uncle Fry."
3,10,1,FRY,"Hey, why are those kids following you? Do you have candy stuck to your ass?"
3,10,1,BENDER,"No. It's called parenting. Come on, dumplings. We've got 12 government stipends to collect."
3,10,1,KIDS,Yay!
3,10,1,BOY,Our daddy's a giant toy!
3,10,1,FARNSWORTH,Phaser eye surgery is a capital idea. I'm sure Leela's tired of morons gaping at her eye all the time.
3,10,1,AMY,"I think cosmetic surgery's great, Leela. I used to be too cute, so I had cuteness-reduction surgery here......and here."
3,10,1,FRY,You guys are crazy. Leela doesn't need surgery. You look great the way you are.
3,10,1,LEELA,"Oh, that's so sweet, Fry. But for once in my life, I just wanna look normal."
3,10,1,FRY,"But you're better than normal, you're abnormal. If you ask me, you shouldn't care what other people think."
3,10,1,LEELA,You're right! I'll start by not caring what you think! I'm getting the surgery.
3,10,1,FARNSWORTH,Thatagirl!
3,10,1,AMY,Right on!
3,10,1,ZOIDBERG,"Wonderful. And while you're under the knife, you could also get an ink pouch to help you escape your enemies."
3,10,1,FARNSWORTH,That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard you imbecile!
3,10,1,ADLAI,"Now we'll find out if the operation was a success. Hold on to your hats. Oh, I'm sorry, this is the wrong patient. Oops."
3,10,1,AMY,"Leela, those eyes look so great on you."
3,10,1,FRY,Bah! I think she looked fine before.
3,10,1,FARNSWORTH,No.
3,10,1,AMY,Uh-uh.
3,10,1,HERMES,Wrong.
3,10,1,LEELA,"Wow, look at me. Although I don't have the hang of blinking yet."
3,10,1,ADLAI,"You'll get it. Personally, I try not to blink too much because it seems flashy. But when I do, I enjoy it."
3,10,1,LEELA,I did it! I blunk!
3,10,1,HERMES,And just in time to screw up this picture I took!
3,10,1,LEELA,Hooray!
3,10,1,WALT,Ow!
3,10,1,IGNER,Ow!
3,10,1,LARRY,Ow!
3,10,1,LEELA,I've never felt so unremarkable! Today I actually blended in with a crowd!
3,10,1,BENDER,"Kids, meet the jerkbags I work with."
3,10,1,KIDS,"Hello, jerkbags!"
3,10,1,AMY,"Oh, they're so cute! What are their names?"
3,10,1,BENDER,Kids have names?
3,10,1,NINA,"My name's Nina, and his name's Albert"
3,10,1,BENDER,"And from now on, you're all named Bender Jr.! Looky here! My first government stipend cheque! 12 baby humans, 1200 wing-wangs!"
3,10,1,SALLY,"Daddy Bender, we're hungry."
3,10,1,BENDER,"What is it with you kids? Every other day, it's food, food, food! Oh, fine. I'll get you some stupid food."
3,10,1,ALBERT,Can we have Bender burgers again?
3,10,1,BENDER,No. The cat shelter's on to me!
3,10,1,ADLAI,"Hello, Leela. I was in a nearby tailor getting one of my Hawaiian shirts toned down, so I thought I'd drop in for your follow-up exam."
3,10,1,LEELA,That's so handsome of you.
3,10,1,ADLAI,"Just follow the light with your eyes. Perfect! You know, a guy could fall head-over-heels for a gal like you. As for me, I'm somewhat interested myself."
3,10,1,LEELA,What are you saying?
3,10,1,ADLAI,"I've never been good with words, which is why I'm in such a delicate conundrum. Will you go out with me this Sunday?"
3,10,1,LEELA,Sure!
3,10,1,ADLAI,"I don't know what else to say, so I'll just say it. Okey-dokey, see you then."
3,10,1,FRY,This is so unfair! I liked you back when you were a cyclops! That guy's only interested now that you have two eyes.
3,10,1,LEELA,You're just jealous!
3,10,1,FRY,"No, I'm not! Oh, wait, I am. But my point remains valid!"
3,10,1,LEELA,"Fry, I just wanna try dating a normal man, who if you go somewhere with him no one says he's crummy. I think I deserve that once in life."
3,10,1,ZOIDBERG,"Be careful with Adlai, Leela, he's a doctor, they're very poor."
3,10,1,LEELA,"Actually, most doctors are rich."
3,10,1,ZOIDBERG,"What? When did this happen? You're joking, right? That's not funny!"
3,10,1,BENDER,
3,10,1,ALBERT,Yeah.
3,10,1,BENDER,Then knock yourself out. Hey! Hey! Only eat enough to barely keep yourselves alive! I'm trying to make a profit here.
3,10,1,NINA,Daddy! Bethany's hitting me!
3,10,1,BENDER,Here.
3,10,1,FEMBOT,These kids yours?
3,10,1,BENDER,Yeah.
3,10,1,FEMBOT,Ooh. I'm attracted to a man with responsibility!
3,10,1,BENDER,"That's me, baby! Let me just ditch the kids in an alley and we can go have some fun."
3,10,1,BOY,Daddy Bender?
3,10,1,BENDER,"Son, daddy's trying to score with a cheap floozy right now, so we need you to cram a Tinkertoy in it!"
3,10,1,BOY,"I love you, Daddy Bender!"
3,10,1,BENDER,"Hey, what the hell are you doing? Quit hugging me!"
3,10,1,FEMBOT,I guess you're busy. I'll catch you later.
3,10,1,BENDER,You morons! I don't know what you're trying to pull here but I got half a mind to hug each and every one of you and see how you like it!
3,10,1,KIDS,Yay!
3,10,1,BENDER,"Oh, come on!"
3,10,1,ADLAI,I thought I'd take you someplace ordinary -- a place no one could object to.
3,10,1,LEELA,That sounds wonderful.
3,10,1,MAN,I'd like and extra-beautiful bouquet for my extra-gorgeous sweetheart.
3,10,1,ADLAI,"Average, please."
3,10,1,LEELA,"Oh, Adlai, I've had a wonderful time today. No one's stared at me or avoided staring at me or tried to burn me. You make me feel so not weird."
3,10,1,ADLAI,"Leela, you're 999,999 in a million!"
3,10,1,LEELA,Thanks for coming out to get to know my boyfriend. Isn't he dreamy?
3,10,1,ZOIDBERG,Totally.
3,10,1,ADLAI,"Uh, listen: I just want you all to know your Leela's one standard lady."
3,10,1,LEELA,"Oh, Adlai, stop!"
3,10,1,FRY,What's so wonderful about Leela being normal? The rest of us aren't normal and that's what makes us great. Like Dr. Zoidberg: He's a weird monster who smells like he eats garbage and does.
3,10,1,ZOIDBERG,Damn right!
3,10,1,FRY,"And the professor's a senile, amoral crackpot. Hermes is a Rastafarian accountant."
3,10,1,HERMES,Tally me banana.
3,10,1,FRY,Amy's a klutz from Mars.
3,10,1,AMY,Sploops!
3,10,1,FARNSWORTH,"And Fry, you've got that brain thing."
3,10,1,FRY,"I already did! So, Leela, do you wanna be like us? Or do you wanna be like Adlai with no severe mental or social problems whatsoever?"
3,10,1,LEELA,That's the dumbest question I ever heard!
3,10,1,FARNSWORTH,She's right!
3,10,1,ZOIDBERG,No doubt about it.
3,10,1,AMY,Duh!
3,10,1,HERMES,Daylight come!
3,10,1,BENDER,"Coming through, watch your heads!"
3,10,1,ZOIDBERG,Help! I'm under attack!
3,10,1,BENDER,"Remember your manners, kids. Forks go in the left pocket, spoons in the right."
3,10,1,ELZAR,Which one of you cutie muffins gets the children's spicy squab?
3,10,1,LITTLE BOY,Me!
3,10,1,BENDER,Ah-ah-ah! What do we say when someone gives you something?
3,10,1,LITTLE BOY,'Bout time!
3,10,1,BENDER,That's my boy!
3,10,1,ELZAR,And here's your check. Bam!
3,10,1,ALBERT,I gotta go poopy!
3,10,1,BENDER,"Well you should've gone poopy before it was time to run out on the check! C'mon! Go, go! Through the kitchen!"
3,10,1,ELZAR,You little crooks! If I catch you I'm going to make cutie-muffin gumbo!
3,10,1,ADLAI,"You know, seeing that strange robot force 12 children to do his bidding makes me think about kids of our own."
3,10,1,LEELA,Us? Me? You? Kids?
3,10,1,ADLAI,"That's correct. It's time to stop living this vida bachelor loca, settle down and have kids."
3,10,1,LEELA,"Oh, Adlai, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!"
3,10,1,ALBERT,"Daddy Bender, I want a piggy back ride."
3,10,1,BENDER,Daddy's tired. Let's just have another dog pile on Fry.
3,10,1,SALLY,"Tell us a story, Daddy Bender."
3,10,1,KIDS,Story! Story! Story!
3,10,1,BENDER,"Alright, fine, gather round."
3,10,1,NINA,We wanna hear this one again!
3,10,1,BENDER,"""Bender's Arrest Record"" by the police. On March 3rd at 2pm, Bender was caught shoplifting!"
3,10,1,ALBERT,"Yeah, show us the picture! There he is!"
3,10,1,BENDER,
3,10,2,BENDER,"Now to figure out how much money I'm raking in off those twerps! Oh, I need a calculator."
3,10,2,FRY,You are a calculator.
3,10,2,BENDER,"I mean a good calculator. Minus the food, the bunny rabbit wallpaper -- I'm getting 100 bucks a kid and they're costing 110!"
3,10,2,FRY,There goes my new kitchen cabinets.
3,10,2,BENDER,I'm not sitting through one more PTA meeting. The kids have got to go!
3,10,2,LITTLE BOY,"Daddy, how do I flush you?"
3,10,2,BENDER,Just go to bed!
3,10,2,ADLAI,"You know, doing this jigsaw puzzle of a pacifier factory makes me want to have children with you all the more."
3,10,2,LEELA,"Adlai, I was thinking. Since we're both orphans, maybe we should adopt a child."
3,10,2,ADLAI,"Adoption? Yes, that's acceptable. Heck, it's more than acceptable. It's adequately satisfactory!"
3,10,3,BENDER,"Hello? Imperial Dragon Restaurant? I've got a herd of you-know-whats for sale...Let me check. Oh, aren't you a cutie? About 35lbs. What?!"
3,10,3,LEELA,"Hi, Bender. We'd like to adopt a child."
3,10,3,BENDER,"Well, you've come to the right place because Honest Bender's Orphanarium means discount orphans. Now, little lady. What do I have to do to send you home with 12 orphans today?"
3,10,3,ADLAI,"Uh, I'm afraid we only want one."
3,10,3,BENDER,"Whatever you say, chief. I'll show you what I got in stock."
3,10,3,LEELA,I remember this from when we were kids: The warden would trot you out in front of prospective parents and they'd judge you like a piece of meat.
3,10,3,ALBERT,I'm Albert.
3,10,3,LEELA,Kind of fatty.
3,10,3,BENDER,Then how about this little number? Pure-bred human. No vampire in there.
3,10,3,LEELA,"Uh, um."
3,10,3,ADLAI,Hmm.
3,10,3,BENDER,"If you're strapped for cash, you might wanna consider this irregular unit. Cursed with a third ear but so full of that emotion that I understand is called ""love""."
3,10,3,SALLY,"One time, I did a hundred jump ropes."
3,10,3,LEELA,"Oh, I can't decide. We're gonna have to think about it."
3,10,3,BENDER,
3,10,3,ALBERT,But it's 10 in the morning!
3,10,3,BENDER,I said hit the hay!
3,10,4,LEELA,"Oh, they're all so adorable."
3,10,4,BENDER,"Yeah. You know, it's times like this I can hardly bear to let them go. Goodnight, you princes of Maine, you kings of New New England."
3,10,4,SMITTY,"You're under arrest for child cruelty, child endangerment, depriving children of food, selling children as food and misrepresenting the weight of livestock."
3,10,4,LEELA,"Officer, would it be alright if we adopted one of the kids?"
3,10,4,SMITTY,Might as well. They're just gonna rot in the evidence locker.
3,10,4,KID #1,Nice ear!
3,10,4,KID #2,"Hey, freaky ears!"
3,10,4,KID #3,How's you ear?
3,10,4,LEELA,I've made up my mind. Let's adopt her.
3,10,4,ADLAI,Her? But there's plenty of normal ones.
3,10,4,LEELA,"Come on, Adlai. She could really use a mom and dad."
3,10,4,KIDS,Ear-face! Ear-face! Sally won the ugly race!
3,10,4,ADLAI,"On the other hand, the children bring up a good point. She does have an ear on her face."
3,10,4,LEELA,Well? So what? She may be different but she still deserves a good home.
3,10,4,ADLAI,"Oh, alright. If you really want that one, I can give her an operation to make her acceptable."
3,10,4,LEELA,She doesn't need an operation! She's fine the way she is!
3,10,4,ADLAI,"Oh, and I suppose you were fine the way you were?"
3,10,4,LEELA,Damn right I was!
3,10,4,FRY,Yay!
3,10,4,LEELA,"Shut up, Fry. Now look, Adlai. I'm proud to be different. And I just wished I'd realised that when I was her age."
3,10,4,SALLY,I also have a tail!
3,10,4,LEELA,Now take me to the hospital and put my eye back the way it was. Right now!
3,10,4,ADLAI,Why should I do that?
3,10,4,LEELA,"Listen, buddy. By the end of the day, one of us is going to have one eye."
3,10,4,VOGEL,"In recognition of Bender's generous gift of 12 orphans and a government cheque for 1200 wing-wangs, I hereby rename this building the Bender B. Rodriguez Orphanarium!"
3,10,4,FRY,It's good to have the old weird-looking Leela back.
3,10,4,LEELA,"Aww! You're a true friend, Fry. I guess there's nothing wrong with being a little weird."
3,10,4,FRY,"Leela, there's nothing wrong with anything."
3,10,4,ALBERT,"We'll miss you, Daddy Bender."
3,10,4,NINA,We know robots don't have emotions but we drawed you this picture!
3,10,4,SALLY,"So if you ever miss us, even just a teeny bit, you can look at it."
3,10,4,BENDER,"Hey, I smoke a cigar, not a candy cane. Sheesh! Hey, what the? Get away! Come on! I just got all the gum off of there! Hey! Hey! I hate you! I hate you all!"
