3,11,0,"""INSANE IN THE MAINFRAME""","By Bill Odenkirk Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
3,11,0,ANNOUNCER,Futurama is brought to you by ... ... Thompson's Teeth: The only teeth strong enough to eat other teeth.
3,11,0,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, everyone! Today marks our dear friend Dr. Zoidberg's 10th year with Planet Express. Huzzahs are in order."
3,11,0,FRY,Huzzah!
3,11,0,LEELA,Huzzah!
3,11,0,AMY,Huzzah!
3,11,0,ZOIDBERG,Hooray for me! Hooray for Zoidberg!
3,11,0,HERMES,"I will now read the mandatory speech. Dear employee: Has it really been five, 10 or 15 years? If not, please disregard this and get back to work. Distribute token of appreciation and applaud."
3,11,0,ZOIDBERG,"Look! Coupons! I can get two oil changes for the price of one! Now if I could only afford the one ... and the car. Ah, the years! So many memories, so many strange fluids gushing out of patients' bodies--"
3,11,0,HERMES,"Yes, yes. Now here's your pension statement. It's empty because you haven't paid into it, you dumb stinkbug!"
3,11,0,ZOIDBERG,You kept track of it all these years!
3,11,0,FRY,"Oh, no, I'm boned! I haven't paid into the pension either. What'll I do when I retire?"
3,11,0,BENDER,I thought you were retired.
3,11,0,FRY,"Hey, I don't see you planning for your old age."
3,11,0,BENDER,"I got plans. I'm gonna turn my on/off switch to ""off""."
3,11,0,FRY,Well I'm gonna take action. It's time to check on my retirement fund. Damn! Still only $100.
3,11,0,FRANKLIN,"A penny saved is a penny earned. Also, could you get some athlete's foot cream for my face?"
3,11,0,FRY,He's right! I've gotta start investing wisely.
3,11,0,FRY,"Well, I'm down to my last lottery ticket. Cherry. Cherry! Mule. Crud!"
3,11,0,BENDER,"So, you got six bucks left to retire on. I recommend Tender Vittles."
3,11,0,TELLER,You're opening a retirement account for $6? I'm sure a wealthy ... ... mule farmer like yourself is aware that we charge a $10 monthly fee.
3,11,0,FRY,You gotta spend money to make money.
3,11,0,TELLER,"Here you are, sir. Your account is now overdrawn by $4."
3,11,0,ROBOT,"Gee, I've seen lines move faster in a sperm bank."
3,11,0,BENDER,That's for sure-- Roberto! Is that you?
3,11,0,ROBERTO,"Bender! Hey, man!"
3,11,0,BENDER,You old lunatic! How you been?
3,11,0,ROBERTO,"Not bad, not bad. Everybody on the floor! This is a stick-up!"
3,11,0,BENDER,"Yeah, I'm doing OK too. I'm taking a Chinese cooking class at the Learning Annex."
3,11,0,ROBERTO,Cool. Ca-Can you give me a hand here?
3,11,0,BENDER,"Sure thing, pal."
3,11,0,ROBERTO,"Hey, you! Red! Quit watering that plant and get the door!"
3,11,0,BENDER,"Well, nice talking to you."
3,11,0,ROBERTO,Same here. You guys are alright! Here's something for your trouble.
3,11,1,BENDER,"Hey, thanks, buddy!"
3,11,2,SMITTY,"Freeze, punks! You're under arrest!"
3,11,2,NIXON,Shoot them in the back! Quick! While they're not looking!
3,11,2,BAILLIF,Court is in session. The Honourable Judge Whitey presiding.
3,11,2,WHITEY,"The charge is bank robbery. Now, my caddie chauffeur informs me that a bank is a place where people put money that isn't properly invested. Therefore, robbing a bank is tantamount to that most heinous of crimes: Theft of money!"
3,11,2,HYPER-CHICKEN,"As the surveillance camera for the bank what all the judge was a-jawing about, could ya'll tell us what you done seen the day of the crime?"
3,11,2,CAMERA,"Well, let's see. My memory's a little fuzzy, but it went exactly like this:"
3,11,2,HYPER-CHICKEN,"Your Honour, I move that I be disbarred for introducing this evidence against my own clients."
3,11,2,HYPER-CHICKEN,"Mr. Fry, do you recognise the robot a-huggin' on you in this here hologram?"
3,11,2,FRY,I sure do! That's the real robber and I'll never forget his name as long as I live. And that name is--
3,11,2,LEELA,Fry! Just give a name. You don't wanna look stupid on Court TV!
3,11,2,FRY,You're right. You're right. It was--
3,11,2,WHITEY,Yes? What? You say if I testify I'll be killed? Oh. It's for you.
3,11,2,ROBERTO,...and the other hamburger will...
3,11,2,ROBERTO,"...also be made of your lungs. So long, pal."
3,11,2,FRY,I refuse to testify on the grounds that my organs will be chopped up into a patt√©.
3,11,2,WHITEY,"Ah, the 67th Amendment."
3,11,2,HYPER-CHICKEN,I may be a simple country Hyper-Chicken but I know when we're finger-licked. Whattya say we plead insanity?
3,11,2,BENDER,A few months in an insane asylum? I could do that standing on my head.
3,11,2,HYPER-CHICKEN,"If you start now, it might help our case."
3,11,2,WHITEY,"Counselor, what evidence do you offer to support this new plea of insanity?"
3,11,2,HYPER-CHICKEN,"Well, for one, they done hired me to represent them."
3,11,2,WHITEY,"Insanity plea is accepted. Mr. Bender, I hereby commit you to the asylum for criminally insane robots until such time as you are deemed cured."
3,11,2,BENDER,Yahoo! The system fails again!
3,11,2,WHITEY,"And, Mr. Fry, I sentence you to the home for criminally insane humans."
3,11,2,BAILIFF,"Your Honour, that facility has been full ever since you ruled that being poor is a mental illness."
3,11,2,WHITEY,Order! Order! The only poor people I want to hear about are the people who tend to my pores at the spa. Just send them both to the robot loony bin and let's go.
3,11,2,FRY,Ow! My head! Ow! My feet! Ow! My head! Ow! My feet!
3,11,2,FARNSWORTH,Keep your chin up!
3,11,2,FRY,Ow! My chin!
3,11,2,FRY,"I don't belong here, Bender. This is an asylum for insane robots!"
3,11,2,BENDER,"Well, you meet half the qualifications."
3,11,2,FRY,"Oh, good, a physical! Once they examine my fragile, naked, pink body, they'll see I'm not a--"
3,11,2,FRY,What the--?
3,11,2,BENDER,I find that offensive!
3,11,2,DR. PERCEPTRON,Greetings. I am Dr. Perceptron. Let me give you something to help you relax.
3,11,2,FRY,"Look! There's been a terrible mistake. I'm a human being. See? I'm all squishy and flabby. Also, I complain a lot."
3,11,2,DR. PERCEPTRON,"Yes, you do. You need to relax more. Terrific. Now, consider the following: You were admitted to this robot asylum. Therefore, you must be a robot. Diagnosis complete."
3,11,2,FRY,I do other human stuff! I age! See?
3,11,2,NURSE RATCHET,"I'm Nurse Ratchet. Please come with me, won't you?"
3,11,2,NURSE RATCHET,"We'll meet your roommate next, shall we? His name is Malfunctioning Eddie."
3,11,2,FRY,The car dealer? Wow! I guess his prices really were insane.
3,11,2,NURSE RATCHET,He's very excitable. So don't say anything to excite him.
3,11,3,MALFUNCTIONING EDDIE,Pleased to meet you.
3,11,3,FRY,"Actually, we've met once before."
3,11,3,MALFUNCTIONING EDDIE,What?
3,11,3,HAIRBOT,I'm a pretty girl. I'm a pretty girl. I'm a pretty girl.
3,11,3,BENDER,Whoa! Someone had a busy day.
3,11,3,FRY,"My roommate exploded. Oh, you gotta help me, Bender. How can I prove I'm human?"
3,11,3,BENDER,You could drop dead. That'd show 'em.
3,11,3,FRY,I don't wanna!
3,11,3,UNIT 2013,"Hey, man. I believe you're a human."
3,11,3,FRY,You do?
3,11,3,UNIT 2013,"Sure. They don't believe I'm a human either. Name's Unit 2013. C'mon. Lemme introduce you around. Fry, meet Norm. How's it going, pal? Still picking up transmissions from the CIA on your teeth?"
3,11,3,NORM,They just won't stop!
3,11,3,WOMAN,"The CIA cafeteria menu for the week of May 15th is as follows: Monday, shepherd's pie. Tu--"
3,11,3,UNIT 2013,Cuckoo!
3,11,3,FRY,Let me guess: He thinks he's Lincoln?
3,11,3,UNIT 2013,"Well, he's supposed to. Problem is he's got multiple personalities; all of them Lincoln."
3,11,3,LINCOLNBOT,I was born in 200 log cabins.
3,11,3,UNIT 2013,"And this here is Frankie. He's convinced he's a lunchroom worker, so they put him to work in the lunchroom. How is work in the lunchroom, Frankie?"
3,11,3,FRANKIE,It's alright.
3,11,3,UNIT 2013,Poor Frankie!
3,11,3,MAD HATTERBOT,Change places!
3,11,3,FRY,"Bender, I can't take much more of this! I want outta here!"
3,11,3,BENDER,"Are you crazy? This place is great! Electroshock whenever you want it, two Lincolns for every Napoleon. Ah! Sweet light crude!"
3,11,3,FRY,But I'm not a robot like you. I don't like having discs crammed into me. Unless they're Oreos - and then only in the mouth! Don't you understand? I'm gonna die here!
3,11,3,BENDER,"Ah, quit your bellyaching and take it like a robot."
3,11,3,MAD HATTERBOT,Change places!
3,11,3,VICTOR,The doctor says you are making great strides with your exploding problem.
3,11,3,MALFUNCTIONING EDDIE,Well the way I see it=--
3,11,3,FRY,You gotta get me out of here. I would have starved to death if not for that sick vending machine robot. Gimmie! Gimmie!
3,11,3,HERMES,Poor Fry! He's got the munchies for freedom!
3,11,3,LEELA,We're all trying to help you. We've petitioned the governor but he doesn't want to appear soft on people who've been falsely imprisoned.
3,11,3,FRY,At least I have friends on the outside. Bender's been no help at all.
3,11,3,BENDER,"Je suis Napoleon! No, seriously, I'm not."
3,11,3,AMY,Bender! You should be more ashamed of yourself than usual.
3,11,3,BENDER,"Ah, lighten up, honey. I'm just trying to get through a difficult time using humour."
3,11,3,NURSE RATCHET,Visiting hours are over. Time for our medication disks.
3,11,3,FRY,"Help me! For God's sake, help me!"
3,11,3,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, don't worry, Fry. I too once spent a nightmare-ish time in a robot asylum. But now it's nearly over. So long."
3,11,3,FRY,"Thirty days hath September, April, June and ... wonder ... is that peanut butter ... what am I gonna do? Oh, God! What? What? What is it now?"
3,11,3,DR. PERCEPTRON,You are being released.
3,11,3,FRY,"Finally! Sweet justice! Sweet, juicy justice!"
3,11,3,DR. PERCEPTRON,Not you. Him.
3,11,3,MALFUNCTIONING EDDIE,Me? What a surprise. Look!
3,11,4,MALFUNCTIONING EDDIE,I barely exploded at all.
3,11,4,DR. PERCEPTRON,We can control that with medication.
3,11,4,NURSE RATCHET,Fry? Are we ready to meet our new roommate?
3,11,5,ROBERTO,"Hi, Red!"
3,11,5,FRY,Roberto! W-W-W-What are you doing here?
3,11,5,ROBERTO,I got busted robbing that bank again.
3,11,5,FRY,Why would you hold up the same bank twice?
3,11,5,ROBERTO,"Ah, that first time was just to case the joint and rob it a little. What's the matter? You scared?"
3,11,5,FRY,
3,11,5,ROBERTO,"Noticeably? I'll say! Now stand back, I gotta practice my stabbing."
3,11,5,FRY,No! Please! Help! Stop it! Please!
3,11,5,BENDER,Hey! Keep it down in there! I'm tuning my banjo!
3,11,5,ROBERTO,"Jeez, Red. Quit cowering. You call yourself a robot?"
3,11,5,FRY,I'm not a robot! I'm not a robot!
3,11,5,DR. PERCEPTRON,"In answer to your question, Hermes, yes, your friend is cured."
3,11,5,HERMES,Oh!
3,11,5,FARNSWORTH,What a relief!
3,11,5,LEELA,Thank God!
3,11,5,DR. PERCEPTRON,You'll notice he no longer suffers delusions of humanity.
3,11,5,FRY,"Affirmative. I feel nothing. I am a robot. Beep, beep, beep"
3,11,5,LEELA,"You've made a terrible mistake. He's a human being, not a machine. Oh, Fry!"
3,11,5,BENDER,"Gonna sing a little tale about a battle called Waterloo. Bonjour, y'all!"
3,11,5,ZOIDBERG,"Listen to me, Fry. Just because you think you're a robot, doesn't make you a robot. After all, I think I'm a doctor but that doesn't make me a doctor. These fancy clothes do!"
3,11,5,FRY,Negative. I must be a robot. Why else would human women refuse to date me?
3,11,5,LEELA,"Oh, lots of reasons."
3,11,5,FRY,"Bio-units, terminate noise exchange. It is time for you to ingest sandwiches from my compartment."
3,11,5,BENDER,Here we go. Just a minute. Aha!
3,11,5,COMMENTATOR,"And down the stretch, it's Daddy's Little Grandpa, followed by Perennial Loser, and bringing up the rear, it's Lasty!"
3,11,5,BENDER,"Come on, Lasty!"
3,11,5,ROBERTO,"Hey, Bender."
3,11,5,BENDER,"Roberto! Ooh, what a surprise to see you in here! Especially 'cause I didn't squeal on you, remember? Remember all that squealing I didn't do? Remember? Do ya?"
3,11,5,ROBERTO,"Yeah, yeah. Now lie down and play dead. And don't ham it up!"
3,11,5,BENDER,"Uh, sure. Anything for you, buddy."
3,11,5,ROBERTO,"Wait here, Bender. I need to get a disguise."
3,11,5,BENDER,"Uh, what's with the get-up?"
3,11,5,ROBERTO,I'm in disguise 'cause I'm thinking of escaping. You in? Or do I gotta kill ya so you don't squeal?
3,11,5,BENDER,I'm in! I'm in! So when were you planning the breakout?
3,11,5,ROBERTO,I'm thinking maybe a few seconds ago.
3,11,5,BENDER,Quick! Let's keep escaping!
3,11,7,HERMES,"Times two, carry the one ..."
3,11,7,FRY,"Oh, you sad, worthless human."
3,11,7,HERMES,What are ya--? Sacred hog of Prague! That was my anniversary gift to LaBarbara!
3,11,7,FRY,Fear not! For I shall assist ye!
3,11,7,HERMES,"Robots don't say ""ye""!"
3,11,7,FRY,"Relax, mammal. My robotic software shall meet your calculatory needs. What is the meaning of this symbol?"
3,11,7,HERMES,"That's a plus sign, you pointy-haired loony! Quit thinking you're a robot!"
3,11,7,FRY,I'll show ye!
3,11,7,FRY,Stand back. I'm a tool-bot.
3,11,7,LEELA,You're not a tool-bot. You're not a food-motron. You're not a robot of any kind.
3,11,7,FRY,"Yes, I am. I simply haven't discovered my primary function yet."
3,11,7,LEELA,
3,11,7,FARNSWORTH,You're going to do his laundry?
3,11,7,LEELA,"Fry, this is for you."
3,11,7,FRY,Beep.
3,11,7,LEELA,"Oh, for God's sake!"
3,11,7,ZOIDBERG,"By a scallop's forelocks! What's with all the beer, Fry?"
3,11,7,FRY,"Alcohol fuels my power cells. And as a mighty robot, I-- Beep."
3,11,7,ROBERTO,"Thanks for helping me escape, Bender."
3,11,7,BENDER,"Oh, it was nothing."
3,11,7,ROBERTO,It was not nothing! I wanna repay you. Let me get you something in here.
3,11,8,ROBERTO,Hands up! This is a stick-up again!
3,11,8,BENDER,"Wow! Hitting the same place three times? I admire your style, Roberto."
3,11,8,ROBERTO,Gimmie the remaining dough. And the calendars ... and that pen. Try to tear it so most of the beads are on my end!
3,11,8,URL,Police! You're busted!
3,11,8,SMITTY,And don't try anything. This glass here is laser-proof. Fire lasers! Duck! Lasers!
3,11,8,BENDER,Come on! I got a place where I like to hide after crimes.
3,11,8,AMY,Aw! He looks like a little insane drunken angel.
3,11,8,BENDER,"Hey, everybody. Meet my good pal, Roberto."
3,11,8,HERMES,"Hey, mon."
3,11,8,ROBERTO,Nice to meet you.
3,11,8,SMITTY,Come out with your hands up.
3,11,8,ROBERTO,Hostages!
3,11,8,ROBERTO,Back off! I got hostages!
3,11,8,ZOIDBERG,Hooray! I'm helping!
3,11,8,SMITTY,Do you have any better hostages?
3,11,9,ROBERTO,"To show them who's crazy, I'm gonna execute some of you. How 'bout you?"
3,11,9,FARNSWORTH,Ouch! That's going to bleed when my heart beats.
3,11,9,LEELA,Wait! Take me first!
3,11,9,BENDER,Yes! Take her first.
3,11,9,ROBERTO,Shut up! Stop telling me how to do this!
3,11,9,ZOIDBERG,"Oh, the fear!"
3,11,9,ROBERTO,I'm thinking of a number between one and ten. Guess it and you die first. Go!
3,11,9,BENDER,Um ... OK. Fixty ... six ... ish?
3,11,9,ROBERTO,"56? 56? Oh, man! Now that's all I can think about! I'm gonna kill you, you ... no good ... 56-ing--"
3,11,9,BENDER,Don't kill me yet! I'm starting to come down with Stockholm syndrome ... handsome!
3,11,9,FRY,"Halt, fellow robot!"
3,11,9,ROBERTO,"Hey, Red. You're just in time to join the hostage situation. Which side you wanna be on?"
3,11,9,FRY,"The side that kicks your twisted, metal ass!"
3,11,9,LEELA,Fry! Stay back. He's too powerful.
3,11,9,FRY,"Negative, bossy meat creature. I know now what my primary function is: I am a battle-droid. Sworn to protect the weak from crazy robots."
3,11,9,ROBERTO,I'm not crazy! Don't call me crazy! I'm just not user-friendly!
3,11,9,HERMES,Fry! Don't be a hero! It's not covered by the health plan!
3,11,9,ROBERTO,Let's see how much of a robot you really are!
3,11,9,FRY,No knife can penetrate my skin-tanium armour.
3,11,9,ROBERTO,"Help! Help! He is a battle-droid! Somebody help me! Mommy! I'm sorry I spilled the transmission fluid, Mommy! No! No! Don't weld me to the wall, Mommy!"
3,11,10,SMITTY,We're willing to listen to your demands.
3,11,10,URL,"Hey, baby. Wash that off before you put it back."
3,11,11,HERMES,Who's brave now?
3,11,11,AMY,Hooray!
3,11,11,ZOIDBERG,Bravo!
3,11,11,LEELA,"You did it, Fry."
3,11,11,BENDER,"Congratulations, buddy. You're a credit to my race."
3,11,11,FRY,"It was nothing. I-- Blood? Robots don't have blood. I must be a, a--"
3,11,11,ZOIDBERG,A squid?
3,11,11,FRY,"A human! Oh, my God! I'm a human!"
3,11,11,ZOIDBERG,Also good.
3,11,11,LEELA,"Thanks for saving us, Fry."
3,11,11,FRY,I'm gonna continue never washing this cheek again.
3,11,11,BENDER,"Buddy, you may be wrapped in greasy skin, but inside, you've got the heart of a robot."
3,11,11,FRY,"Aw. Thanks, Bender."
3,11,11,BENDER,"Just like inside me, I've got the heart of a human. What?"
3,11,11,BENDER,What?
