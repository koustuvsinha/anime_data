3,12,0,"""BENDIN' IN THE WIND""","By Eric Horsted Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
3,12,0,BENDER,"Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, uh-huh, uh-huh"
3,12,0,FRY,Oh my God! They dug up a bag of olestra chips from my time! There must be layers and layers of old stuff down there.
3,12,0,BENDER,What's that? One of those Led Zeppelins I've heard so much about?
3,12,0,FRY,"No, it's an old Volkswagen van. Hey, Mister? Mind if I take this old van?"
3,12,0,SAL,"Sure. You wanna dump the corpses out of theres, it's yourses."
3,12,0,FRY,"Yeah yeah, I've gotten used cars before."
3,12,0,LEELA,What's that? One of those Jefferson Starships I've heard so much about?
3,12,0,FRY,"It's called a van, and in light of the fact that it's not a-rockin', I invite you to come a-knockin'!"
3,12,0,AMY,"Wow, neat."
3,12,0,HERMES,It's a triumph of free-spirited German engineering.
3,12,0,AMY,"Hey, the speedometer only goes up to 80. This thing can't go faster than 80,000 miles an hour?"
3,12,0,FRY,"No, it can't, but it's got a driver's-side floor and an 8-track player with genuine mono sound."
3,12,0,FARNSWORTH,Where's the device that lets you speed or slow the passage of time?
3,12,0,FRY,Under the seat.
3,12,0,LEELA,Why won't it start?
3,12,0,FRY,It just needs some gas.
3,12,0,FARNSWORTH,"Wrong again, idiot. There is no gas. Petroleum reserves ran dry in 2038."
3,12,0,LEELA,"Gas was an environmental disaster, anyway. Now we use alternative fuels."
3,12,0,FRY,Like what?
3,12,0,LEELA,"Whale oil. Bender, lift it up to the can opener."
3,12,0,BENDER,"Oh, no, I'm not going near it. Last time, that magnetic psycho nearly cut my head off."
3,12,0,FRY,"Oh, right. Plus, the magnet screws up your inhibition unit and makes you sing folk songs."
3,12,0,BENDER,What? Who said anything about me secretly wanting to be a folk singer? How ridiculous.
3,12,0,FRY,"Bender, if you don't open that can right now, your fear will own you, and nothing that can opener could ever do could be worse than that."
3,12,0,BENDER,
3,12,0,LEELA,Come on.
3,12,0,HERMES,You can do it.
3,12,0,AMY,Bender!
3,12,0,FARNSWORTH,"Go on, you dummy."
3,12,0,BENDER,Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care
3,12,0,FRY,"Oh, no!"
3,12,0,BENDER,'Cause the master's gone away.
3,12,0,ZOIDBERG,It's toe-tapping-ly tragic.
3,12,0,BENDER,"Doc, I can't move my arms and legs. What's wrong with me?"
3,12,0,DOCTOR,This is the worst part of the job.
3,12,0,BENDER,"What is it, good news?"
3,12,0,DOCTOR,"Bender, your hydraulics are shot. You'll never move again."
3,12,0,BENDER,You mean -?
3,12,0,DOCTOR,"I'm sorry, you'll have to get a new one."
3,12,0,FRY,"Oh, no, this is terrible."
3,12,0,ZOIDBERG,Poor Bender.
3,12,0,FARNSWORTH,"Well, let's drag him to the kerb."
3,12,0,FRY,"Wait a minute, Bender is my best friend. We can't just dump him in the gutter like Grandma's ashes."
3,12,0,BENDER,"Oh, my life is over. I'll never know happiness again."
3,12,0,ROBOT,"Ho ho, hello there!"
3,12,0,LEELA,"Look, Bender. It's Patch Cord Adams. He heals with the power of laughter."
3,12,0,PATCH CORD ADAMS,"C'mon, take it. What's the matter, can't move your arms?"
3,12,0,BENDER,"Obviously not, or I'd be strangling you right now."
3,12,0,PATCH CORD ADAMS,"Hey, here's a giggle! Did you hear why they're using Windows 3000 as a prison guard?"
3,12,0,FRY,"No, why?"
3,12,0,PATCH CORD ADAMS,'Cause it always locks up.
3,12,0,BENDER,"For the love of God, somebody kick his ass!"
3,12,0,PATCH CORD ADAMS,"Well, so long. Get well soon. Oh, well, so long anyway."
3,12,0,BENDER,"Oh, I'm doomed. Everybody leave me alone. I don't wanna be seen this way."
3,12,0,FRY,"Aw, you look so sad. You want me to send Patch Cord Adams back in?"
3,12,0,BENDER,"Hey, the blues. The tragic sound of other people suffering. That's kind of a pick-me-up. Wow, that was great."
3,12,0,BECK,"Hey, thanks. You a fan?"
3,12,0,BENDER,"I dunno. Let me see. Oh my God, you're Beck! I'd get up to shake your hand and steal your wallet but my crappy body crapped out on me."
3,12,0,BECK,Don't take it so hard. I used to miss my body too but then I fished this manequin out of the 92c Store dumpster.
3,12,0,BENDER,"Wow. We've sure got a lot in common, Beck. I always dreamed of being a musician-poet who transcends genres even as he re-invents them, just like you."
3,12,0,BECK,"So do it, robot. It's easier than it looks."
3,12,0,BENDER,"Eh, thanks, but it's hopeless. I'll never be a musician now."
3,12,0,BECK,Or maybe you'll be the best musician ever.
3,12,0,BENDER,What's this for?
3,12,0,BECK,"Try and scrape it across your chest like a knife on burnt toast. Come on, move those arms. Use the power of mental thinking. Make it dynamic. Yeah-ee! Alright, congratulations my friend."
3,12,0,BENDER,Why? 'Cause I can make annoying noises?
3,12,0,BECK,"Exactly. I use those all the time in my music. Bender, I want you to become my new washboard player."
3,12,0,BENDER,Alright! Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
3,12,0,BENDER,"Well, that's my good friend, Beck. I'm of to rock a series of mid-level venues."
3,12,0,HERMES,"Kudos, Bender. You got mangled and now you're a singer. Both our dreams came true."
3,12,0,FRY,"Hey, I have an idea. Who wants to cram in my van and follow Bender on tour and live there, in the van?"
3,12,0,ZOIDBERG,"Oh, I don't know, Fry. I think I'm too poor to follow a band around in a van."
3,12,0,BECK,"Come on, move it! We gotta get to the concert and make the audience wait for it at the start."
3,12,0,ZOIDBERG,"Bad news, friends. My shell ran."
3,12,0,AMY,"Zoidberg, you idiot, my outfit. It's, it's -"
3,12,0,LEELA,Kinda cool.
3,12,0,FRY,"Yeah, I like it."
3,12,0,AMY,"Me too, now that I'm used to it."
3,12,0,ZOIDBERG,"Then it was all on purpose. You're lucky to have Zoidberg as a friend. But cross me, and I'll turn on you like that."
3,12,0,BECK,There's a destination a little up the road
3,12,0,,Pullin' out jives and jamboree handouts Two turntables and a microphone Bottles and cans just clap your hands just clap your hands.
3,12,0,ALL,Where it's at!
3,12,0,BENDER,Got a washboard stomach and a microphone.
3,12,0,BECK,That was a washboard break.
3,12,0,FRY,Oh yeah!
3,12,0,AMY,"Yeah! One bowl of Jell-O knuckles, please."
3,12,0,BARMAN,That'll be three pick-e-tures of George Washington.
3,12,0,AMY,"Oh no, my beautiful money."
3,12,0,LEELA,It got ruined in the wash.
3,12,0,FRY,"Mine too, even my change."
3,12,0,BARMAN,Get lost you money-less hippies!
3,12,0,BECK,"Bender, that was the best 40-minute washboard solo I've ever heard. And the parts when I was awake blew my mind."
3,12,0,BENDER,"Whoa, check out all those broken robots. Howdy, fellas!"
3,12,0,ROBOT #1,"I don't believe my broken eyes, it's Bender, the washboard player! Hey man, we caught your concert from here."
3,12,0,ROBOT #2,You rock!
3,12,0,FEMBOT,"Oh, oh, Bender! Sign my chest!"
3,12,0,ROBOT #3,"Yo, brother, thanks for showing us broken robots are still useful."
3,12,0,BENDER,"Aw, hang in there, folks. I'll bet before you know it, you guys'll be - That is so wrong. They can't just melt down broken robots. Not right when they're kissing my ass."
3,12,0,BECK,"Whoa, dog. Just cold chill. You know, when I'm upset, I write a song about it. Like when I wrote Devil's Haircut, I was feeling really...what's that song about?"
3,12,0,BENDER,"Hey, yeah, I could write a song! With real words, not phony ones like ""odelay""."
3,12,0,BECK,"""Odelay"" is a word. Just look it up in the Becktionary."
3,12,0,BENDER,Ooh!
3,12,0,BENDER,"I'm working on my song. Hand me the Becktionary. No, no, the rhyming Becktionary."
3,12,0,BECK,I wish I could help raise awareness about broken robots. But what can I do? I only weigh eight pounds.
3,12,0,BENDER,"Wait a minute, you know lots of rock stars, and most of them like to look as though they care about things!"
3,12,0,BECK,We can all get together for a big benefit concert in San Francisco!
3,12,0,BENDER,"And we could call it ""Bend-Aid"", after me, Bender!"
3,12,0,BECK,And you can sing that song you're writing!
3,12,0,BENDER,And I'll let you sing backup! But remember who the star is. Me: Bender.
3,12,0,BENDER,"Alright. ""Hands in the air"" rhymes with ""Just don't care"" and...finished! Eck! Smells like something died in the wall!"
3,12,0,FRY,Surprise!
3,12,0,LEELA,Mind if we crash here tonight? The colours in the van are keeping us awake.
3,12,0,BENDER,"Alright, but hands off the minibar."
3,12,0,FRY,"Wow, I forgot about TV. Living free on the road, you realise how much better life is without it. Well, let's see what's on."
3,12,0,ANNOUNCER #1,"Tuesday, Golden Gate Park, the monsters of vaguely folkish alterna-rock will strum your brains out at Bend-Aid! Featuring Beck, Wailing Fungus and special guest, Bender!"
3,12,0,ANNOUNCER #2,A portion of the proceeds might go to help broken robots.
3,12,0,FRY,Yeah!
3,12,0,ZOIDBERG,"Hooray, robot!"
3,12,0,AMY,"Bender, you're famous!"
3,12,0,BENDER,Yeah.
3,12,0,LEELA,"This coming together of superstars really means a lot to you, doesn't it, Bender?"
3,12,0,BENDER,"Uh-huh. Helping my defective brothers is the first thing I've ever cared about, even the slightest bit. You know, when I first got broken, I thought my life was over. But look at me now. I've got fame, money, groupies, and it's all thanks to being completely immobolised. That's why I'll be proud to go up on stage, tomorrow, and say, ""Look at me, world, I am a broken robot!""."
3,12,0,FRY,"Bender, you can move! You're cured!"
3,12,0,BENDER,"Oh crap, it's a miracle."
3,12,0,BENDER,I can move again. My music career is over.
3,12,0,FRY,"Bender, I don't claim to understand ""the biz"" but wouldn't being able to move help your music career?"
3,12,0,BENDER,"No, don't you see? I was a hero to broken robots 'cause I was one of them. But how can I sing about being damaged if I'm not? That's like Christina Aguilera singing in Spanish. Wait, that's it. I'll fake it!"
3,12,1,AMY,You'd better not do that at the concert.
3,12,1,ZOIDBERG,"I can't stop. When I eat too much dirt, I get stuff in my throat."
3,12,1,AMY,"You are so disgusting, I -"
3,12,1,LEELA,They're beautiful.
3,12,1,ZOIDBERG,"Eww, you're touching them."
3,12,1,AMY,"I've never seen pearls like this. Dr. Zoidberg, you're amazing."
3,12,1,ZOIDBERG,I am? At last! Recognition!
3,12,1,EMCEE,"Gentle-hippies, put your filthy hands together for the folk stylings of Cylon and Garfunkel!"
3,12,1,GARFUNKEL,"Here's a song that was beautiful when it was performed by my ancestor, Art."
3,12,1,CYLON AND GARFUNKEL,"Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme."
3,12,1,GARFUNKEL,"Remember me to one who loves there,"
3,12,1,CYLON AND GARFUNKEL,She once was a true love of mine.
3,12,1,LEELA,We're home.
3,12,1,AMY,"Well, let's earn some bread."
3,12,1,FRY,"Brothers and sisters, get your love beads. Can't journey to the centre of your mind without love beads!"
3,12,1,HIPPIE #1,"Wow, look at these colours. These'll go great with my soul."
3,12,1,ZOIDBERG,"Glad you like them. I've been making fine jewellery for years, apparently."
3,12,1,HIPPIE #2,I'll take three.
3,12,1,HIPPIE #3,"Give me one, man!"
3,12,1,HIPPIE #4,I'll trade you a bad poem!
3,12,1,EMCEE,"And now, stand up and turn on your hidden tape recorders for...Beck! With special guest, Bender the broken robot."
3,12,1,FRY,Bender rules!
3,12,1,HIPPIE #5,"Groove on, man!"
3,12,1,LEELA,"Rock it, Bender!"
3,12,1,ZOIDBERG,Play that thing!
3,12,1,BECK,Can't you hear those cavalry drums
3,12,1,BENDER,"Whoa-oh, yeah!"
3,12,1,BECK,...Midnight hags in the mausoleum...
3,12,1,BECK,"Thank you. That song doesn't usually last three hours, but we got into a serious thing...and then I forgot how it ended. Anyway, one last item of business before we go."
3,12,1,GARFUNKEL,"Bender, to start your foundation for broken robots, here's a big cardboard cheque for $14,000."
3,12,1,CYLON,It's been an emotional day for me.
3,12,1,BENDER,I don't know what to say.
3,12,1,BECK,Then maybe you should sing it. Lay it down boys.
3,12,1,BENDER,"Ladies, gentlemen, smoking heaps of machinery......this is a song called My Broken Friend."
3,12,1,BECK,Kick it!
3,12,1,BENDER,He could make a good...
3,12,1,BENDER AND BECK,...hatrack
3,12,1,BECK,He only has to stand there
3,12,1,BENDER,Or a cheap...
3,12,1,BENDER AND BECK,...doorstop
3,12,1,BECK,He doesn't need to move
3,12,1,BENDER,Or a great big...
3,12,1,BENDER AND BECK,...giant Thermos
3,12,1,BENDER,With a twist-off top
3,12,1,BECK,That would be good for soup
3,12,1,BENDER,He could be a storage closet...
3,12,1,BENDER AND BECK,...For outdated pants
3,12,1,BECK,I like 'em tight!
3,12,1,BENDER,My broken friend could do it all...
3,12,1,BENDER AND BECK,...Just give him a chance!
3,12,1,BENDER,That robot has a tragic secret
3,12,1,,That I'd like to share...
3,12,1,BECK,For real?
3,12,1,BENDER,...My broken friend is closer to me
3,12,1,BECK,Hm.
3,12,1,BENDER,...That robot's name I never told you...
3,12,1,BECK,Who's that?
3,12,1,BENDER,...You could not foresee...
3,12,1,BECK,"C'mon, give it up."
3,12,1,BENDER,...I'll say it loud and sing it proud...
3,12,1,BENDER AND BECK,His name is you and me.
3,12,1,BENDER,Don't melt me down into a crowbar
3,12,1,BECK,It suffers alone
3,12,1,BENDER,Just 'cause I can't move my arms and legs
3,12,1,BECK,Hey.
3,12,1,BENDER,Or toss me into a trash can...
3,12,1,BECK,"Bender, what are you doing?"
3,12,1,BENDER,...Just 'cause I can't cook you ham and eggs...
3,12,1,BECK,What are you doing?
3,12,1,BENDER,...Don't crush me into an anchor...
3,12,1,BECK,What's the dealy-o?
3,12,1,BENDER,...Just 'cause I can't jump and dance and sing...
3,12,1,BECK,Hold it! What? No!
3,12,1,BENDER,"...I'm telling you, my broken friend..."
3,12,1,BECK,B-Bender.
3,12,1,BENDER,...Put your hands in the air like you just don't care!
3,12,1,BECK,No!
3,12,1,BENDER,"I'm telling you, my broken friend..."
3,12,1,BECK,Cut it!
3,12,1,BENDER,...Can do 'most anything!
3,12,1,BECK,Cut it!
3,12,1,BENDER,Yeah!
3,12,1,BECK,Cut it!
3,12,1,BENDER,Curse my natural showmanship!
3,12,1,ROBOT #1,You big fat fraud! You're not really broken!
3,12,1,ROBOT #2,But you will be in a minute! Bum-rush the stage!
3,12,1,ROBOT #3,Get him!
3,12,3,HIPPIE #6,"Oh harsh, I didn't get my beads."
3,12,3,BECK,"You, minion, lift up my arm. After him!"
3,12,4,BENDER,"Well everyone, prepare to get your guts kicked out by folk singers."
3,12,6,CATERPILLAR ALIEN,What is this? The Year of the Jerk?
3,12,7,FRY,"Hurry, the Golden Gate Bridge. Put the metal to the pedal to the other metal."
3,12,7,BENDER,"Oh no, I forgot this is a hoverbridge."
3,12,7,LEELA,And I forgot this isn't a hovercar.
3,12,7,FRY,Is any of that a problem?
3,12,7,ZOIDBERG,Not if you've lived a life without regret.
3,12,7,BENDER,I'll save me!
3,12,7,LEELA,"Quick, grab his footcups."
3,12,7,BENDER,Hey? What? No.
3,12,7,FRY,Phew!
3,12,7,LEELA,Bummer.
3,12,7,BENDER,"Someone fat get in my way! Ah, I'm broken again. I can't move any part of me."
3,12,7,BECK,Good.
3,12,7,BENDER,"I'm really sorry I lied, Beck. All I ever wanted was to make music with you. I never meant to hurt anyone, or help anyone."
3,12,7,BECK,"Bender, that's some played-out, new-jack, horsecrap. But I know you don't mean it so, apology accepted."
3,12,7,BENDER,"So, I can, uh, keep the cheque?"
3,12,7,GARFUNKEL,Over my dead career!
3,12,7,BENDER,"Well, it was worth a shot."
3,12,7,FRY,"C'mon, Bender. If you're done scamming Beck, we're heading home."
3,12,7,BENDER,"Alright, alright. Let me just do one thing to cheer myself up."
