3,14,0,"""I DATED A ROBOT""","By Eric Kaplan Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
3,14,0,SMITH [ON TV],A casino where I'm winning? That car must've killed me. I must be in heaven! A casino where I always win? That's boring. I must really be...in hell!
3,14,0,MAN [ON TV],No Mr Smith. You're not in heaven or hell. You're on an aeroplane.
3,14,0,SMITH [ON TV],There's a gremlin destroying the plane! You've gotta believe me!
3,14,0,MAN [ON TV],Why should I believe you? You're Hitler!
3,14,0,SMITH [ON TV],No! Eva Braun! Help me!
3,14,0,BENDER,Saw it comin'!
3,14,0,FRY,"I just saw something incredibly cool. A big floating ball that lit up with every colour of the rainbow, plus some new ones that were so beautiful I fell to my knees and cried."
3,14,0,AMY,Was it out in front of Discount Shoe Outlet?
3,14,0,FRY,Yeah.
3,14,0,AMY,They have a college kid wear that to attract customers.
3,14,0,FRY,Well I don't care if it was some dork in a costume. For one brief moment I felt the heartbeat of creation. And it was one with my own.
3,14,0,AMY,Big deal.
3,14,0,BENDER,We all feel like that all the time. You don't hear us gassin' on about it.
3,14,0,FRY,"How can you people be so blase? Here you are in the year 3000 or so, yet you just sit around like its the boring time I came from."
3,14,0,FARNSWORTH,Boring? Wasn't that the period where they cracked the human genome and boy bands roamed the Earth?
3,14,0,FRY,Yeah. But now its the distant future. Why aren't we out doing everything I ever dreamed of?
3,14,0,LEELA,"Hey, you know what might be fun?"
3,14,0,FARNSWORTH,No. Why would I know that?
3,14,0,LEELA,Let's take the rest of the morning off and take Fry to do everything he ever wanted to do.
3,14,0,FRY,Everything?
3,14,0,LEELA,Except that.
3,14,1,SAL,Sos your fantasy's always been to destroys a planet huh?
3,14,1,FRY,"Yeah, what did they ever do for me?"
3,14,1,LEELA,"Wow, the most humdrum activities look almost exciting through your eyes. What should we do next?"
3,14,1,FRY,I wanna see the edge of the universe!
3,14,1,AMY,Ooo! That sounds cool.
3,14,1,ZOIDBERG,"It's funny. You live in the universe, but you never do these things til somebody comes to visit."
3,14,1,FRY,"Far out! So, there's an infinite number of parallel universes?"
3,14,1,FARNSWORTH,"No, just the two."
3,14,1,FRY,"Oh, well, I'm sure that's enough."
3,14,1,BENDER,I'm sick of parallel Bender lording his cowboy head over me! Let's move on to Fry's next fantasy.
3,14,1,FRY,"Yeehah! Bow before your master, puny mortals! Whoo! Giddy-up! Ha ha! Woohoo! Whoopie!"
3,14,1,GIRL,"Mommy, why is that man like that?"
3,14,1,MOTHER,Don't look at him!
3,14,1,FRY,That was fun. Let's give him a treat!
3,14,1,LEELA,Keep your palms flat.
3,14,1,FRY,The tongue tickles.
3,14,1,FRY,These new hands are great. I'm gonna break them in tonight.
3,14,1,FARNSWORTH,Yes it's been quite an hour and a half.
3,14,1,FRY,I've only got two fantasies left: Be invisible in a chocolate factory and be romantically linked with a celebrity.
3,14,1,BENDER,I could pound your head 'til you thinks that's what happened.
3,14,1,OK.,
3,14,1,LEELA,"Wait, hold on. It is actually possible to meet any celebrity you want."
3,14,1,FRY,It is?
3,14,1,LEELA,Of course! You should read a blimp sometime.
3,14,1,FRY,Download a celebrity from the internet? What part of that do I understand?
3,14,1,LEELA,It's simple. You can download a celebrity's personality and appearance into a blank robot.
3,14,1,FRY,"Hey, I have an idea. Let's do that!"
3,14,1,FARNSWORTH,Onto the internet you go!
3,14,1,BENDER,Oh and while you're there pick me up a few credit card numbers.
3,14,2,TREKKIE #1,No way! Kirk could kick Picard's ass!
3,14,2,TREKKIE #2,"Eh, at least Picard had the guts to admit he was bald!"
3,14,2,TREKKIE #1,You take that back!
3,14,2,FRY,Ooo! eBay!
3,14,3,AUCTIONEER,Are there no further bids for this exquisite galaxy? Sold to the Being Of Inconceivable Horror.
3,14,3,AUCTIONEER,Yes.
3,14,4,FRY,So where's the celebrity dating place?
3,14,4,LEELA,Let's search the web. Over there.
3,14,5,SALESMAN,Welcome to Nappster. Let's see what celebrities we've got in stock. Can I interest you in Gwyneth Paltrow?
3,14,5,FRY,Nah. I read in Newsweek that she drinks human blood.
3,14,5,SALESMAN,"Then uh, how about Cleopatra? Who's beauty destroyed mighty empires."
3,14,5,FRY,I'd prefer someone from the era of shaved underarms. Do you have anything with a more Lucy Liu feel to it?
3,14,5,SALESMAN,"Nah, nothing like that. Though we do have Lucy Liu. Only woman ever to be named People magazine's woman of the year twice. In 2003, and then again in 2063."
3,14,5,FRY,I'd like the 2003 model.
3,14,6,FRY,Wahoo! I've found her! What do I do now?
3,14,6,FARNSWORTH,Download her. Let's just put a blank robot in the drive.
3,14,6,FRY,It worked!
3,14,6,LIUBOT,You're one sexy man Philip J. Fry!
3,14,6,FRY,It worked perfectly!
3,14,6,LEELA,"Well, you downloaded Lucy Liu. Are you just going to stare vacantly at her and not say anything?"
3,14,6,LIUBOT,I find your slack-jawed stare very attractive Philip J. Fry.
3,14,6,FRY,Did you hear that? She likes me!
3,14,6,FARNSWORTH,Well duh! She's programmed to like you!
3,14,6,FRY,But this is Lucy Liu! Perhaps the only good actress of the 21st century! She's more than just a piece of software.
3,14,6,LIUBOT,Would you like to take a moment to register me?
3,14,6,FRY,"Uh, not right now."
3,14,6,LIUBOT,I'll remind you later you hot stud you!
3,14,6,FRY,"So uh, what do you feel like doing?"
3,14,6,LIUBOT,Would you like to take a moment to register me?
3,14,6,FRY,I said later!
3,14,6,FRY,"Then when I feel so stuffed I can't eat anymore, I just use the restroom, and then I can eat more."
3,14,6,LIUBOT,You should write a book Fry. People need to know about the can eat more.
3,14,6,FRY,Oh Lucy! You're just like I always thought you'd be from your movies.
3,14,6,LIUBOT,"My personality is mathematically derived from my movies, proportionally weighted by box office receipts."
3,14,6,FRY,You're cute!
3,14,6,LIUBOT,You're cute!
3,14,6,FRY,You!
3,14,6,LIUBOT,You!
3,14,6,FRY,You!
3,14,6,LIUBOT,You!
3,14,6,FRY,You!
3,14,6,FARNSWORTH,"Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop and he's an idiot. Well, that's love for you."
3,14,6,BENDER,Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single?? It's 'cause all the fun robot sisters are dating humans!
3,14,6,LEELA,"Bender, this is Fry's decision. And he made it wrong, so it's time for us to interfere in his life."
3,14,6,LEELA,She doesn't really love you. She can't. She's just a machine that -
3,14,6,FRY,"Well, so what if I love a robot? It's not hurting anybody."
3,14,6,HERMES,My God! He never took middle school hygiene. He never saw the propaganda film.
3,14,6,FARNSWORTH,It's just lucky I keep a copy in the VCR at all times!
3,14,6,NARRATOR [IN MOVIE],"Ordinary human dating. It's enjoyable and it serves an important purpose. But when a human dates an artificial mate, there is no purpose. Only enjoyment. And that leads to...tragedy."
3,14,6,BILLY [IN MOVIE],Neato! A Marylin Monroebot!
3,14,6,MONROEBOT [IN MOVIE],Ooo! You're a real dreamboat Billy Everyteen!
3,14,6,NARRATOR [IN MOVIE],Harmless fun? Let's see what happens next!
3,14,6,BILLY [IN MOVIE],"No thank Mom, I'd rather make out with my Monroebot."
3,14,6,BILLY [IN MOVIE],"No thanks dad, I'd rather make out with my Monroebot."
3,14,6,MAVIS [IN MOVIE],"Billy, do you want to come over tonight? We can make out together."
3,14,6,BILLY [IN MOVIE],"Gee Mavis, your house is across the street, that's an awfully long way to go for making out."
3,14,6,NARRATOR [IN MOVIE],"Did you notice what went wrong in that scene? Ordinarily Billy would work hard to make money from his paper route then he'd use the money to buy dinner for Mavis, thus earning the slim chance of performing the reproductive act. But in a world where teens can date robots why should he bother? Why should anyone bother? Let's take a look at Billy's planet a year later. Where are all the football stars? And where are the biochemists? They are trapped - trapped in a soft, vice-like grip of robot lips. All civilisation was just an effort to impress the opposite sex. And sometimes the same sex. Now, let's skip forward 80 years into the future. Where is Billy?"
3,14,6,BILLY [IN MOVIE],Farewell!
3,14,6,NARRATOR [IN MOVIE],The next day Billy's planet was destroyed by aliens. Have you guessed the name of Billy's planet? It was Earth. Don't Date Robots!
3,14,6,LEELA,Did that make any impression on you Fry? Fry?
3,14,6,LIUBOT,Ooo!
3,14,6,FARNSWORTH,I knew I should have shown him Electro Gonhorrhea: The Noisy Killer.
3,14,6,BENDER,"What is the world coming to? That Fry's a sicko pervert I tell you, dating a robot. It's an atrosmacy."
3,14,6,LEELA,But Fry's our friend Bender.
3,14,6,BENDER,Aww jeez would you stifle there meatbag?
3,14,6,LEELA,You stifle Bender.
3,14,6,ZOIDBERG,Hooray! Finally you're standing up to him.
3,14,6,LEELA,Although he is completely right.
3,14,6,BENDER,We've got to stem this tidal wave of moral decay. It's time to shut down nappster.com!
3,14,6,BENDER,Who's in charge of this dump?
3,14,6,JERVIS,That'd be me. If you're an investor you can dump your money in the hole there.
3,14,6,BENDER,Listen you fat internet nerd.
3,14,6,JERVIS,Listening.
3,14,6,BENDER,Your company promotes wrong love! If you don't shut down right now the only thing wired about you will be your jaw!
3,14,6,JERVIS,You can't shut us down. The internet is about the free exchange and sale of other people's ideas. We've done nothing wrong!
3,14,6,LIU [FROM ROOM],Help! I'm being held prisoner!
3,14,6,ZOIDBERG,Someone in trouble is!
3,14,6,JERVIS,No stay out! There's a guy going for the Tetris world record in there!
3,14,7,WOMAN,Who are you?
3,14,7,CHEECH,Don't hurt us!
3,14,7,LIU,Help me! They've been holding me prisoner for 800 years!
3,14,7,ZOIDBERG,The real Lucy Liu! The one you can see a movie of in the popcorn stadium!
3,14,7,BENDER,So what's your problem?
3,14,7,LIU,Those sweaty nerds are making illegal copies of us. It hurts!
3,14,7,BENDER,Its a bluff.
3,14,7,LEELA,We can't take that chance. Move people move!
3,14,7,GEORGE MICHAEL,Please pick me up before you go go!
3,14,7,LEELA,She asked first.
3,14,8,NERD,"Uh, are you Lucy Liu?"
3,14,8,ALBRIGHTBOT,Sure!
3,14,9,JERVIS,"Oh we're doomed. They got the head, they uncovered the sign! Soon the whole world will learn we're cyber criminals! And we would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling adults."
3,14,9,MAN,"We'll stop them. They like Lucy Liu, we'll give them all the Lucy Liu they can handle! Hand me that backup disk."
3,14,10,ZOIDBERG,Did you see me escaping? I was like
3,14,10,LIU,"Thanks for rescuing me, especially you Bender. Mmm, quite a masculine piece of metal aren't you?"
3,14,10,BENDER,Hey don't look at me like that. If you're thinking of crossing the line with Bender you can forget it. Bender don't bend that way.
3,14,10,LEELA,Hey look its another Lucy Liubot.
3,14,10,LIUBOT #2,I am Lucy Liu. Give me your spines.
3,14,10,ZOIDBERG,Hey what the?
3,14,10,LIUBOT #2,Take this and that and one of these.
3,14,10,LIU,Hey cut it out! I don't need this kind of publicity!
3,14,10,LEELA,Alright Liu. Time to kick your frosty well toned ass! Heyya!
3,14,10,BENDER,Then along came Bender!
3,14,10,ZOIDBERG,Looks like you're retaining water.
3,14,10,LIU,That was incredible Bender. You're like Jackie Chan before he got all doughy.
3,14,10,BENDER,Aw shucks. I wasn't afraid of that robot. I'm pretty brave when you get past my macho exterior! It's an army of Lucy Lius!
3,14,10,LIU,They're horrible!
3,14,10,LIUBOT #3,Robot Croucing Tiger.
3,14,10,LIUBOT #4,Robot Crane style!
3,14,11,ZAPP,Now that's a wave of destruction that's easy on the eyes.
3,14,11,FRY,This is the best movie I've ever seen. It has a vampire and an explosion!
3,14,11,LIUBOT,It's amazing the way you notice two things.
3,14,11,ALEX [IN MOVIE],No! Don't open that coffin! It's ticking!
3,14,11,NATALIE [IN MOVIE],I have to Alex. That coffin's not going to open itself!
3,14,11,VAMPIRE [IN MOVIE],Bleurgh!
3,14,11,LIU,Let's hide in here. It'll add to my box office gross!
3,14,11,LEELA,Fry?
3,14,11,FRY,"Aww, you guys came to watch me make out! That is so sweet. Wait a minute! Is that the head of who I think it's of?"
3,14,11,LIU,Read the jar Evelyn Wood! Dr Z?
3,14,11,LEELA,"Fry, a herd of Lucy Liu are destroying the city. Is yours acting normally?"
3,14,11,FRY,Let me see. Yep. Why do you ask?
3,14,11,ALEX [IN MOVIE],"Mr Mayor, if you want to see a real vampire look in the mirror!"
3,14,11,MAYOR [IN MOVIE],I can't! I'm a vampire!
3,14,11,ZOIDBERG,Why?
3,14,11,LEELA,And Nappster says illegal copies never hurt anybody.
3,14,11,FRY (SHOUTING),"Quick, this way!"
3,14,12,FRY,"Sorry laides, employees only."
3,14,13,LEELA,Oh no. They're forming a human pyramid...of robots.
3,14,13,BENDER,Dammit! We weren't counting on them being as smart as they are sexy!
3,14,13,LIU,A dangerous mistake to make.
3,14,13,ZOIDBERG,At least we've got food.
3,14,13,LEELA,Dr Zoidberg cut open that bag!
3,14,13,ZOIDBERG,Hooray!
3,14,13,LEELA,And don't eat it.
3,14,13,ZOIDBERG,Life was bad but now its good forever!
3,14,13,BENDER,You'll be safe in here sweetheart. Get lost Pavorotti!
3,14,13,FRY,"Lucy Liubot, if I don't survive the corn I want you to know that I love you as much as a man can love a computerised image of gorgeous celebrity. Which it turns out is a lot."
3,14,13,LIUBOT,"Oh Fry, I love you more than the moon and the stars and the poetic image number 37 not found."
3,14,13,FRY,What are you doing darling? Get down!
3,14,13,FRY,You saved us. Are you alright?
3,14,13,LIUBOT,Yes my love. I'll be just massive corn clog in port seven.
3,14,13,LIU,Are you the last copy of me?
3,14,13,LIUBOT,Yes.
3,14,13,LIU,Erase her Fry.
3,14,13,FRY,What?? No!
3,14,13,LIU,"Fry, when you downloaded her without my permission you stole my image. And in the end that's all I really have. That and the largest gold nugget in the world - one mile in diameter."
3,14,13,FRY,But I just downloaded her because I love you.
3,14,13,LIU,"If you love the real Lucy Liu and not what you've seen in movies, genre stradling lawyer shows and kiss ass articles in People magazine, you'll blank out that robot."
3,14,13,FRY,I'm sorry. Hug me Liubot.
3,14,13,LIUBOT,I'll always remember you Fry memory deleted.
3,14,13,BENDER,I know it hurts buddy. But at least you're not in a sick relationship with a robot anymore.
3,14,13,FRY,Uh huh. And I guess now maybe I can get to know the real Lucy Liu.
3,14,13,BENDER,Pft! Yeah at our wedding!
3,14,13,LIU,It's true. Bender and I are in love.
3,14,13,FRY,"But, but!"
3,14,13,BENDER,Don't be a prude Fry!
