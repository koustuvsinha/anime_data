3,3,0,"""PARASITES LOST""","By Eric Kaplan Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
3,3,1,MAN #1 [ON RADIO],"Breaker breaker, this is the Duck. Uh, you wanna back off them hogs?"
3,3,1,MAN #1 [ON RADIO],"Ten-four, five miles or so."
3,3,1,MAN #2 [ON RADIO],"Ten, roger!"
3,3,1,LEELA,"Hmm, I'd better check the fluid levels. We're OK on Coke syrup."
3,3,1,BENDER,"Oh man, come on! Comin' through!"
3,3,3,BENDER,What's that black cracker?
3,3,3,FRY,A tomato.
3,3,3,LEELA,You're not gonna eat a sandwich from a truck stop men's room are you?
3,3,3,FRY,"Eh, what's the worst thing that could happen? Ugh, it's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's throwing up!"
3,3,3,TRUCKER #1,Looky there! It's one of them things like on our mudflaps!
3,3,3,TRUCKER #2,Yosemite Sam?
3,3,3,SAL,Stands back! I'm gonna puts my moves on her. Whoas!
3,3,3,FRY,That jerk! No one hoots at my captain unless they're prepared to take it to the next level!
3,3,3,LEELA,Fry please. That's sweet but I'd rather not even dignify them with an ass whooping!
3,3,3,SAL,Hey sexy mama! Let's get busy and freaky in that order!
3,3,3,FRY,Hey jumbo! How would you like it if Leela said you were sexy and she wanted to make love with you?
3,3,3,SAL,"Eh, I gots five minutes. She looks pretty good for a truck stop chick!"
3,3,3,FRY,You take that back! She does not look good for a truck stop chick!
3,3,3,SAL,Yeah you're right. She don't gots enough meat for a guy like me.
3,3,3,FRY,She does too! She's loaded with meat! She's got more meat than a cow! Ow!
3,3,3,SAL (LAUGHING),More meat than a cow!
3,3,3,FRY,I can't please Leela no matter what I do! I just want her to like me.
3,3,3,BENDER,Well there's always hope. C'mon we gotta go fix the plasma fusion boiler.
3,3,3,BENDER,Who are you?
3,3,3,SCRUFFY,Scruffy. The janitor.
3,3,3,BENDER,Well why aren't you fixing the boiler?
3,3,3,SCRUFFY,Schedule conflict.
3,3,3,BENDER,There. Fixed forever.
3,3,3,SCRUFFY,Scruffy's gonna die the way he lived. Oh marmalade!
3,3,3,ZOIDBERG,Oh the hypochondriac's back. So what is it this time?
3,3,3,FRY,Well my lead pipe hurts a little?
3,3,3,ZOIDBERG,That's normal. Next patient.
3,3,3,BENDER,He's a witch!
3,3,3,FARNSWORTH,"Fry, did you eat anything unusual recently?"
3,3,3,FRY,No.
3,3,3,LEELA,What about that bathroom egg salad from the truck stop?
3,3,3,FRY,I've had better.
3,3,3,FARNSWORTH,"Egg salad? Hmm. Zoidberg will have to examine your gastrointestinal tract. Come everyone, give Fry some privacy."
3,3,4,FARNSWORTH,"If you can't see well enough through the two-way mirror, there'll be a close-up on this video screen."
3,3,5,ZOIDBERG,Hmm. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Guess again.
3,3,6,AMY,Gross!
3,3,6,FARNSWORTH,Watch for any subtle irregularity in Fry's bowel.
3,3,6,AMY,It's gorgeous. That place used to be a big dump.
3,3,6,BENDER,"Oh, eww!"
3,3,6,AMY,Worms? Eww! Puke-a-tronic!
3,3,6,LEELA,So the eggs in that egg salad sandwich were -
3,3,6,FARNSWORTH,Correct! Worm eggs! And the mayonaise was probably none too fresh either.
3,3,6,HERMES,It's nauseating man! Is there no way to get rid of the disgusting maggots?
3,3,6,FARNSWORTH,"Only one. We'll have to travel deep inside Fry, in this!"
3,3,6,BENDER,Shotgun!
3,3,6,FARNSWORTH,"In each gastro-survival kit, you'll find a rain slicker, a disposable fun camera, and something to protect you against bacteria.... - a harpoon!"
3,3,6,BENDER,"Yo, old guy. Why do we have to use those tiny micro-droids? Can't you just shrink us?"
3,3,6,FARNSWORTH,Oh my no. That would require extrememly tiny atoms. And have you priced those lately? I'm not made of money - leave me alone!
3,3,6,ZOIDBERG,Me next!
3,3,6,FARNSWORTH,"Anyhoo, your net suits will let you experience Fry's worm-infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them."
3,3,6,ZOIDBERG,There's no part of that sentence I didn't like.
3,3,6,FARNSWORTH,Is everyone present?
3,3,6,AMY,Right on!
3,3,6,BENDER,Uh-huh.
3,3,6,HERMES,Definately.
3,3,6,ZOIDBERG,Yes.
3,3,6,FARNSWORTH,"Heres the plan: We'll enter the ear, drip down the back of the throat and make for the bowel. There, we'll irritate the pelvic splachnic ganglion and cause an intestinal spasm, expelling - among other things - the parasites."
3,3,6,BENDER,I'll tell Fry to wash out - among other things - his ear.
3,3,6,FARNSWORTH,"No, Fry can't know anything about the mission. If he finds out, the worms will try to defend themselves. They know everything he knows."
3,3,6,BENDER,They know how to make ice cream soup?
3,3,6,FARNSWORTH,"Leela, your role is to distract Fry so he doesn't notice what we're up to."
3,3,6,LEELA (ECHOING),Can do!
3,3,6,AMY,"Leela, you should really try a facial scrubs, for your pores."
3,3,6,LEELA,Look! A starling!
3,3,6,FRY [LOOKING AWAY],Really?
3,3,8,AMY (WHISPERING),
3,3,9,FRY,What about what?
3,3,9,LEELA,"Uh...what if we go for a walk possibly because it's such a lovely day, perhaps."
3,3,9,FRY,I'd love to!
3,3,11,HERMES,We gotta get someplace where he won't stick his finger!
3,3,11,BENDER,It's hopeless! Abandon ship!
3,3,11,FARNSWORTH,"Wait, we just have to get past the eardrum!"
3,3,13,HERMES [FROM SHIP],What are those worms doing to Fry's brain?
3,3,13,HERMES [FROM SHIP],My God! Soon he'll be smarter than Cher!
3,3,13,FRY,"Ah, the scent of a rose. Curious how an aromatic chain of hydrocarbons can evoke our deepest emotions. For you."
3,3,13,LEELA,That's such a beautiful thought Fry. And what's more amazing you expressed it without spewing crumbs at me!
3,3,15,FARNSWORTH,Brace yourselves everyone. We're entering the interior of Fry's nose!
3,3,15,BENDER,We're at finger alert five.
3,3,15,FARNSWORTH,Let's just pray nothing stimulates the delicate smell receptors. Nobody make a smell.
3,3,18,ZOIDBERG,Quick! We can escape through that nasal capillary into the sinus.
3,3,20,HERMES,Strange. Usually you don't know anything about human anatomy.
3,3,20,ZOIDBERG,"I learned it from a decongestant commercial. ""Soothing action, action, action action..."""
3,3,25,BENDER,"Where are we, the ass?"
3,3,25,FARNSWORTH,"We're in the heart. Better known as ""the love muscle."""
3,3,25,ZOIDBERG,Where the food is digested.
3,3,25,FARNSWORTH,"We should be safe, just so long as nothing makes it beat faster."
3,3,28,BENDER,Abandon ship!
3,3,28,FARNSWORTH,No! Set course for that cholesterol-encrusted valve.
3,3,29,ZOIDBERG,It's good cholesterol but it spreads like bad cholesterol!
3,3,29,AMY [FROM SHIP],Look! They're jazzercising Fry's muscles!
3,3,30,HERMES,He'll be as strong and flexible as Gumbo and Hercules combined!
3,3,30,ZOIDBERG,Gumbercules? I love that guy!
3,3,30,LEELA,Ugh! It's that jerk from the truck stop! Let's cross the street and try to blend in with that crowd of pimps.
3,3,30,FRY,"I don't think so. Sir, I believe you owe this lady an apology."
3,3,30,LEELA,Fry no! He's bulging with what could be muscles! Ooo!
3,3,30,SAL,I gots your apologys right heres! Sorrys ma'am. I've learnsed a lesson about not ogling cans that I won't soons forgets.
3,3,31,BENDER,Abandon ship!
3,3,31,FARNSWORTH,"No, don't give up now! we're but a stones throw from the pyloric sphinchter."
3,3,34,BENDER [FROM SHIP],Hooray!
3,3,34,ZOIDBERG [FROM SHIP],Hooray!
3,3,34,HERMES [FROM SHIP],We made it!
3,3,35,FARNSWORTH,There it is! The stately capitol of Fry's bowel. A heavily guarded fortress surrounding the pelvic splachnic ganglion.
3,3,35,ZOIDBERG,"I've heard of that, who said I haven't?!"
3,3,35,FARNSWORTH,"If we can stimulate that nerve, the bowel will convulse, expelling the entire worm society."
3,3,35,HERMES,But what about the worms in the other parts of his body?
3,3,35,FARNSWORTH,"Listen, this is gonna be one hell of a bowel movement. Afterwards he'll be lucky if he has any bones left!"
3,3,35,BENDER,"All right, let's mush some worms!"
3,3,36,WORM MAYOR,Worms to battlestations!
3,3,36,LEELA,"I had a great time today. The flowers, the puddle, the way you hurt that guy. But can I ax you something?"
3,3,36,FRY,Anything.
3,3,36,LEELA,Why did you do all that stuff?
3,3,36,FRY,"Leela, there's something I've wanted to tell you for a long time but every time I try I get nervous and my mouth feels like it's stuffed with peanut butter, even when it's not."
3,3,36,LEELA,What is it? Is it about Bender?
3,3,36,FRY,"No, it's about you and me."
3,3,36,LEELA,And Bender?
3,3,36,FRY,Bender's not involved. Leela...I love you.
3,3,36,LEELA,You do?
3,3,36,FRY,Yes. But it's only recently I've been able to articulate my thoughts. I love you Leela and I always have.
3,3,36,LEELA,"Fry, that's the sweetest, most wonderful - wait! Recently? Like since you ate that toilet sandwich?"
3,3,36,FRY,Yeah! I don't know why but my life really turned around that day!
3,3,36,LEELA,Stay here.
3,3,36,WAITRESS,Freshen your nocatina?
3,3,36,FRY,Please......I need something to settle my stomach.
3,3,37,FARNSWORTH,The nerve is through here. Where's Zoidberg?
3,3,37,ZOIDBERG,Yippie-ki-yay! You'll never guess where I've been!
3,3,38,FARNSWORTH,There it is! The pelvic splachnic ganglion. Tickle it and get ready for the ride of your lives!
3,3,38,LEELA,Don't even think about tickling that ganglion!
3,3,38,FARNSWORTH,"Leela, you're just in time to help. If we don't get rid of the worms now, they'll burrow so deep into the bowel that not even Hermes' famous jerk prunes could dislodge them!"
3,3,38,HERMES,"I call it ""Carribean Drain-o""!"
3,3,38,FARNSWORTH,Fry will be stuck with the worms forever.
3,3,38,LEELA,Perfect.
3,3,38,ZOIDBERG,Ouch!
3,3,39,AMY,I'm OK.
3,3,39,FARNSWORTH,Leela you ignorant dope! Now the worms will be in Fry forever.
3,3,39,LEELA,So? Did you ever stop to think that Fry is better off with worms?
3,3,39,FARNSWORTH,Oh that's stupid!
3,3,39,FRY,"If anyone wants to tell me what's going on here, I'll be in the lounge."
3,3,39,FRY,"Of all the parasites I've had over the years, these worms are among the - hell! They are the best! Leela, how can I ever repay you for saving them?"
3,3,39,LEELA (SEXFULLY),I'll think of something.
3,3,39,BENDER,'Ello! What's all this then?
3,3,39,FRY,Apartment 1I. The old me would have made a joke about that!
3,3,40,LEELA,I'm thinking of having a window installed.
3,3,40,FRY,I think the view's perfect already.
3,3,40,LEELA,"Oh, that's the corniest thing I've ever heard! Let me show you the bedroom."
3,3,40,FRY,Wait. In a minute.
3,3,40,LEELA,A holophonor? Only a few people in the whole universe can play that. And they're not very good at it.
3,3,40,FRY,They don't have you to inspire them.
3,3,40,LEELA,I don't have words to say how wonderful you are Fry. I haven't felt this happy since double-soup Tuesday at the orphanarium.
3,3,40,FRY,"When I'm with you, everyday seems like double-soup Tuesday."
3,3,40,LEELA,"Oh Fry, I love what you've become."
3,3,40,FRY,What I've become.
3,3,40,LEELA,What is it?
3,3,40,FRY,There's just something I have to find out.
3,3,41,FRY,Who controls this bowel?
3,3,41,WORM GUARD #1,Who wants to know?
3,3,41,WORM MAYOR,I am the Lord Mayor of Cologne.
3,3,41,FRY,You mean colon?
3,3,41,WORM MAYOR,State your business!
3,3,41,FRY,"Your excellency, have you ever been in love?"
3,3,41,WORM MAYOR,No. I thought I was once but then I remember our species reproduces with a cloud of spores.
3,3,41,FRY,"Well, a wonderful girl loves me. But I need to know if it's really me she loves, or just what you worms have made of me. That's why with all due respect, I'm asking you to leave."
3,3,41,WORM MAYOR,"Listen you, I was born here. I raised a cloud of children here. My ancestors came over here on the sandwich. No one can make me leave!"
3,3,43,FRY,Everyone out of my body or the brain gets it!
3,3,43,WORM MAYOR,He's bluffing. No creature would willingly make an idiot out of itself.
3,3,43,FRY,"Obviously you've never been in love! Ow! Ow! Ow! Now, the hand-eye co-ordination lobe."
3,3,43,WORM GUARD #1,Stop it man!
3,3,43,WORM MAYOR,"You've damaged your brain Universe, but no more than a week of binge drinking or five minutes on a cell phone."
3,3,43,FRY,"I was just working my way towards the medulla oblongata - control centre of the heart and lungs. And if I kill myself, you die with me."
3,3,43,WORM GUARD #2,Wait a minute man!
3,3,43,FRY,"I hope Satan has a nice colon, 'cause that's where you're gonna be living!"
3,3,43,WORM MAYOR,Stop! We'll leave. But one day you'll be eating a fast-food burger and boom! You'll be crawling with us again! Ever wonder what makes special sauce so special? Yo!
3,3,43,LEELA,Fry? I missed you. Did you find out what you needed to find out?
3,3,43,FRY,"I'm about to. Leela, let me play for you one for time."
3,3,43,LEELA,You don't have to do that. I'm still seduced from before.
3,3,43,FRY,"Please, it's important to me."
3,3,43,LEELA,What's that supposed to mean?
3,3,43,FRY,I don't know. I got nervous and started thinking about neck bolts. Wow! Did you see that vase break? It was all like -
3,3,43,LEELA,What's happened to you?
3,3,43,FRY,Nothing. I got rid of the worms.
3,3,43,LEELA,What? Why would you do that?
3,3,43,FRY,"Leela, I had worms. I needed to know who you loved. Me or them."
3,3,43,LEELA,Well...which of you wrote me that sonnet?
3,3,43,FRY,"I did. I think. It was probably about 50/50. But that's how I really felt about you, I swear!"
3,3,43,LEELA,I don't know.
3,3,43,FRY,"Please. Give me a chance to be romantic on my own. I've got a baggy of massage oil, and I'm gonna give you my super back rub, just like a I used to give Amy when I was going out with her, and she always seemed... - Uh-oh!"
3,3,43,BENDER,"Sorry you struck out sausage link. If it's any consolation, my life is great! Babes! Bucks! I got it all!"
3,3,43,FRY,"Well, at least I learned Leela's a lost cause. I give up."
3,3,43,BENDER,There you go! Goodnight. I gotta get up early to go parasailing with movie stars!
