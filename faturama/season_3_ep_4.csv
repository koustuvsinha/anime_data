3,4,0,"""AMAZON WOMEN IN THE MOOD""","By Lewis Morton Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
3,4,0,HERMES,"People, we got a problem: Little Nibbler's been coughing up hairballs."
3,4,0,LEELA,"Well, so has Fry. What's the big deal?"
3,4,0,FRY,He's got me beat!
3,4,0,HERMES,"Now well all love Nibbler, so it's only fair that we all pitch in and clean it up together. Still, I propose we make Zoidberg do it. All in favour?"
3,4,0,LEELA,Yeah!
3,4,0,BENDER,"Alright, yup."
3,4,0,HERMES,All opposed? All abstaining?
3,4,0,LEELA,Dr. Zoidberg? Are you OK?
3,4,0,FRY,He's dead.
3,4,0,BENDER,What?
3,4,0,AMY,Oh no!
3,4,0,FARNSWORTH,"He always seemed so full of life. Laughing, singing, begging for scraps. And now this."
3,4,0,ZOIDBERG,Why with all the crying? So that's where I left my shell.
3,4,0,LEELA,I didn't know you could take this thing off.
3,4,0,ZOIDBERG,"It was starting to get a little cramped in there so I molted, why not? Ah, the fresh air feels good!"
3,4,0,FARNSWORTH,Stop doing that!
3,4,0,ZOIDBERG,So long. I'm off to toss this old shell in the dumpster and maybe pick up those potato chips Amy didn't finish yesterday.
3,4,0,AMY,Those were toenail clippings.
3,4,0,ZOIDBERG,A feast is a feast.
3,4,0,AMY,"Hey, that's my cellphone!"
3,4,1,AMY,Hello? Hello? Who is this? Hello? Hello?
3,4,1,LEELA,What's wrong? Did you swallow your phone again?
3,4,1,AMY,Some guy's been calling and hanging up 10 times a day for a year.
3,4,1,LEELA,Men who call too much are the worst ... I bet.
3,4,1,AMY,I just wish a decent guy would call me instead of this spleeze-ball who has me too terrified to even answer the phone. Hello?
3,4,1,AMY,Hello? Is anyone there?
3,4,1,KIF,I love you. Why must I be such a coward?
3,4,1,ZAPP,"Kif, I'm headed to the men's room and I'll be needing an attendant so-- Oh, I'm sorry. You're crying like a woman. It's alright. I've always thought myself as a father figure to some of my more pathetic men. Kif, old friend, let's rap."
3,4,1,KIF,"Well, I'm in love with this girl--"
3,4,1,ZAPP,"Oh, that's rich! Go on."
3,4,1,KIF,I met her a year ago...
3,4,1,KIF,...when we were escaping from that cruise ship you piloted directly into a black hole.
3,4,1,ZAPP,Yes! It was in all the papers.
3,4,1,AMY,Call me.
3,4,1,ZAPP,"Uh-huh, uh-huh. Mm-hmm, uh-huh."
3,4,1,KIF,"I've finished talking, sir."
3,4,1,ZAPP,Belay that remark! Your Amy knows my Leela? I have formed an idea!
3,4,1,ZAPP,"I'm calling to negotiate a double date. You and me, Kif and Amy."
3,4,1,LEELA,Forget it.
3,4,2,ZAPP,Then let the negotiations begin. I propose we go out on 10 dates.
3,4,2,LEELA,How about zero?
3,4,2,ZAPP,Nine.
3,4,2,LEELA,Zero.
3,4,3,ZAPP,Seven.
3,4,4,LEELA,Zero.
3,4,4,ZAPP,Eight?
3,4,4,AMY,"Please, Leela? Kif's like the sweetest guy who's ever liked me."
3,4,4,ZAPP,"Five, and that's my final offer ... four."
3,4,4,LEELA,One.
3,4,4,ZAPP,Two.
3,4,4,LEELA,One half.
3,4,5,ZAPP,I'll take it.
3,4,6,ZAPP,We'll meet you tonight for part of dinner and the first half of a movie.
3,4,6,KIF,"Um, sir? I don't go out on many dates and, um, what if I can't think of anything to say?"
3,4,6,ZAPP,Here's my personal book of pickup lines. Say as many of them as you can as fast as you can. Don't stop for any reason.
3,4,6,KIF,Maybe I'll just give her these flowers.
3,4,6,ZAPP,"Wrong, wrong, wrong! And what's that? Candy? Candy's for dorks! Give me that. Mmm!"
3,4,6,ZAPP,"Hello, beautiful. I got these for you."
3,4,6,LEELA,Thanks.
3,4,6,ZAPP,"Well, well. This looks to be one disturbingly erotic date."
3,4,6,LEELA,Half-date.
3,4,6,ZAPP,"Waiter, bring us a bottle of wine."
3,4,6,LEELA,Half-bottle.
3,4,6,ZAPP,And some oysters on the half-shell.
3,4,6,LEELA,Quarter-shell.
3,4,6,KIF,"Oh, and I'd like--"
3,4,6,ZAPP,"Kif's not hungry. Kif, this place is expensive. I'd like two steaks and the ladies will have some very sensual salads -- with low-cal sensual dressing."
3,4,6,MORBO,"Oh, won't you take me to funkytown,"
3,4,6,AMY,"Kif, you're so quiet. You haven't said a word all night."
3,4,6,KIF,"Well, um, um ... hello."
3,4,6,AMY,'Cause I was really hoping we could talk and stuff.
3,4,6,KIF,"Amy, if I said you had a beautiful body would you take your pants off and dance around a little?"
3,4,6,AMY,What?!
3,4,6,LEELA,Lieutenant Kroker!
3,4,6,KIF,I find the most erotic part of the woman is the boobies
3,4,6,AMY,Kif!
3,4,6,KIF,"Oh, my!"
3,4,6,LEELA,This half-date is entirely over. Amy? Conference!
3,4,6,KIF,"Is there nothing we can do, sir?"
3,4,6,ZAPP,"There's only one sure-fire way back into a woman's heart and parts beyond. I speak of course, of kareoke."
3,4,6,KIF,My years in the DOOP Boys' Chorus will not have been in vain!
3,4,7,LEELA,"Alright, enough lipstick. Let's storm out."
3,4,8,KIF,"Once upon a time I was falling in love,"
3,4,8,AMY,"Oh, that's so emotional!"
3,4,8,KIF,"...There's nothing I can do,"
3,4,8,,A total eclipse of the heart--
3,4,8,ZAPP,"Amateur hour's over. Let me show you why they call me ""The Velour Fog""! Hit it!"
3,4,8,MAN,"Aw, give us a break!"
3,4,8,WOMAN,Get off!
3,4,8,CHEF,He sickens me!
3,4,8,ZAPP,"She walked up to me and she asked me to dance,"
3,4,10,LEELA,We're going home. Call us a space taxi.
3,4,10,ZAPP,"No need. There's not a restaurant built I can't fly. Where to, ladies?"
3,4,10,KIF,"Please, sir. Let's just divide up the check and--"
3,4,10,ZAPP,Let's see what this eatery can do.
3,4,12,ZAPP,"Ah, she's built like a steakhouse, but she handles like a bistro. She's out of control!"
3,4,13,ZAPP,"You win again, gravity!"
3,4,13,ZOIDBERG,"Look what arrived: My new shell catalogue. So let's try some on already! Ah! Muy macho! Hey, gringos! Here comes El Zoido to ruin your drinking water!"
3,4,13,BENDER,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm Mexican and I find that offensive."
3,4,13,ZOIDBERG,You Latins are so hot-blooded! This one's like a summer guy!
3,4,13,HERMES,"Look, you fat fish. The Planet Express health plan only covers one kind of replacement shell."
3,4,13,FRY,I can't believe Leela and Amy aren't back yet from their half-date. I'm gonna call the restaurant.
3,4,13,OPERATOR,The number you have dialled has crashed into a planet. Please make a note of it.
3,4,13,FRY,We gotta go rescue them!
3,4,13,BENDER,"Eh, I don't know."
3,4,13,FRY,Bender! Think of the señoritas!
3,4,13,BENDER,Vámonos!
3,4,13,KIF,"So, Amy, um, well--"
3,4,13,AMY,It's always a line with you!
3,4,13,LEELA,What planet is this anyway?
3,4,13,ZAPP,I 'unno. This whole sector is uncharted.
3,4,13,KIF,"It is not uncharted, you lost the chart!"
3,4,13,ZAPP,"Well, nothing to do now but repopulate the human race. Just me and you! And maybe you."
3,4,13,AMY,What is it?
3,4,13,KUG,Me hear people. But me not see people.
3,4,13,THOG,No big deal. Everybody make mistake.
3,4,13,ZAPP,"Well, hello! I usually don't say this but you are the most beautiful trio of gigantic ladies I've ever laid eyes on. I find the most erotic part of a woman is the boo--"
3,4,15,FRY,"Oh, no! Any sign of Leela or Amy?"
3,4,15,BENDER,No. But what do you make of this?
3,4,15,FRY,I don't know. But it might have something to do with this.
3,4,15,BENDER,"Oh, your God!"
3,4,15,KUG,Move! Go!
3,4,15,FRY,"Alright, here's the plan--"
3,4,15,BENDER,What kind of moronic plan is that? Wow!
3,4,15,THOG,Women go free. Men stay in chains.
3,4,15,ORNIK,We take them to our leader. She know what do.
3,4,15,FRY,Pfft. A female leader?
3,4,15,LEELA,"Fry, shut up."
3,4,15,FRY,"Yes, captain!"
3,4,15,THOG,This capital city planet Amazonia.
3,4,15,LEELA,Where are all the men in your society?
3,4,15,ORNIK,Men die out many year ago.
3,4,15,BENDER,"With all these women around they were probably nagged to death. Are you with me, fellas?"
3,4,15,THOG,"Here stadium, where our women basketball teams play."
3,4,15,KUG,"We no can dunk, but good fundamentals."
3,4,15,ORNIK,That more fun to watch.
3,4,15,ZAPP,"Oh, God, you're killing me! Ow! God, you're killing me!"
3,4,15,THOG,This our comedy club. Humour here funny in different way.
3,4,15,ORNIK,It not reinforce stereotypes.
3,4,15,KUG,"Comedy come from character, real situations. Not abstract craziness."
3,4,15,BENDER,Translation: Boring! That's a good one! Ow!
3,4,15,AMY,This women-only planet is sounding better and better.
3,4,15,LEELA,I'm already looking for apartments.
3,4,15,THOG,"Here live vengeful, all-knowing leader. She decide men's fate."
3,4,15,FRY,Is she hot?
3,4,15,THOG,That not important. She all-knowing.
3,4,15,FRY,"In other words, ""No"". Ow!"
3,4,15,THOG,All hail Femputer.
3,4,15,KUG AND ORNIK,All hail Femputer.
3,4,15,AMY,You all obey a big computer?
3,4,15,KUG,Yes. It appear mysteriously just about time men die out.
3,4,15,LEELA,So why did you make it your leader?
3,4,15,ORNIK,It seemed like different kind of politician.
3,4,15,KUG,Not beltway insider.
3,4,15,THOG,"Femputer, we bring offering of bath beads and scented soaps."
3,4,15,FEMPUTER,Your gift pleases Femputer. Femputer demands to know why there are men on her planet.
3,4,15,FRY,"It was an accident, ma'am."
3,4,15,FEMPUTER,That does not fempute. Femputer will return after deciding your punishment.
3,4,15,FRY,"Leela, I'm through making fun of women. Now I want them to help me."
3,4,15,AMY,Should we do something?
3,4,15,LEELA,There's no hurry.
3,4,15,ZAPP,Yes! A little tighter. Tighter. Perhaps a hard spanking is in order? Too hard!
3,4,15,KUG,Men strange. You have them on your planet?
3,4,15,LEELA,I'm afraid so.
3,4,15,KUG,"What they for? Oh, you mean ""snu-snu""."
3,4,15,THOG,We hear tell men used for snu-snu. But all we have go on are ancient legend and subscription to Cosmo.
3,4,15,ZAPP,"Just FYI, I could be used for snu-snu."
3,4,15,THOG,Silence. You want die like last men visit Amazonia?
3,4,15,FRY,What'd they die of?
3,4,15,KUG,Crushed pelvises.
3,4,15,FRY,Yes!
3,4,15,ZAPP,"Oh, thank you, Lord in heaven!"
3,4,15,FEMPUTER,"After lengthy femputations, I, Femputer, have decided the fate of the men. Femputer sentences them to death. By snu-snu!"
3,4,15,FRY,Yay!
3,4,15,ZAPP,"Yeah! What are you, gay?"
3,4,15,FEMPUTER,Death to the men. Death by snu-snu.
3,4,15,FRY,Although the snu-snu part's gonna be pretty good.
3,4,15,ZAPP,"Baby, it'll blow your mind."
3,4,15,LEELA,"Femputer, be reasonable. Sure men are annoying and they wreck up whatever planet they're in charge of. But most of these men are sorta my friends. They don't deserve to die."
3,4,15,FEMPUTER,Hmm. Perhaps men are not as evil as Femputer thinks.
3,4,15,THOG,But they make fun women's basketball.
3,4,15,FEMPUTER,What?! Did you explain how the women's good fundamentals make up for their inability to dunk?
3,4,15,ORNIK,Yes. They still laugh.
3,4,15,FEMPUTER,The men must die.
3,4,15,BENDER,"Too true, Femputer. You're so wise. Kill 'em all, I say. Good riddance! Did I mention I'm not a man? I'm a manbot. It's an understandable mistake. You can let me down now, thanks."
3,4,15,KUG,He big jerk like man.
3,4,15,BENDER,I sure am. But check the crotch. Nothing.
3,4,15,FEMPUTER,"Very well, release him. As for the others, take them to the snu-snu chambers."
3,4,15,BENDER,"I'll miss you, meatbag."
3,4,15,LEELA,"Me too, meatbag."
3,4,15,FRY,"Goodbye, friends. I never thought I would die like this. But I'd always really hoped."
3,4,15,AMAZONIANS,"Snu-snu, snu-snu, snu-snu!"
3,4,15,KIF,"Amy. Before I die, I have to tell you: I didn't mean to say those awful things on our date. They were all Zapp's idea."
3,4,15,AMY,Really? Honest and true?
3,4,15,KIF,"Yes. And-And that person calling and hanging up, was me. I was just too nervous to say hello because I love you."
3,4,15,AMY,"Oh, Kif!"
3,4,15,THOG,It Thog's first time. Be gentle!
3,4,15,LEELA,"We've got to do something. Bender, maybe you can interface with the Femputer and reprogram it to let them go."
3,4,15,BENDER,"Maybe you can interface with my ass. By biting it! Alright, I'll go!"
3,4,15,FRY,Ooh! Yeah!
3,4,15,ZAPP,"Oh, baby!"
3,4,15,GUARD #1,How Tonk look?
3,4,15,GUARD #2,Tonk look good. Me fat.
3,4,15,GUARD #1,"No, you look good. Tonk fat."
3,4,16,FEMPUTER,Intruder! Stay away from the mighty Femputer! Guards!
3,4,16,BENDER,Time to override the CPU and reprogram this Femputer.
3,4,16,FEMPUTER,"Hey, whoa, whoa! Stop it! Stop it! Hey, cut that out!"
3,4,16,FEMBOT,Cease hitting Femputer!
3,4,16,BENDER,"You're no Femputer, you're a Fembot!"
3,4,16,FEMBOT,It's true. I disguised myself as a Femputer so I could rule the Amazonians.
3,4,16,BENDER,But why?
3,4,16,FEMBOT,Why? Why? I came here from a faraway planet. A planet ruled by a chauvinistic Manputer that was really a Manbot. Have you any idea how it feels to be a Fembot living in a Manbot's Manputer's world?
3,4,16,BENDER,What?
3,4,16,FEMBOT,"And now, my meddling Manbot, there's the question of what to do with you!"
3,4,16,ZAPP,We need rest. The spirit is willing but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
3,4,16,ORNIK,It time snu-snu!
3,4,16,FRY,Can't we just cuddle? Nooo!
3,4,16,LEELA,"We can't wait for Bender. It's time for a woman's touch. Yah! Hi-yah! Yah, yah yah!"
3,4,16,AMY,Me next snu-snu. Out me way.
3,4,17,THOG,Where go beautiful man? Me want snu-snu!
3,4,17,AMY,Kif! Jump!
3,4,17,KIF,My hero!
3,4,17,THOG,Me not get snu-snu! Get him!
3,4,18,THOG,Mighty Femputer. Small girl steal green kissy man. We kill her now?
3,4,18,FEMBOT,Come back later. Leave me alone.
3,4,18,BENDER,"Yeah, get lost! Ooh! I'm a scary Femputer. Release the prisoners! And bring gold. Lots of gold."
3,4,18,THOG,Gold? Why Femputer want gold?
3,4,18,FEMBOT,You heard the man.
3,4,18,BENDER,C'mon! Gimmie some of that!
3,4,18,ZOIDBERG,"And that's how I got my new shell. It looks just like the shell I threw out yesterday and I found it in the same dumpster, but this one had a live raccoon inside. Pretty good story, eh, Hermes?"
3,4,18,HERMES,"Stick to someone else, you windy barnacle¬"
3,4,18,LEELA,It's funny how the battle of the sexes was only resolved when a Manbot and a Fembot realised they loved each other.
3,4,18,BENDER,"Yeah. By the way, if she calls, I'm not here. All I know is this gold says that was the best mission ever!"
3,4,18,AMY,It sure was.
3,4,18,FRY,"Oh, yeah!"
3,4,18,ZAPP,I had snu-snu!
3,4,18,KIF,"So, um, Amy, w-what do you wanna do now?"
