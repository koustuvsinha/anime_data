3,7,0,"""THAT'S LOBSTERTAINMENT""","By Patric M. Verrone Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
3,7,1,ROBOT,"So I says, ""Super collider? I just met her!"" And then they built the super collider. Thank you, you've been a great audience."
3,7,1,FLORP,"Humorbot 5.0, ladies and gentlemen. Our next stand-up's a veteran of four comedy traffic schools. Give it way up for Bobcat Zoidberg!"
3,7,1,FRY,Alright!
3,7,1,LEELA,Yeah!
3,7,1,BENDER,"Alright, Zoidberg!"
3,7,1,ZOIDBERG,"Earth. What a planet. On Earth, you enjoy eating a tasty clam. On my planet, clams enjoy eating a tasty you. Maybe I'm not yelling loud enough. On Earth, everybody is always looking for a giant squid. On my planet -"
3,7,1,BENDER,Reload.
3,7,1,ZOIDBERG,So these three parasitic worms bore into a human's head...
3,7,1,WOMAN,"Eww, gross."
3,7,1,ZOIDBERG,"...and they walk up to the bar and then - uh-oh. Wait, stop! I've got more! Oh."
3,7,1,ZOIDBERG,My whole life I worked on that act. And they hated it.
3,7,1,HERMES,"You're a crazy, penniless, lobster doctor. No combination of you should be a comedian."
3,7,1,ZOIDBERG,But comedy is in my valves. My Uncle Harold was a big Hollywood star back in the era of silent holograms.
3,7,1,LEELA,Your uncle was Harold Zoid?
3,7,1,ZOIDBERG,This I cannot deny.
3,7,1,FARNSWORTH,"Why, I've been a Harold Zoid fan since back when my hips were made of bone. As it happens, I still have some of my original 78s."
3,7,1,HERMES,"You're right, crabby. He's a hell of a lot funnier than you could ever be."
3,7,1,ZOIDBERG,"Maybe so, but perhaps if I wrote him and asked for a few hundred pointers..."
3,7,1,ZOIDBERG,"This letter has to be very personal, so I'm writing it in my own ink. Dear Uncle Zoid, Greetings from your long-lost nephew. Norm and Sam and Sadie's boy, remember? ..."
3,7,1,ZOIDBERG,"...Now I am the most important doctor at the delivery company where I work. But, sadly, my life is bereft of laughter."
3,7,2,ZOID,"I beg of you, Mr. Funny Uncle, teach me the comedy business. Sincerely, Zoidberg. Oy, isn't that nice? He took the time."
3,7,2,WOMAN,What's that scribbldy-gook?
3,7,2,ZOID,"This is a fan letter from my rich doctor nephew who just might be my ticket out of this flophouse, he might. Yeah, you'd better run. Dear Rich Doctor Nephew, I can help you be funny. The first funny thing you must do is put all of your money in the form of a cashier's cheque and come to Hollywood."
3,7,2,ZOIDBERG,"Sincerely, Harold Zoid. P.S. Cashier's cheque. Did you hear that? I'm going to Hollywood!"
3,7,3,TOUR GUIDE,"Welcome to Hollywood! I must warn you, there's no refund if you get discovered and leave the tour! I'm just kidding, that never happens. Now, to your right, you'll see 30th Century Fox Studios. Fox uses those searchlights to blind pilots, then film the resulting plane crashes."
3,7,3,BENDER,Neat!
3,7,3,TOUR GUIDE,"Ahead, you'll see the home of Mel Gibson, star of the hit film, Bravehead. And do we have any fans of Calculon, star of the robot soap opera All My Circuits?"
3,7,3,BENDER,"Oh, I am, me! Bender is!"
3,7,3,TOUR GUIDE,Then you'll wanna get a close look at his luxurious Bel-Air home.
3,7,3,BENDER,"Yes, I will."
3,7,4,CALCULON,Are you my new hot water heater?
3,7,4,BENDER,"No, I'm Bender. We met once, remember?"
3,7,4,CALCULON,Absolutely not.
3,7,4,BENDER,"Come on, don't you remember how much I was bugging you, don't you? 'Cause it was a lot, you remember, right?"
3,7,4,CALCULON,"Look, I'm programmed to be very busy. Unless you can heat water to 212 degrees, I'm not interested. Have you got an extra GOTO 10 line? I said I don't need a bender."
3,7,4,BENDER,Bender? That was the other guy. My name's Boiler.
3,7,4,CALCULON,"Nice work, Boiler."
3,7,4,BENDER,Thanks. And call me Bender.
3,7,4,ZOIDBERG,"That's where I'm meeting Uncle Zoid for lunch to discuss my Hollywood dreams. Next time you see me, don't be surprised if I've eaten."
3,7,5,ZOIDBERG,"Uncle Zoid, you're looking young enough to be throw back!"
3,7,5,ZOID,"Rich nephew, come over here and give your uncle a nice, big meal. So, here we are: A still-famous film comedian..."
3,7,5,ZOIDBERG,"...And a rich, respected doctor with many surviving patients."
3,7,5,ZOID,"Eating real food in a restaurant, as we both often do. So, you want to be a comedian, is it?"
3,7,5,ZOIDBERG,It's my lifelong dream.
3,7,5,ZOID,Well that dream dies now. You're unfunny and untalented. That's why you're perfect for drama.
3,7,5,ZOIDBERG,"Hmm, serious drama. Perhaps it is time to give up comedy."
3,7,5,ZOID,"I'm putting together a big drama picture right now, as we speak. The script is dynamite. I know because I wrote it myself. And with me directing and starring, I'll be back on top after 50 miserable years......uh, of fame."
3,7,5,ZOIDBERG,"Ah, fame. Where do I come in?"
3,7,5,ZOID,"This fame film has a juicy part for you, if you completely finance it with your doctor money. So, are you in?"
3,7,5,ZOIDBERG,"Uh, OK. How much do I have to invest?"
3,7,5,ZOID,"Oh, not much, not much, amilliondollars. Then it's settled. Another blockbuster Hollywood deal."
3,7,5,WAITER,What can I get you gentlemen?
3,7,5,ZOIDBERG,Is bread free?
3,7,5,WAITER,Yeah.
3,7,5,ZOIDBERG,We'll split an order.
3,7,5,BENDER,What's with Monstro?
3,7,5,FRY,He promised he'd give his Uncle Zoid a million bucks to make a movie.
3,7,5,ZOIDBERG,I've only been here a day and already I'm a Hollywood phoney.
3,7,5,BENDER,"Well, perhaps I could call on TVs Calculon to help, now that I'm in showbiz."
3,7,5,,[He turns around and shows the others the All My Circuits logo on the back of his jacket.
3,7,5,FRY,Since when have you been in the biz?
3,7,5,BENDER,"Long enough, little man. Long enough."
3,7,5,BENDER,"Calculon, as your hot water heater......I would be remiss if I didn't bring you scripts that could make you an international film star."
3,7,5,CALCULON,Of course. Tell me about the project.
3,7,5,ZOIDBERG,It's a movie.
3,7,5,CALCULON,Interesting. Tell me more.
3,7,5,BENDER,"Get this: For a scant $1 million investment, you can be the star."
3,7,5,CALCULON,And?
3,7,5,BENDER,"And, uh, I guarantee it'll win you an Oscar."
3,7,5,CALCULON,"An Oscar, you say? That would get me out of this festering rat's nest called ""television"" once and for all. Let me see the script. No, no I don't like the font. Wait! Harold Zoid? Was this written by the Harold Zoid?"
3,7,5,ZOIDBERG,Written and Xeroxed.
3,7,5,CALCULON,"Good heavens. A chance to work with the legendary Harold Zoid. He's one of my great idols. And, and you say you can guarantee me the Oscar?"
3,7,5,BENDER,I can guarantee anything you want.
3,7,5,CALCULON,Then I'll do it!
3,7,5,ZOIDBERG,Hooray!
3,7,5,BENDER,Here's your chequebook.
3,7,5,CALCULON,"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you our director, the legendary Harold Zoid!"
3,7,5,ZOID,"Thank you. A more classic movie plot there isn't: A son who does not want to follow in his father's business. And that business is being president of Earth, no less. The son, as it happens, is vice president."
3,7,5,BENDER,"That plot makes perfect sense, wink wink."
3,7,5,ZOIDBERG,"Bender, you said ""wink wink"" out loud."
3,7,5,BENDER,"No, I didn't. Raise middle finger."
3,7,5,ZOID,"Now, remember, and I can't stress this enough, this is a talkie. So I want the full gamut of emotions from every actor in every scene."
3,7,5,ZOIDBERG,"The Magnificent Three. Scene one, take one."
3,7,5,ZOID,"And, action!"
3,7,5,CALCULON,"Take back your gilded pen, Father. Signing bills into law was always your dream, not mine."
3,7,5,ZOID,"Cut! Cut! Cut it! I said this is a talkie, damnit! You've got to emote more! And you extras: Wave your arms and make faces. What is this, a morgue?"
3,7,5,ZOIDBERG,"The Magnificent Three. Scene 10, take"
3,7,5,ZOID,Action. And I mean circus-grade action.
3,7,5,CALCULON,"Sir, I call upon you not as a president but as a father."
3,7,5,ZOID,"Cut, cut, cut it! Would you show a little emotion? People, people, please. Just because it's a dramatic scene, doesn't mean you can't do a little comedy in the background. Throw a pie or two, for God's sake."
3,7,5,CALCULON,Nooo!
3,7,5,ZOID,"Cut, cut it! Eck! Look, look, it's alright, kid. We'll, uh, we'll get it in editing. Alright, that's a wrap everybody, I'm gonna see you all at the premiere which, by the way, when is?"
3,7,5,ZOIDBERG,"Well, uh, editing is a long and expensive process but we spent all the money on pies, so it'll be ready Friday."
3,7,5,BENDER,"Nice turnout, Calculon. That Oscar's practically on your mantel."
3,7,5,CALCULON,I just pray they like me half as much as I do.
3,7,5,CALCULON,"I agreed to be your vice president but I never agreed to be your son. Thank you, Lieutenant Smith."
3,7,5,ZOIDBERG,"Good morning, Mr. Vice President!"
3,7,6,FRY,"Leela, we're missing the premiere. My only goal in life was to attend a Hollywood shindig. Just pay the valet the two bucks."
3,7,6,LEELA,"No! It's the principle of the thing. Besides, I think I see a parking lot up ahead."
3,7,6,CALCULON,"Father, I have asked you to join me on the White House roof so we could have a heart-to-heart talk. I will never follow in your footsteps. Here is my resignation as vice president."
3,7,6,ZOID,"No! My son will not shame me like this. I would sooner die, I would!"
3,7,6,CALCULON,Father! The ledge!
3,7,6,ZOID,Oy!
3,7,6,CALCULON,Oh.
3,7,6,ZOIDBERG,"The president is dead. Congratulations, Mr. President."
3,7,6,CALCULON,Nooo!
3,7,6,BENDER,Woohoo! Yeah! He's a visionary!
3,7,6,CALCULON,Everyone walked out. They hated it. I've seen plagues that have better opening nights than this. You said that Oscar was practically on my mantel.
3,7,6,BENDER,"Now you know why I use the qualifier, ""practically""."
3,7,6,CALCULON,"You listen to me. I'm out a million bucks here! You get me that Oscar, or you're dead! You and these snivelling lobsters! Dead. You hear me? Dead!"
3,7,6,ZOID,"Oy, now he emotes!"
3,7,6,CALCULON,400 categories and not a single nomination for me.
3,7,6,ZOIDBERG,But you won this Golden Globe!
3,7,6,CALCULON,Piffle! That's the Emmy of movie awards! I told you I want an Oscar.
3,7,6,BENDER,Then maybe you should act better.
3,7,6,CALCULON,The Oscar isn't about acting. It's about earning the respect and admiration of the creative community.
3,7,6,ZOID,How 'bout we rig the awards?
3,7,6,CALCULON,That's fine too.
3,7,6,LEELA,"It's no use. The tar is too thick. Plus, I think I flooded it."
3,7,6,FRY,"Well, we missed the premiere and we're gonna die. We might as well enjoy the sights. Oh my God, Sylvester Stallone!"
3,7,6,ZOIDBERG,This is where you live? I though you were a big-shot Hollywood movie star.
3,7,6,ZOID,"No, I'm not. I'm an even bigger liar than you. My career went down the tube the day they invented smell-a-vision."
3,7,6,BENDER,Calculon's gonna kill us for sure. It's all everybody else's fault.
3,7,6,ZOID,Oy. All I wanted was for people to think of me one last time before I die.
3,7,6,ZOIDBERG,What are you talking about? Everybody remembers Harold Zoid!
3,7,6,ZOID,"As a pathetic has-been, they remember me. As a forgotten relic, they remember me. Bah! It's better to die now."
3,7,6,ZOIDBERG,No. This is one death Dr. Zoidberg won't be responsible for. Zoidberg away!
3,7,6,RIVERS,"Hi, I'm Joan Rivers's head. I tell you, I've had so many face-lifts, they finally lifted it right off my body! It's true, it's true! Oh, oh, oh, here comes Jack Nicholson's DNA, reconstituted in a gorilla body."
3,7,6,BENDER,Catering.
3,7,6,RIVERS,"Oh, and here's washed-up actor, what's-his-name, Harold Zoid. Are you presenting one of those tacky honorary awards, or just getting one?"
3,7,6,ZOID,"I'm a seat-filler, Joan's head. My only marketable skill is to occupy space."
3,7,6,CALCULON,"You know, the second I don't win that award, you're cat food. Right, Boxy?"
3,7,6,ANNOUNCER,"And now, the host of the 1074th Academy Awards, Billy Crystal."
3,7,6,CRYSTAL,"Now I know how a Pez dispenser feels. Alright, we're already one hour behind. Our first award tonight, Best Cinematography in a Non-Visible Spectrum."
3,7,6,FRY,It's been two weeks. You wanna play tic-tac-toe again before we eat our shoes?
3,7,6,LEELA,"Oh, I always knew I'd die at the bottom of a pit. But a pit full of tar?"
3,7,6,FRY,What was that? A tar dolphin or a tar shark?
3,7,6,LEELA,"It's some kind of hollow tube, devoid of human life. The Los Angeles subway! We can blast our way in and escape!"
3,7,6,FRY,"Alright, but I still feel like having a shoe."
3,7,6,ZOIDBERG,What category are they on?
3,7,6,BENDER,They're giving out the minor technical awards. I think they're up to writing.
3,7,6,ZOIDBERG,That leave Best Soft-Drink Product Placement and then Best Actor. We don't have much time.
3,7,6,CRYSTAL,And the nominees for Best Soft-Drink Product Placement are:
3,7,6,SLURM MACHINE,"Star Trek: The Pepsi Generation, They Call Me Mr. Pibb and Snow White And The 7 Ups."
3,7,6,BENDER,"And now, to present the award for Best Actor......a bit player in the flop movie The Magnificent Three......Dr. Zoidberg."
3,7,6,CALCULON,
3,7,6,ZOIDBERG,"And the nominees for Best Actor are: Sir Lawrence...... in The Merchant Of Venus, Hive Mind Gamma 7X in Bikini Party Summer, the Soda Machine Robot in Bikini Party Summer, Mark Jones in How Beige Was My Jacket and, instead of the fifth guy - Calculon, for his powerhouse performance in The Magnificent Three."
3,7,6,MAN #1,"Uh-oh, he read the wrong name."
3,7,6,MAN #2,"Shh, just play along, like they did with Marisa Tomei."
3,7,6,ZOID,"Hooray, I won't be murdered. I'll live another day. Another day of...pathetic, forgotten misery."
3,7,6,ZOIDBERG,"And the winner is... And the winner, instead of any of the nominees, is the legendary Harold Zoid!"
3,7,6,ZOID,"Thank you. Thank you so much! You know, through all my ups and downs, I always thought the most important thing in life was to win an Oscar. But tonight I realise what's really important is to win two Oscars. Ha, ha! I'm kidding, I'm kidding. What really matters in life is that people care about you, whether it's a whole crowd......or just one die-hard fan."
3,7,6,,[He looks at Zoidberg. The audience claps and Jack Nicholson swings from a chandelier.
3,7,6,ZOID,"Thank you, nephew. Now I can die happy. 10 seconds from now, when Calculon kills us."
3,7,6,CALCULON,Harold Zoid!
3,7,6,BENDER,Hit the deck!
3,7,6,CALCULON,Where's that Oscar?
3,7,6,ZOID,"Here, enjoy. What are you getting upset? It's slightly less fraudulent for you to have it."
3,7,6,CALCULON,"Yes, yes it's a real beauty. Someday I hope to win one of my own."
3,7,6,BENDER,"Then you're not going to kill us, Your Majesty?"
3,7,6,CALCULON,Nay. I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.
3,7,6,ZOIDBERG,Earthquake!
3,7,6,BENDER,Hit the deck!
3,7,6,ZOID,"Let the earth quake, I've got somebody's Oscar!"
3,7,6,FRY,We made it! I'm at a Hollywood party!
3,7,6,DOORMAN,"I'm sorry, sir, this is a private - oh, pardon me, I see you're with Mr. Stallone."
