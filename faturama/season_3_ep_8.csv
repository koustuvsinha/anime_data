3,8,0,"""THE BIRDBOT OF ICECATRAZ""","By Dan Vebber Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
3,8,0,LEELA,"Fry, I know those cookies are fresh-a-licious but they produce an awful lot of trash."
3,8,0,BENDER,Ah!
3,8,0,LEELA,"And Bender, that aerosol head spray makes your head smell nice..."
3,8,0,BENDER,Thank you.
3,8,0,LEELA,...but it's doing long-term damage to the planet.
3,8,0,BENDER,So? It's not like it's the only one we've got!
3,8,0,FARNSWORTH,Good news everyone! I'm sending you on an extremely controversial mission!
3,8,0,FRY,Controversial?
3,8,0,FARNSWORTH,Oh my no.
3,8,0,FARNSWORTH,"For this highly controversial mission, you'll be towing the Juan Valdez, an orbitting supertanker full of rich Columbian dark matter."
3,8,0,LEELA,Dark matter oil? What if we hit something? The tanker could leak!
3,8,0,FARNSWORTH,"Impossible! The tanker has 6000 hulls. So, unlike me, it's entirely leak-proof! Now, once you've hauled the tanker past the protestors -"
3,8,0,LEELA,Protestors?
3,8,0,FARNSWORTH,Correct. 6000 hulls.
3,8,0,LEELA,Why do we have to fly within three feet of this penguin preserve on Pluto?
3,8,0,FARNSWORTH,To avoid the tollbooth.
3,8,0,FRY,"Alright, she's all restocked with emergency jam. Let's get going."
3,8,0,LEELA,"At the risk of sounding negative: No! Look Professor, I can't participate in this mission."
3,8,0,FARNSWORTH,What are you yapping about?
3,8,0,LEELA,"This time it's your reckless disregard for the environment. In fact, I'm gonna go join those protestors."
3,8,0,FARNSWORTH,This is an outrage. I demand that you hand over your captain's jacket.
3,8,0,LEELA,This is my normal jacket. I've had it for 10 years.
3,8,0,FARNSWORTH,"I said hand it over! Well Fry, or should I say Captain Fry? No I shouldn't. Because Bender is the new captain!"
3,8,0,FRY,Bender?
3,8,0,FARNSWORTH,"That's right. Being a captain is about intuition and heart. A good captain can't have either one. That's why cold, logical Bender is perfect for the job."
3,8,0,BENDER,"Well, I do think of human life as expendable."
3,8,0,FRY,No fair. Leela was training me to be captain. She even let me sit in her lap and steer - in this comic I drew.
3,8,0,ZOIDBERG,"Ooo, the new one's out!"
3,8,0,BENDER,"Fry, the title of captain may inflate the human ego, but it's beneath the notice of my mighty robo-logic! Now look spry men! We launch at six bells!"
3,8,1,WATERFALL SR,"Greetings Econauts. I'm Free Waterfall Sr, founder of Penguins Unlimited. Whoa! No, no! No applause. Every time you clap your hands you kill thousands of spores that'll some day form a nutritious fungus. Just show your approval with a mould-friendly thumbs up! Please hold your thumbs until the end. Now folks, its time to stop that tanker with a non-violent human circle."
3,8,1,LEELA,Why do we have to resort to non-violence? Can't we just kick their asses?
3,8,1,WATERFALL SR,"Now little lady, those people's asses are living things too!"
3,8,2,BENDER,Aye! We're hitched up tighter than Davy Jones' U-Haul! At ease men!
3,8,2,FRY,I am at ease.
3,8,2,BENDER,"Mr Fry. I like to give my first mate an informal nickname. From now on, you will be known as...Wiggles!"
3,8,2,WIGGLES,The hell I will! Have you even read the captain's handbook?
3,8,2,BENDER,I have now. And what's Peter Parrot's first rule of captaining?
3,8,2,WIGGLES,Always respect the chain-o-command - captain.
3,8,2,BENDER,Correct Wiggles. You've just earned an invitation to the captain's table.
3,8,2,ZOIDBERG,The captain's table! What an honour!
3,8,2,WATERFALL SR,Our peace ring has 'em trapped like a tiger in a washing machine!
3,8,2,LEELA,Get ready!
3,8,2,PROTESTOR #1,Look out!
3,8,2,PROTESTOR #2,Hold on!
3,8,2,WATERFALL SR,Here they come.
3,8,2,LEELA,"When you were planning this peace ring, didn't you realise spaceships can move in three dimensions?"
3,8,2,WATERFALL SR,No I did not.
3,8,2,WATERFALL SR,"Folks, that tanker gave us the slip but we'll stop 'em here on Pluto! If you're cold, rub your bodies with permafrost. It's nature's long johns. If rubbing frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right!"
3,8,2,WATERFALL SR,This here is our penguin preserve.
3,8,2,LEELA,Aww they're so cute! They're like if puppies and kittens could have babies!
3,8,2,WATERFALL SR,We use hand puppets around young uns to simulate a natural environment.
3,8,2,LEELA,That's adorable.
3,8,3,BENDER,"...But I suppose it's this medal I'm most proud of Wiggles. I won it for saving the children of Earth from a giant kangaroo. It was on the Australian news, you probably didn't see it."
3,8,3,ZOIDBERG,Brilliant!
3,8,3,FRY,Would you cram a sock in it Bender? Those aren't even medals! They're bottlecaps and pepperoni slices.
3,8,3,BENDER,Thank you steward. Wiggles? Weren't you about to propose a toast to your gallant captain?
3,8,3,FRY,"Fine, I've got a toast. To Captain Bender! He's the best......at being a big jerk and his big ugly face is as dumb as a butt."
3,8,3,BENDER,"Eh, I've heard better."
3,8,3,FRY,If I were in charge I wouldn't treat you like this. You're nothing but a big blowhard.
3,8,3,BENDER,"Sir, you forget yourself! Shut up!"
3,8,3,FRY,Being captain is obviously more important to you than being my friend. I'm going.
3,8,3,BENDER,"Going? But, a captain can't drink without his first mate!"
3,8,3,ZOIDBERG,You can drink with me maybe?
3,8,3,BENDER,I don't feel like drinking.
3,8,3,ZOIDBERG,Then if you'll excuse me I see some ravioli that only has two shoeprints on it. Three.
3,8,4,BENDER,"Oh Greenland is a barren land, a land that bears no green. Where there's ice and snow and the whale fishies blow and the -"
3,8,4,ZOIDBERG,"Captain please, have some liquor. You robots need alcohol to function."
3,8,4,BENDER,Gah! I once knew a guy...you look like him. But he wasn't either. I'm a good captain.
3,8,4,ZOIDBERG,"Please sir, I love you like a father!"
3,8,4,PROTESTOR #3,"Here they come, oh I hope they read my sign!"
3,8,4,LEELA,Bender's flying too low! And he's upside-down!
3,8,4,PROTESTOR #3,He must be talking on a cell phone!
3,8,5,FRY,What's happening?
3,8,5,ZOIDBERG,All 6000 hulls have been breached!
3,8,5,FRY,Oh the fools! If only they'd built it with 6001 hulls! When will they learn?
3,8,6,LINDA [ON TV],Continuing our coverage of a tragic - but far away - story. The crisis on Pluto worsens as dark matter spreads throughout the penguin habitat. The images are truly horrific.
3,8,6,LEELA [ON TV],"I don't think any of those poor, oil-drenched penguins feel."
3,8,6,MORBO [ON TV],"Oily humanoid! At the time of the crash, the tanker captain had an alcohol level of .08 percent - well below the legal limit for robots."
3,8,6,HYPER-CHICKEN,"Son, as your lawyer I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal; Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ole mess you caused."
3,8,6,BENDER,Five hours? Aw man! Couldn't you have just gotten me the death penalty?
3,8,6,HYPER-CHICKEN,I'd have done better but it's plum hard pleadin' a case while awaitin' trial for that there incompetance!
3,8,6,BENDER,"Yeah, uh, good luck with that."
3,8,7,LEELA,Now you stay away from those puffin twins.
3,8,7,WATERFALL SR,Good way to avoid frostbite folks: Put your hands between your buttocks. That's nature's pocket.
3,8,7,LEELA,Uh...I think I'll go check on Bender.
3,8,7,WATERFALL SR,Watch that he doesn't pick your pocket.
3,8,8,BENDER,"Ah, can't beat fresh squeezed!"
3,8,8,LEELA,"Bender, can you at least pretend you're being punished? And clean the black parts too."
3,8,8,SMITTY,Are they black with white feathers or white with black feathers?
3,8,8,URL,"It don't matter baby, they're all beautiful!"
3,8,8,BENDER,"Yo, screws, more Tegrin over here? Oh ho, what's this?"
3,8,8,URL,"Aww man, he got away!"
3,8,8,SMITTY,I guess this is why chief says no hugging.
3,8,8,WATERFALL SR,"Good work everyone. I suggest you all go get some sleep. Me, well I'm gonna stay up all night singing songs about penguins in a fine piercing tenor."
3,8,8,LEELA,Has anyone seen Bender? Bender? Here robot robot robot.
3,8,8,LEELA,"Hey, why weren't you Kong donkeys outside cleaning up?"
3,8,8,ZOIDBERG,They sent us inside for doing an unsatisfactory job. And eating penguin eggs.
3,8,8,FRY,"You ate most of them. So, where's Captain Bender? Off catastrophising some other planet?"
3,8,8,ZOIDBERG,"Dammit Fry! He may have done wrong, but he's still your captain."
3,8,8,LEELA,I'm worried about him. He didn't come back with the group.
3,8,8,FRY,He didn't?
3,8,8,LEELA,No. And with windchill it's 20 degrees below absolute zero. I'd better go find him.
3,8,8,FRY,"Wait. Let me. Bender and I have our disagreements, but we're still friends and I'm gonna show him what that means. To the ship."
3,8,8,LEELA,Why don't you just walk? He was only about 20 yards from here.
3,8,8,FRY,"Madam, I am in command now."
3,8,8,ZOIDBERG,Such a man. I'd follow him to hell and back I would.
3,8,8,BENDER,What the? What's this water made of? Ice? Forget this!
3,8,8,PENGUIN #1,Full of fish?
3,8,8,BENDER,Not entirely.
3,8,8,PENGUIN #1,Then let's fish.
3,8,8,ZOIDBERG,"Captain, I don't think we're on Pluto any longer. In fact, we may have left space as we know it."
3,8,8,FRY,Then where are we? You said you knew how to navigate.
3,8,8,ZOIDBERG,Stop yelling at me!
3,8,8,WATERFALL SR,"Folks it's worse than we thought. Seems dark matter is nature's sex drug. It's like a perverted trail mix of penguin estrogen, penguin Viagra and Spanish penguin fly. Why, it's making them ultra-fertile."
3,8,8,LEELA,How ultra?
3,8,8,WATERFALL SR,Well your garden variety penguin lays one egg a year. Since the spill our penguins have been laying six eggs every 15 minutes. Also the eggs hatch in only 12 hours. Also the males are laying eggs.
3,8,8,DOCTOR,This man is over-gasped.
3,8,8,WATERFALL SR,If the birds keep multiplying soon there'll be too many to count. Before long they'll exhaust their food supply and starve to death.
3,8,8,LEELA,"Oh if only we hadn't flown penguins to Pluto and dumped oil on them, this might never have happened. Can't we stop them from multiplying?"
3,8,8,WATERFALL SR,Yes I reckon it is our responsibility. And thankfully we have a plan.
3,8,8,LEELA,What is it? We'll do anything.
3,8,8,WATERFALL SR,Everyone grab your guns. I declare penguin hunting season officially open.
3,8,9,LEELA,You can't shoot penguins. Isn't there some way to prevent them from breeding?
3,8,9,WATERFALL SR,Cold showers don't work on Antarctic creatures. Now surely you agree that a quick semi-painless death is a darn sight better than weeks of starvation.
3,8,9,LEELA,"Well...I suppose...but...I mean...I joined Penguins Unlimited to love penguins, not to hunt them."
3,8,9,WATERFALL SR,This time the two are one and the same! Now are you with us or are you gonna let innocent penguins suffer?
3,8,9,LEELA,Oh God it's inhuman! It's like Hong Kong! I'll do it!
3,8,9,WATERFALL SR,That's a good old fashioned gun. Simple point-and-click interface. Rifle check!
3,8,9,HUNTER #1,Oh yeah!
3,8,9,HUNTER #2,Wee doggy!
3,8,9,LEELA,"Hey, you're enjoying this."
3,8,9,WATERFALL SR,"Look nobody enjoys shooting penguins. But if you have to shoot penguins, well you might as well enjoy it."
3,8,9,LEELA,I'm sorry but if it's fun in any way it's not environmentalism.
3,8,9,WATERFALL SR,Oh really? How 'bout blowing up dams?
3,8,9,LEELA,Yeah...that is fun.
3,8,9,WATERFALL SR,Let's conservate!
3,8,9,ZOIDBERG,It's been an honour to serve under you sir!
3,8,9,LEELA,"Alright, this is for their own good. Don't leave orphans. Gotta kill entire families. But they're so cute. No! You can do this. It's just like murdering a little butler. I...I can't look. Oh no! What have I done? Oh you poor little guy! I'm so sorry I - Bender? What's going on? Were you hiding out with these little guys?"
3,8,9,BENDER,Of course not. Filthy ice rats. Scat! Shoo! Gah! What are you doing? Get away!
3,8,9,LEELA,"Aww, they love you!"
3,8,9,BENDER,"Well I don't love them. Aww! I don't know why but when I look down at their little faces, it makes me wanna puke! In a good way!"
3,8,9,PENGUINS,Stand still. It's our only hope.
3,8,9,BENDER,That's Puffin talk. Now follow me!
3,8,9,LEELA,"Stop! Stop shooting! It's me, Leela."
3,8,9,HUNTER #2,Sorry.
3,8,9,WATERFALL SR,Why aren't you firing randomly into those birds little lady? Don't you wanna help 'em?
3,8,9,LEELA,Not this way.
3,8,9,WATERFALL SR,What? Why you're not a tree-hugging kook at all!
3,8,9,LEELA,"Look, I don't know if shooting penguins will help the environment or not. But I do know that the decision shouldn't be in the hands of people who just wanna kill for fun."
3,8,9,WATERFALL SR,"Leela, you may just be farming some free-range truth there. On the other hand we just made up 200 pounds of batter for penguin tempura. OK boys, it's them or us!"
3,8,9,LEELA,No!
3,8,9,WATERFALL SR,Hey where'd they - ?
3,8,9,BENDER,Attack!
3,8,9,HUNTER #1,Whoa!
3,8,9,HUNTER #2,Ow!
3,8,9,BENDER,We will fight them on the beaches! We will fight them on the glaciers!
3,8,9,WATERFALL SR,Make sure they use every part of my body!
3,8,9,OLD MAN WATERFALL,I'll avenge your death son!
3,8,9,LEELA,They used to be such peaceful birds. I suppose this was your doing.
3,8,9,BENDER,"Yep. It's like I taught 'em. If it ain't black and white - peck scratch and bite! Now to take off my tuxedo. Guys, it's me! Your lovable dictator! Uh-oh!"
3,8,9,LEELA,"Oh, if only we had a toboggan."
3,8,9,BENDER,Faster! Faster!
3,8,9,LEELA,Phew!
3,8,9,BENDER,Oh phew! Oh right they can swim. It's all coming back to me now.
3,8,9,LEELA,It's Fry!
3,8,9,BENDER,Wiggles?
3,8,9,LEELA,"Well, at least it'll help reduce their population."
3,8,9,BENDER,"Yeah, life is hilariously cruel. Permission to come aboard Wiggles?"
3,8,9,FRY,Granted. We can't take off without our captain.
3,8,9,BENDER,"Oh, and bring my toboggan."
3,8,9,FRY,"So Leela, were you able to help the penguins?"
3,8,9,LEELA,Well sure. I mean...not really...I mean...nature will work itself out. It can't screw things up any worse than we did trying to fix things right?
3,8,9,FRY,I 'unno.
3,8,9,BENDER,"Ah, quit your worrying. Thanks to my shining influence those stupid birds'll do just fine."
