3,9,0,MRS FRY,This is the happiest day of my life!
3,9,0,DOCTOR,Here's your baby ma'am.
3,9,0,MRS FRY,Yeah OK thanks.
3,9,0,MR FRY,"So, what should we name him?"
3,9,0,MRS FRY,"Uh, you pick. I picked dinner last night."
3,9,0,MR FRY,"Well, I was thinking Philip. After those screwdrivers?"
3,9,0,MRS FRY,That's a fantastic idea. More morphine please.
3,9,0,MR FRY,"Look Yancy, its your baby brother Philip."
3,9,0,YANCY,I wanna be named Philip! Me Philip! Me Philip!
3,9,0,MR FRY,"Son your name is Yancy, just like me and my grandfather and so on. All the way back to minuteman Yancy Fry, who blasted commies in the American Revolution. Philip, until I find a suitable model of an ICBM you'll have to make do learnin' to fear this toy spacecraft."
3,9,0,YANCY,Mine! Mine!
3,9,0,FRY,C'mon!
3,9,0,HERMES,Baby needs a new pair of shoes!
3,9,0,ZOIDBERG,"To hell with your spoiled baby, I need those shoes!"
3,9,0,FARNSWORTH,No fair! You changed the outcome by measuring it.
3,9,0,LEELA,How'd you do Fry?
3,9,0,FRY,I'll tell you when my horse finishes...bad.
3,9,1,MR WONG,In today's field we own four horses and two jockeys.
3,9,1,MRS WONG,"We just put our best jockey out to stud Amy, he's perfect for you!"
3,9,1,JOCKEY,"Hey baby, ever do it in a suitcase?"
3,9,2,BENDER,Ooo look! It's the centaur race!
3,9,2,FRY,"Come on, come on! Hey Leela, how 'bout a kiss for good luck? I meant tongue luck."
3,9,2,FRY,I am so unlucky! I've run over black cats that were luckier than me.
3,9,2,MAN,"Get your piping hot horse burgers, horse fries, horse cake and shakes. We got tongue straight from the horse's mouth."
3,9,2,LEELA,Hmm.
3,9,2,HERMES,It all sounds good.
3,9,2,MAN,All our horses are 100% horse fed for that double juiced in horse goodness.
3,9,2,LEELA,I'll have a cholesterol free omelette with horse beaters.
3,9,2,MAN,"And you sir, how can I horse you?"
3,9,2,HERMES,I'll have a horse coke.
3,9,2,MAN,Horse Pepsi OK?
3,9,2,HERMES,Neigh.
3,9,2,JOCKEY,Hey what are you doing?
3,9,2,BENDER,This.
3,9,2,FRY,"Dear Horse God, I know I don't usually pray to you, sometimes I doubt you even exist. But if you're willing to grant me luck, please, stamp your hoof once. Come on number six move it! Don't do that! What are you - Man it's contagious!"
3,9,2,BENDER,That'll teach those other horses to take drugs!
3,9,2,FRY,"That's it! You can only take my money for so long before you take it all, and I say enough. I've got one dollar left, and this one I'm holding onto! Oh no you don't! I may not know much about horses but I know a lot about doing anything for one dollar! If you think bad luck can defeat me then you don't know my name is Philip J -"
3,9,3,MAN,That is one unlucky guy!
3,9,3,FRY,Kareem's got the skyhook but Philip J. Fry's got the spacehook!
3,9,3,YANCY,"Yancy drives, he goes up with his patented spacehook!"
3,9,3,FRY,Hey. That's my patented spacehook! You stole it!
3,9,3,YANCY,You're not the president of it!
3,9,3,FRY,Holy camolie! A seven leaf clover!
3,9,3,YANCY,I'm dying of old age!
3,9,3,FRY,Phil wins! Yancy's fans are stunned! There'll be no celebration at the Yancy dome!
3,9,3,YANCY,Lucky.
3,9,3,LEELA,Well someone's in a good mode.
3,9,3,BENDER,Let's just say I lucked out at the track! Also I rigged one race.
3,9,3,FRY,Pah. I'd have won a lot of money too if I still had my lucky seven leaf clover. Plus I'd still have my hair.
3,9,3,HAIRBOT,"I got your page Mr Fry, your new hair is ready!"
3,9,3,AMY,So whatever happened to this seven leaf clover?
3,9,3,FRY,I hid it in a secret hiding place who's location I never told anyone. Not even Scruffy.
3,9,3,ZOIDBERG,So the clover is still in the hiding place maybe?
3,9,3,FRY,Hey yeah! Maybe it is still there! Underground in the ruins of Old New York. Helping some ant defeat another ant or helping some piece of dirt turn it's luck around.
3,9,3,FARNSWORTH,Dirt doesn't need luck.
3,9,3,FRY,I'm going down there to get my clover back. Now some of the tunnels have metal bars so I'll need someone who's good at bending. Leela how 'bout you?
3,9,3,LEELA,Sure I'll do it.
3,9,3,BENDER,Like hell you will. Bending's my middle name.
3,9,3,FRY,It is?
3,9,3,BENDER,Yep. My full name is Bender Bending Rodriguez
3,9,3,FRY,Here's the entrance. From this moment on I declare my bad luck officially over.
3,9,3,BENDER,He was fun.
3,9,3,LEELA,Well if we get bored I've got Tetris on this thing.
3,9,3,FRY,"Look, up ahead."
3,9,3,BENDER,Old New York. The city that inspired a casino in Las Vegas.
3,9,3,FRY,"Wow! We've got Manhattan all to ourselves! I can finally do all the crazy stuff I always dreamed of doing! Howard Stern s overrated! Uh, oops!"
3,9,3,BENDER,New York is so burned.
3,9,3,FRY,And remember when Mayor Giuliani cracked down on jaywalking?
3,9,3,LEELA,No.
3,9,3,FRY,"Well Rudy, how'd you like this action?"
3,9,3,GUY #1,"As you know the big breakdance is Saturday. So if we wanna win those Jam Master J autographed parachute pants our crew has to pop, lock and bust the freshest. Noticwably F.A.T., drop us a beat. Name?"
3,9,3,FRY,Cosmic F.
3,9,3,GUY #1,Style?
3,9,3,FRY,Outer space.
3,9,3,GUY #1,Special moves?
3,9,3,FRY,The moonwalk...the robot...the zero
3,9,3,GUY #1,Name?
3,9,3,YANCY,Cosmic Y.
3,9,3,GUY #1,Style?
3,9,3,YANCY,"Uh, deep space!"
3,9,3,FRY,Deep space??
3,9,3,GUY #1,Special moves?
3,9,3,YANCY,The spacewalk...
3,9,3,FRY,Hey!
3,9,3,YANCY,...The robot...
3,9,3,FRY,The robot? That's similar to mine!
3,9,3,YANCY,The zero G!
3,9,3,FRY,What are you doing? You totally ripped off my routine.
3,9,3,YANCY,You callin' me a biter?
3,9,3,FRY,Why do you always have to steal everything from me Yancy? Find your own life and live it.
3,9,3,YANCY,Stop illin'! Word!
3,9,3,FRY,Well I'd like to see you try and steal this. the septuple head spin.
3,9,3,YANCY,He's just scratching. No one's ever done more than a quadruple.
3,9,3,FRY,"Oh yeah? Noticeably F.A.T., rewind the tape."
3,9,3,GUY #1,Crazy sucker!
3,9,3,GUY #2,"Phil, you're hot!"
3,9,3,NOTICEABLY F.A.T.,That was ice cold bro!
3,9,3,GUY #1,"Fry if I ever see you try anything that crazy again, this crew might just have some new parachute pants!"
3,9,3,YANCY,Stop hogging the clover.
3,9,3,FRY,"Alright team, let's go find that clover!"
3,9,3,LEELA,Which way to your house? The sign says we're at 71st street.
3,9,3,FRY,"71st street? Hmm, never heard of it. Downtown could be in any direction."
3,9,3,BENDER,"No sweat, we'll just take a spin on the B-train!"
3,9,4,BENDER,Ooo that feels funny! This is the Brooklyn bound B-train making local stops at wherever the hell I feel like. Watch for the closing doors.
3,9,4,BENDER,Wake up buddy end of the line!
3,9,4,FRY,"Gosh my old neighbourhood! That's the bench where I found some shirts! That fire hydrant! In summer we'd light it on fire! On that corner, some guy with a bushy beard handed out a socialist newsletter!"
3,9,4,BENDER,Was it poorly xeroxed?
3,9,4,FRY,You'd better believe it!
3,9,4,LEELA,"The old comedians were right, this place is a lot different from LA!"
3,9,4,MUTANT,Pardon me but did I overhear you saying you used to live here?
3,9,4,FRY,That's right.
3,9,4,MUTANT,Did you know Andy Goldman?
3,9,4,FRY,"Yeah, he was my neighbour. Why?"
3,9,4,MUTANT,I mutated from him!
3,9,4,FRY,Get out of here! What's Andy up to these days?
3,9,4,ANDY,The short answer is I'm teaching.
3,9,4,LEELA,He seemed nice.
3,9,4,FRY,Sure when he's sober!
3,9,4,FRY,Holy camolies! The house I grew up in! It's still there!
3,9,4,BENDER,"Man, father time really took a bat to this place."
3,9,4,YANCY,That stupid clover is a worthless piece of garbage! Give it give it give it!
3,9,5,FRY,Mom! Help!
3,9,5,MRS FRY,Yes!
3,9,5,FRY,"Mom, Yancy's trying to steal my clover."
3,9,5,MRS FRY,"Yancy, stealing is wrong."
3,9,5,YANCY,I'm gonna pile drive you! You're dead meat!
3,9,6,MR FRY,What's happenin' up there? Did Kremlin Joe let fly with the nukes?
3,9,6,FRY,Not yet commander. Yancy's just trying to steal my stuff as usual.
3,9,6,MR FRY,Well he'd better keep his hands off these bananas. Gonna need them when the radiation turns us all into monkeys.
3,9,6,FRY,The Ronco Record Vault! Yancy'll never get his hands on you in here or my money back. Ah The Breakfast Club soundtrack! Man I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Stay safe clover. I may need you again someday.
3,9,6,FRY,This was the storage room. My dad spent years turning it into a bomb shelter.
3,9,6,LEELA,And yet you guys never had a single nuclear war.
3,9,6,BENDER,What a waste.
3,9,6,FRY,This is it! My Ronco Record Vault! I still remember the combination. Three. It's stuck.
3,9,6,BENDER,The Achilles heel of the Ronco design is it's structural resonance frequency. Allow me. There we go!
3,9,6,FRY,Here it is. The Breakfast Club soundtrack.
3,9,6,BENDER,You mean breakfast club sandwich?
3,9,6,FRY,I hid my seven leaf clover in this very record jacket so my brother Yancy wouldn't get it. Here goes. It's gone! the whole place has been cleaned out! Yancy stole my clover! That thief!
3,9,6,LEELA,How do you know it didn't disintergrate?
3,9,6,FRY,Everything else in here held up OK.
3,9,6,BENDER,Except Sports by Huey Lewis.
3,9,6,FRY,I don't know why my brother hated me so much.
3,9,6,LEELA,"Aw, brothers always fight. I'm sure deep down he loved you. He just never got a chance to say it before you got frozen."
3,9,6,FRY,You think? 'Cause I always kinda wished that -
3,9,6,BENDER,Who is that God-like figure?
3,9,6,FRY,It's my brother Yancy! And there in his lapel - my seven leaf clover! I knew he stole it.
3,9,6,LEELA,Hold the phone. If that's Yancy then why does the inscription read Philip J. Fry?
3,9,6,FRY,Wait a second! That's my name! Good Lord. He ditched his goofy name and stole mine!
3,9,6,BENDER,"Apparently this brave adonis, this cadillac of men, was the first person on Mars."
3,9,6,FRY,"First person on Mars?? I should have been the first person on Mars! He stole my clover, he stole my name and he stole my life! And now he broke my hand."
3,9,6,BENDER,His legend lives on.
3,9,6,FARNSWORTH,So you opened the record vault and the clover was gone?
3,9,6,BENDER,"Yep, nothing in there but all the best music of the 1980's in one amazing collection."
3,9,6,LEELA,"Survivor, Pat Benetar, The Scorpions. The list goes on."
3,9,6,FRY,That clover helped my ratfink brother steal my dream of going into space. Now I'll never get there.
3,9,6,LEELA,You went there this morning for doughnuts.
3,9,6,HERMES,First person on Mars? Oh so your brother was that Philip J. Fry!
3,9,6,FRY,I'm Philip J. Fry! He stole my name after I got frozen.
3,9,6,FARNSWORTH,"Shut up friends. My internet browser heard us saying the word ""Fry"" and it found a movie about Philip J. Fry for us. It alwso opened my calendar to Friday and ordered me some French fries."
3,9,6,FRY,That should have been me!
3,9,6,FRY,That's my clover! Yancy stole it!
3,9,6,FRY,That's what I'm known for!
3,9,6,MAN [IN MOVIE],"Phil came in right, sturmmed out this tune yeah. And I said ""That's a number one record!"""
3,9,6,FRY,"So that's where my clover is? Hey, is that orbitting cemetary near here?"
3,9,6,LEELA,It will be in a couple hours.
3,9,6,FRY,"Good. Leela, Bender, we're going graverobbing."
3,9,6,BENDER,I'll get my kit.
3,9,6,YANCY,Thanks for lending me your tux Dad. It'll be perfect for my wedding.
3,9,6,MR FRY,"Yancy, that tux got me through Nam in style! I just wish your brother were still around to see this."
3,9,6,MRS FRY,I'll never forget the day Philip disappeared. Wisconsin won the rose bowl 17-9. Oh I miss him.
3,9,6,YANCY,Oh that reminds me. I was thinking of rummaging through Phil's records for something to play at the wedding.
3,9,6,MRS FRY,Have a look downstairs. Your brother may be missing but his crap sure isn't.
3,9,6,YANCY,"Hmm Breakfast Club, this'll clear out the room at the end of the reception."
3,9,7,LEELA,They buried your brother in the world heroes section? I'm impressed.
3,9,7,FRY,I should be the one in that grave!
3,9,7,FRY,Hmm. We lost Bender.
3,9,7,BENDER,There. Now no one will be able to say I don't own John Larroquette's spine!
3,9,7,FRY,Aha! My brother's grave!
3,9,7,LEELA,"Philip Fry, the original Martian."
3,9,7,FRY,"It's all lies every word of it! He wasn't original, he wasn't a Martian, he wasn't Philip Fry and since when is he a the?"
3,9,7,BENDER,You're twice the the he ever was.
3,9,7,FRY,It's clovering time!
3,9,7,,[Fade to: Yancy's House. Yancy's wife nurses a baby while Yancy stands over them.
3,9,7,YANCY'S WIFE,"So, had any ideas for names Yancy?"
3,9,7,YANCY,"Uh, I'm sorta thinking one. Daddy has a present for you today. Do you know what it is? It's a lucky clover that can help you be successful at anything you do - even breakdancing - and it once belonged to someone very special."
3,9,7,YANCY'S WIFE,I know what name you wanna give him Yancy. It's OK.
3,9,7,YANCY,"Really? Son, I'm naming you Philip J. Fry in honour of my little brother, who I miss every day. I love you Philip, and I always will."
3,9,7,FRY,"Here lies Philip J. Fry, named for his uncle, to carry on his spirit."
3,9,7,BENDER,"Pay dirt! I got the clover! Plus his wedding ring. Sorry ladies, I'm taken! Hey Fry you want me to smack the corpse up a little?"
3,9,7,LEELA,"Uh, Bender, I think Fry needs a moment alone."
3,9,7,BENDER,Alright grab a shovel. I'm only one skull short of a Mouseketeer reunion.
