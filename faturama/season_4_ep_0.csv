4,0,0,"""ROSWELL THAT ENDS WELL""","By J. Stewart Burns Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
4,0,0,FRY,"I've never seen a supernova blow up. But if it's anything like my old Chevy Nova, it'll light up the night sky!"
4,0,0,BENDER,"Yeah, anyone who misses this will regret it for the rest of his life! Hey Fry could you go make some popcorn?"
4,0,0,OK.,
4,0,0,FRY,"Let's go microwave, I'm in a hurry here! Hm? Hey, what smells like blue?"
4,0,1,LEELA,Fry get up here it's starting!
4,0,1,FARNSWORTH,Focus!
4,0,1,BENDER,Aw no!
4,0,1,FRY,"Hey, which crazy thing happening are you guys screaming about?"
4,0,1,ZOIDBERG,Oooh my head is spinning.
4,0,1,FRY,Ooo my popcorn's done!
4,0,2,FRY,"Aw, it's less popped than ever."
4,0,2,LEELA,I don't know what happened but we've taken on a lot of clocks. Let's get back home.
4,0,2,LEELA,Why is there so little traffic around Earth?
4,0,2,FARNSWORTH,And what's this layer of ozone? That's never been there before.
4,0,2,ZOIDBERG,Such noises!
4,0,2,LEELA,Oh no! There's no global positioning signal! Navigation is failing!
4,0,2,FRY,We're gonna crash!
4,0,2,LEELA,"Not if I can help it! Oh, I guess I can't. Everyone put on your seatbelts."
4,0,2,BENDER,Ah those things cost more lives than they save.
4,0,2,FRY,"Bender, are you OK?"
4,0,2,BENDER,I dunno. I'll try to move my feet.
4,0,2,LEELA,"Alright, here's the plan. Zoidberg, pick up the pieces. Everyone else, take five."
4,0,2,ZOIDBERG,"And Zoidberg picks up another piece, the crowd goes wild!!"
4,0,3,MAN,General in all my years of covering top secret discoveries with sheets I've never dramatically revealed anything as shocking as this. Dun-dun-dunnn! The debris from an alien spaceship!
4,0,3,GENERAL,Son I think I can safely say whoaaaa!
4,0,3,MAN,"As you can see, 1947 is going to be an eventful year for the town of...Roswell, New Mexico!"
4,0,4,FARNSWORTH,Remarkable! According the high precision digital chronograph it's July 9th 1947. Which would explain why the chronograph has turned into this pin-up calendar.
4,0,4,BENDER,Wait a second. You mean we travelled through time?
4,0,4,FARNSWORTH,Doy! Some idiot must have put metal in the microwave...
4,0,4,FRY,Yo!
4,0,4,FARNSWORTH,...and the microwave's radiation combined with the gravitons and graviolis from the supernova blasted us through Time itself.
4,0,4,LEELA,Have you seen today's news?
4,0,4,BENDER,High school gym renovations on schedule? What a load!
4,0,4,LEELA,No over here! Flying Saucer Captured!
4,0,4,BENDER,"That's no flying saucer, that's my ass!"
4,0,4,FRY,My God! This mean the flying saucer that crashed in Roswell...was...us!
4,0,4,FARNSWORTH,And the alien they captured was...was...
4,0,5,ZOIDBERG,Hello!
4,0,5,GENERAL,Eurgh!
4,0,5,ZOIDBERG,So what are you guys doing tonight? I'm up for whatever.
4,0,5,FARNSWORTH,Yes we tore the universe a new space-hole alright! But it's clenching shut fast. Our only hope of getting back to our own time is to go through it in oh say......exactly 24 hours.
4,0,5,LEELA,No problem. The ship's fixed except for the cup holder and I think I can have that operational within 10 hours.
4,0,5,FARNSWORTH,You've got 8. But a more urgent concern is the microwave. Without a working one we have no hope of returning to the future.
4,0,5,LEELA,"Well, I'm sure we can buy a microwave from somewhere around here. Meanwhile you guys sneak onto the army base and rescue Bender's body."
4,0,5,FRY,"Hey, and while we're on the base I'll visit my grandfather Enos! He was stationed at Roswell."
4,0,5,FARNSWORTH,"Your grandfather? Stay away from him you dimwitted monkey. You mustn't interfere with the past. Don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to do it. In which case. for the love of God, don't not do it!"
4,0,5,FRY,Got it.
4,0,5,FARNSWORTH,"If for example you were to kill your grandfather, you would cease to exist!"
4,0,5,FRY,But existing is basically all I do!
4,0,5,GENERAL,What is your purpose here?
4,0,5,ZOIDBERG (DROWSY),Alright officer I'll move along.
4,0,5,MAN,"What the General means is, why did you come to Earth?"
4,0,5,ZOIDBERG,Not a day goes by I don't ask myself the same question.
4,0,5,SERGEANT (SHOUTING),"Enos! Private, I want that toilet bowl so clean I could eat off it! Cos I intend to!"
4,0,5,ENOS,Well gadzooks Sarge!
4,0,5,FRY,It's him! It's my grandfather Enos.
4,0,5,SERGEANT,...Now prepare my lunch and place it in the latrine at twelve hundred hours!
4,0,5,FRY,That jeep's gonna hit him! And I won't exist anymore! Are you crazy? You almost got yourself run over!
4,0,5,ENOS,I did? Then I sure am lucky you knocked me onto this pile of rusty bayonets!
4,0,5,BENDER,Fry! Stop interfering with history! I don't wanna have to memorise a lot of new kings when I get back!
4,0,5,FRY (WHISPERING),"I had no choice. I was about to not exist. I could feel myself fading away, like Greg Kinnear."
4,0,5,ENOS,"Well, thanks soldier. I'm off to make Sarge's lunch! Handling raw chicken? It's part of the job! Mmm! Finger licking good!"
4,0,5,FRY,That's it! This place is too dangerous. We've gotta get you out of here! Everything's gonna be alright Dad!
4,0,5,ENOS,Well gadzooks I'd better ask Sarge.
4,0,5,FRY (SHOUTING),No time! Run! Run to safety!
4,0,6,MAN,"This food will determine what food, if any, the alien eats."
4,0,7,ZOIDBERG,A buffet! Oh if only I had my wallet with me.
4,0,8,MAN,"Um, it's free."
4,0,8,GENERAL,Get me the president.
4,0,8,LEELA,"Fry's from around this time, I'll talk like him."
4,0,9,LEELA,Yo homes! We're looking for a microwave oven.
4,0,9,SALESMAN,"Microwave? Never heard of that brand sweetheart. What you want is the Deuluxe Gas Princess. This baby has four broilers, a gaserrole indicator, a fold out ironing board and down here...a foot soaking tub. Since as a woman you'll be standing in front of it all day."
4,0,9,LEELA,"Oh I'm sorry, now I'll ax you again: Where can we find a mi-cro-wave?"
4,0,9,SALESMAN,Sir you're wife's hysterical. So I'll address this to you. This oven is lightning fast. It takes only 5 hours to cook a roast.
4,0,9,FARNSWORTH,Ooo that's good news! You know you really don't cook enough roast Leela! Ooo. Women!
4,0,9,FRY,Thank God I got you off that dangerour army base!
4,0,9,ENOS,"You sure are the helpful type stranger! Say, you got anything to eat in that there lunchbox? Ooo! Snack!"
4,0,9,BENDER,"Hey, that's my brain..."
4,0,9,ENOS,"Man, them crackers cut my mouth up somethin' bad! Let's stop off for a malt!"
4,0,9,ENOS,See that waitress there?
4,0,9,FRY,Yowza! I know what I want for dessert!
4,0,9,ENOS,That's my fiance! Mildred.
4,0,9,FRY,"Grandma Mildred?! Uh, no dessert, just coffee."
4,0,9,MILDRED,Okie doke. And for you snuggums?
4,0,9,ENOS,"Uh, I'll have a pie with a fried egg on top."
4,0,9,FRY,Eh she sure is pretty. You ought to marry her and father some children right away!
4,0,9,ENOS,Yeah folks say that. But did you ever get the feeling you're only going with girls cos you're supposed to?
4,0,9,FRY,What?? Don't ever say or think that again! Please. Just concentrate on staying alive! Fire! Look out! Oh! You almost got neutered.
4,0,9,ENOS,"Well, it ain't as bad as getting killed!"
4,0,9,FRY,For me it is! I'm getting you out of here!
4,0,10,FRY,
4,0,11,FRY,Safe and sound! Finally I can continue to exist!
4,0,12,3. 2. 1.,
4,0,15,BENDER,And you are outta here!
4,0,15,MILDRED,What'll you folks have today?
4,0,15,FARNSWORTH,"I'll have the soylent green, with a slice of soylent orange and some soylent coleslaw."
4,0,15,MILDRED,Pardon?
4,0,15,LEELA (WHISPERING),It's the 20th century Professor.
4,0,15,FARNSWORTH,"Oh right! I'll have a croque monsieur, the paella, two mutton pills and a stein of mead!"
4,0,15,LEELA,I'll just have a small injection of femislim.
4,0,15,MILDRED,"Uh, two chilli dogs comin' up."
4,0,15,LEELA,"Well, settle in. Without a microwave we're trapped in this time period."
4,0,15,FARNSWORTH,"Oh Lord! We'll have to endure the horrible music of the big bopper, and then the terrible tragedy of his death."
4,0,15,LEELA,Wait a second. There's a microwave radar dish at the army base. We could steal it!
4,0,15,FARNSWORTH,"No! That would alter history. Above all else, it is our sacred duty to preserve the past exactly as it was."
4,0,15,FRY,"Well, I killed my grandfather."
4,0,15,FARNSWORTH,Wha?
4,0,15,LEELA,Wait. If you killed your grandfather then why do you stll exist?
4,0,15,FRY,I dunno. Maybe God loves me.
4,0,16,MILDRED,"Killed? In an atomic blast? No sir, I'm afraid I don't take much solace in the fact that the implosion trigger functioned perfectly"
4,0,16,FRY,"Aww. There there. If it makes you feel any better, his body was vapourised so there's no chance of him coming back as a zombie."
4,0,16,MILDRED (CRYING),I'm not worried about that.
4,0,16,FRY,Then you're a braver woman than I.
4,0,16,MILDRED,You remind me of Enos. Would you mind walking me home?
4,0,16,FRY,"Uh, how far is it?"
4,0,16,GENERAL,Welcome to Roswell President Truman.
4,0,16,TRUMAN,"Fellas, this visit's top secret. No one's to know about it, except the senior officers, the scientists and a single conspiracy nutter no one will believe."
4,0,16,GENERAL,"Mr President, our men have assembled the parts of the alien ship into it's original design."
4,0,16,TRUMAN,Whistling Dixie! I want this sent to Area 51 for study.
4,0,16,GENERAL,"But sir, that's where we're building the fake moon landing set."
4,0,16,TRUMAN,Then we'll really have to land on the moon. Invent NASA and tell them to get off their fanny's!
4,0,16,TRUMAN,"If you come in peace, surrender or be destroyed. If you're here to make war, we surrender."
4,0,16,ZOIDBERG,"Both good, the important thing is I'm meeting new people."
4,0,16,TRUMAN,Bushwa! Now what's your mission? Are you planning on making some sort of alien-human hybrid?
4,0,16,ZOIDBERG,Are you coming onto me?
4,0,16,TRUMAN,Hot crackers I take exception to that!
4,0,16,ZOIDBERG (SEXFULLY),I'm not hearing a no.
4,0,16,TRUMAN,"Nuts to this space crap! If we want information, we'll have to do us an old fashioned alien autopsy!"
4,0,16,ZOIDBERG,Hooray!
4,0,16,MILDRED (CRYING),Every little thing reminds me of Enos.
4,0,16,FRY,Aww I know how you feel. My grandfather died recently.
4,0,16,MILDRED,"It's all so sad. At times like this, I just need someone to hold me. Mmm. You like holding me don't you?"
4,0,16,FRY,"Hey, you know what always cheers you up? Baking me a nice tray of sugar cookies!"
4,0,16,MILDRED,How 'bout these cookies sugar?
4,0,16,FRY,I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't even exist. But I do which proves...you can't really be my grandm -
4,0,16,LEELA [FROM OUTSIDE],Eurgh!
4,0,17,FARNSWORTH,What the hell have you done Fry?
4,0,17,FRY,Relax! She can't be my grandmother! I figured it all out.
4,0,18,MILDRED,Come back to bed deary!
4,0,18,FRY,"It's impossible! I mean, if she's my grandmother, who's my grandfather?"
4,0,18,MILDRED,Did you say something deary? I'm a bit hard of hearing.
4,0,18,DOCTOR #2,Heart.
4,0,18,ZOIDBERG,"Take, I've got four of them."
4,0,18,DOCTOR #1,Stomach contents: One deviled egg.
4,0,18,ZOIDBERG,Deviled egg?
4,0,18,DOCTOR #1,The same deviled egg.
4,0,18,LEELA,Snap out of it!
4,0,18,FARNSWORTH,Start the ship Leela. Let's just steal the damned radar dish and get back to our own time!
4,0,18,FRY,But...but won't that change history?
4,0,18,FARNSWORTH,Oh a lesson in not changing history from Mr I'm-My-Own-Grandpa! Let's get the hell out of here already! Screw history!
4,0,19,UFO! UFO!,
4,0,19,ZOIDBERG,Hey don't cut that! I need that to speak!
4,0,19,DOCTOR #2,Oh my!
4,0,19,TRUMAN,Sweet Roosevelt's ghost!
4,0,19,LEELA,Heyya! Ya! Ya!
4,0,19,FRY,"Take this Mr President, sir!"
4,0,19,ZOIDBERG,The President is gagging on my gas bladder! What an honour!
4,0,19,FARNSWORTH,Huh wha? Oh right!
4,0,20,SERGEANT (SHOUTING),Enos!
4,0,20,FRY [FROM SHIP],"He's dead, sorry."
4,0,21,FRY,Yay!
4,0,21,FARNSWORTH,Choke on that causality!
4,0,21,BENDER,1947 can kiss my shiny metal...
4,0,21,FRY,Turn around. We've gotta go back for Bender!
4,0,21,FARNSWORTH,"Impossible. The supernova timehole is closing! If we don't leave now, we'll never get back to the 31st century!"
4,0,22,FRY [FROM INSIDE],Bendeeeeer!
4,0,22,ZOIDBERG,"There, good as new!"
4,0,22,LEELA,Don't you need this one?
4,0,22,ZOIDBERG,Oh no! That's my... Gotcha!
4,0,22,FRY,"Oh, poor Bender. He must be so lonely right now. Trapped a thousand years in the past. Hey! Wait a second!"
4,0,22,LEELA,Anything?
4,0,22,FRY,No. Wait!
4,0,22,BENDER [FROM GROUND],Ow! Stupid junk!
4,0,22,FRY,He's alive! Bender. What was it like lying in that hole for a thousand years?
4,0,22,BENDER,I was enjoying it until you guys showed up.
4,0,22,FARNSWORTH,"Well, now everything is back as it was. And if history doesn't care that out degenerate friend Fry is his own grandfather, then who are we to judge?"
4,0,22,BENDER,Amen!
