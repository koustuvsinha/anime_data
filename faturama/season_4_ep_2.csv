4,2,0,"""ANTHOLOGY OF INTEREST II""","By Lewis Morton, David X. Cohen, Jason Gorbett & Scott Kirby Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
4,2,0,FARNSWORTH,"There. I've finished fine tuning my What If? machine. It can answer any What If? question, accurate to within 1/10th of a plausibility unit."
4,2,0,LEELA,That's so plausible I can't believe it!
4,2,0,FARNSWORTH,Who wants the machine to show them an alternate reality?
4,2,0,BENDER,"I wanna know what would happen if I were human. I mean, being a robot's great but we don't have emotions and sometimes that makes me very sad."
4,2,0,FARNSWORTH,"Oh lordy loo! There he goes again. Well, let's give baby what he wants. What if Bender were human?"
4,2,0,FARNSWORTH,"Good news everyone. I've discovered a way to make Bender human using a process I call ""reverse fossilisation."""
4,2,0,LEELA,How does it work?
4,2,0,FARNSWORTH,"Well, in regular fossilisation, flesh and bone turn to minerals. Realising that, it was a simple matter to reverse the process. I've already tested it by turning the toaster into a racoon."
4,2,0,FRY,Kinda gamey.
4,2,0,FARNSWORTH,Are you ready Bender?
4,2,0,BENDER,I dunno. I'm beginning to have second thoughts -
4,2,0,HERMES,Cover your shame mon!
4,2,0,FARNSWORTH,It worked! Eat it everyone who never won a Nobel Prize! And that includes you Amy!
4,2,0,BENDER,"So this is the human body huh? Neat! Hey, my antenna's gone. Nah it just moved. I'm not getting good reception on it though. Maybe if I wiggle it around a little."
4,2,0,FRY (WHISPERING),Bender no! You'll make God cry.
4,2,0,BENDER,Well lets see what kind of things thing body can do. Hey that's pretty fun. Being human is great!
4,2,0,ZOIDBERG,"Hooray, its just like Mardis Gras!"
4,2,0,BENDER,"Guy guys, you've gotta see this. You're not gonna believe it!"
4,2,0,LEELA,Bender it's OK to be pround but don;t be a show off.
4,2,0,BENDER,"Whoa, you look a lot better than you used to for some reason."
4,2,0,AMY (SEXFULLY),You're not so bad yourself big boy.
4,2,0,BENDER,Hey that felt great! Nah its not working anymore.
4,2,0,FARNSWORTH,Speak for yourself!
4,2,0,BENDER,"Whoa, this is awesome!"
4,2,0,LEELA,Bender you drank and smoked when you were a robot.
4,2,0,BENDER,But now its bad for me! Woo!
4,2,0,FRY,"Speaking of which, try these nachos."
4,2,0,BENDER,"Mmm, why didn't anyone tell me tasting things tasted so good? What's going on? That rhythm. Its doing something to my human butt."
4,2,0,AMY,"Bender, part of being human is having self control."
4,2,0,BENDER,Oh my God I bet I can eat nachos and go to the bathroom at the same time!
4,2,0,AMY,No Bender.
4,2,0,HERMES,No!
4,2,0,LEELA,Stop him.
4,2,0,BENDER,Let me go.
4,2,0,LEELA,No.
4,2,0,FARNSWORTH,"Come Bender, its time to go home and rest. I need you in top shape next week when I present you to the Nobel Prize committee. Bender?"
4,2,1,BENDER (SHOUTING),Goodbye moderation!
4,2,2,ZOIDBERG,Is Bender still missing for a week? Where is he already?
4,2,2,FARNSWORTH,"Uh as I've said before, I used reverse fossilisation, which is the reverse of regular, uh..."
4,2,2,FRY (WHISPERING),"Psst, we found him!"
4,2,2,FARNSWORTH,"Ah, them without further stalling for time, I present to the Nobel judges, the first robot ever turned into a human."
4,2,2,WERNSTRUM,"My God, he needs medical attention!"
4,2,2,ZOIDBERG,"Pulse...300, liver...failing, cholesterol...40?"
4,2,2,LEELA,Well that's not so bad.
4,2,2,ZOIDBERG,No I mean 40 pounds!
4,2,2,FARNSWORTH,"This, uh, scientific breakthrough, uh, heralds a new dawn in human-robot relations yes."
4,2,2,BENDER,"C'mere and give old Bender a kiss. Hey, you like grilled cheese?"
4,2,2,FARNSWORTH,"And, uh thats why I believe I deserve the Nobel Prize."
4,2,2,WERNSTRUM,Not only do you not deserve a Nobel Prize for loosing this bloated man-ball on the world but you are hereby kicked out of the Academy Of Science.
4,2,2,BENDER,"Wait. As men of science are not your minds open to new ideas? I say, do not judge me until you have tried my way of life for yourselves."
4,2,2,WERNSTRUM,"Young man, you have opened our minds and swayed our hearts. Let us therefore"
4,2,2,BENDER (SHOUTING),Party!
4,2,2,FARNSWORTH,Weee!
4,2,2,WERNSTRUM,"Bender, you were right! Truly you have lived more in your one week of being human than the rest of us have in our entire lives."
4,2,2,BENDER,Woo!
4,2,2,WERNSTRUM,And so to recognise your achievements I hereby award you the Nobel Prize......in uh......chemistry!
4,2,2,FARNSWORTH,Care to say a few words Bender?
4,2,2,FRY,He's dead.
4,2,2,WERNSTRUM,When did he die?
4,2,2,FARNSWORTH,About 12 hours ago when the party started.
4,2,2,WERNSTRUM,"But he just said ""Woo."""
4,2,2,FARNSWORTH,No. That was air escaping from the folds of his fat. Goodnight sweet prince. You were the greatest man any of us will ever know. Well lets get him out of here. He's starting to smell up the joint.
4,2,2,NARRATOR,"You watched it, you can't unwatch it. Stay tuned for more Tales Of Interest!"
4,2,2,FARNSWORTH,Who else has a question for the What If? machine? Scruffy? Katrina? Xanfor?
4,2,2,FRY,Ooo I have one. I'm good at video games and bad at everything else. That's why I wish life were more like a video game.
4,2,2,FARNSWORTH,Can you put that in the form of a question?
4,2,2,FRY,"Uh, What if that thing I said?"
4,2,2,FARNSWORTH,Oh great machine we beseech thee. What if life were more like a video game?
4,2,3,NIXON [ON TV],Good evening ignorant pigs. Put down your crack pipes and you beer bongs and pay attention as I sign a historic peace accord with Ambassador Kong of planet Nintendu 64.
4,2,3,FRY,"Wait a second, I know that monkey. His name is Donkey."
4,2,3,FARNSWORTH,Monkies aren't donkies! Quit messing with my head!
4,2,4,NIXON,I'll just put the old John Q. Nixon on it. There. No major crap ups. You're on Mr Ambassador! What the?
4,2,6,MARIO,Mama Mia! The cruel meatball of war has rolled onto our laps and ruined our white pants of peace!
4,2,6,MAN,Mr Fry rumour has it you know the secrets of the video game Chance. Please step into the war room.
4,2,7,MAN,You'll be meeting with General Colin Pac-man.
4,2,7,PAC-MAN,Wakka wakka wakka wakka. Lets get down to business. What can you tell us about the Nintendians?
4,2,7,FRY,"Well sir, I spent all of ninth grade studying them. Except for that day when my eyeballs started to bleed. And in my opinion."
4,2,7,PAC-MAN,"Quickly, to the escape tunnels!"
4,2,8,PAC-MAN,This way damn it!
4,2,8,ZOIDBERG,"Mmm, delicious! Just like stale marshmellows! Ooo and a cherry!"
4,2,8,FRY,Hey watch out!
4,2,8,ZOIDBERG,Uh oh!
4,2,8,LEELA,"Oh my god, he ate Fry! Fry is dead!"
4,2,8,FRY,"Its OK, I had another guy!"
4,2,8,PAC-MAN,Wakka...wakka wa...
4,2,8,LEELA,Invaders! Possibly from space!
4,2,9,LRRR,"People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the planet Nintendu 64. Tremble in fear at our three different kinds of ships!"
4,2,10,FRY,"Alright, its Saturday night. I have no date, a two litre bottle of Shasta, and my all Rush mix tape! Let's rock!"
4,2,11,ND-ND,We're losing ships sir. What are your orders?
4,2,11,LRRR,"Increase speed, drop down and reverse direction!"
4,2,12,FRY,I've still got a trick or two up my sleeve. Watch as I fire up through our own shields.
4,2,12,BENDER,He's a madman! A madman!!
4,2,12,PAC-MAN,It's working. Victory is ensured! My retirement tomorrow will be all the sweeter! I'm hit! So cold!
4,2,12,MS PAC-MAN (CRYING),No - wakka wakka!
4,2,12,FRY,"Amy, tend to the widow pac-man."
4,2,13,LRRR,Drop down and increase speed.
4,2,14,ZOIDBERG,One ship is left only.
4,2,15,LEELA,Come on Fry get it!
4,2,15,FRY [SWEATING],It's moving too fast. Oh I could never get the last one. My brother always got it for me!
4,2,16,LRRR,"Drop down, reverse direction, prepare for landing."
4,2,16,LRRR,You are defeated. Instead of shooting where I was you should have shot where I was going to be.
4,2,16,BESERK,All your base are belong to us.
4,2,16,FRY,What do you monsters want?
4,2,16,DONKEY KONG,One thing and one thing only. Quarters! A million allowances worth of quarters! No slugs or tokens!
4,2,16,BESERK,Fork 'em over! Fork 'em over!
4,2,16,FARNSWORTH,Forget it you pixelated pirates. We need those quarters to do our laundry.
4,2,16,AMY,Yeah!
4,2,16,BENDER,Right on!
4,2,16,LEELA,Sure thing Professor!
4,2,16,LRRR,"But, but space invaders need to do laundry too! I mean look at Donkey Kong here. Have you smelled his loincloth lately?"
4,2,16,ZOIDBERG,Yes.
4,2,16,AMY,Go away. We're not giving you our quarters no matter what.
4,2,16,LRRR,Well...then what if we throw our laundry in with yours? Would that be acceptable?
4,2,16,FRY,I guess so.
4,2,16,LRRR,
4,2,16,NARRATOR,Bravo! That'll be hard to top! I pity the next Tale Of Interest!
4,2,16,FARNSWORTH,"Well, there's time for one last question. Let's turn to the Who Ask machine to see who's next."
4,2,16,WHO ASK MACHINE,Um uh um...Amy. I mean Leela.
4,2,16,LEELA,
4,2,16,BENDER,Boo hoo.
4,2,16,FRY,Ow!
4,2,16,BENDER,Uh...where?
4,2,16,LEELA,So my question is this: What if I found my true home? Ow!
4,2,17,LEELA,Where are we?
4,2,17,LEELA,"Nibbler, I don't think we're in New New York anymore. Jeez, apparently the phrase tone it down doesn't exist on this planet. Oh no! We hit someone! Quick, back into the ships. Ooo, nice boots!"
4,2,17,CUBERT,Look everyone! She killed the man-witch of the west!
4,2,17,LEELA,A witch? That explains how these boots magically appeared on my feet.
4,2,17,GLURMO,"No, you stole them, we saw you."
4,2,17,LEELA,"Well...its hard to find shoes that fit me. So anyway, who are you people? Haven't I seen you in some copyrighted movie?"
4,2,17,GLURMO (SINGING),"We resemble but are legally distinct from the lollipop guild, the lollipop"
4,2,17,AMY,"Greetings Leela, I'm The Cute With Of The North!"
4,2,17,LEELA,"Yeah, can anyone fix my ship so I can get home?"
4,2,17,AMY,Abracaduh! Just ask the Professor! He lives in the Emerald Laboratory down Martin Luther King Boulevard.
4,2,17,LEELA,You mean that yellow brick road?
4,2,17,AMY,The city council renamed it in 1975. Ooo those are great shoes!
4,2,17,LEELA,Oh thank you.
4,2,17,AMY,Do they come in women's sizes?
4,2,17,FRY,
4,2,17,LEELA,"Wow, a talking scarecrow. Wanna come with us to see the Professor? He might be able to give you a brain."
4,2,17,FRY,"Hey, that's not a nice thing to say."
4,2,17,BENDER,Beer. Beer.
4,2,17,LEELA,Whiskey OK?
4,2,17,BENDER,Now did you say you were off to see the Professor? 'Cause I could use a heart. A human heart. I need to pump a lot of blood out of my basement.
4,2,17,ZOIDBERG,And I'm the other guy. Courage. Not enough of it. Need some from whatshisname.
4,2,18,MOM,Damn this DSL! Fly my stupids! Fly out and get them!
4,2,18,IGNER,"But Mom, you promised you'd make monkey cake today."
4,2,18,MOM,"By ""monkey cake"" I meant your ass."
4,2,19,FRY,"Man, we've been skipping for hours. I need to pull over and take the wiz."
4,2,19,ZOIDBERG,What do I smell or something? Oh!
4,2,19,LEELA,Why did you bring us here?
4,2,19,ZOIDBERG,And why did I have to take a cab?
4,2,19,MOM,I'll tell you why I brought you here you twice baked barf bag. Because I've always wanted a daughter to love. You want to get adopted you little skank?
4,2,19,LEELA,"And live here? And be a witch like you? Yeah, alright. As long as I get to hurt people and not just dance around at the equinox."
4,2,19,MOM,Absolutely.
4,2,19,LEELA,"Oh mommy, I found my true home!"
4,2,19,BENDER,Hooray!
4,2,19,ZOIDBERG,All right!
4,2,19,FRY,That's great Leela.
4,2,19,BENDER,I've heard worse excuses to drink. Oops.
4,2,19,MOM,I'm melting! Who would have thought a small amount of liquid would ever fall on me?
4,2,19,BENDER,"Well, no point in letting her go to waste."
4,2,19,HERMES [FROM INSIDE],Yes?
4,2,19,LEELA,We're here to see the Professor.
4,2,19,HERMES [FROM INSIDE],No one sees the mighty Professor.
4,2,19,LEELA,Oh for the love of Benji.
4,2,20,FARNSWORTH,I am the Professor. Great and...uh...forgetful! Now what do you nice kids want?
4,2,20,ZOIDBERG,"Nothing, I'm leaving. But if you have extra courage I'd haul it away for you maybe?"
4,2,20,FARNSWORTH,"Oh blithery poop my cowardly lobster! You don't need courage. Afterall, who needs courage when you have a gun?"
4,2,20,ZOIDBERG,"Now world, you put your hands up!"
4,2,20,FARNSWORTH,"And you lad, all you need is brain."
4,2,20,FRY,Why does everyone keep saying that?
4,2,20,BENDER,This is a stick up. Give me the bag old man!
4,2,20,FARNSWORTH,Here you go my friend. 5000 Professor Land fun bucks!
4,2,20,BENDER,Oh crap.
4,2,20,FARNSWORTH,"As for you young lady, you want to go home right?"
4,2,20,LEELA,No not anymore. I wanna stay here and become the new Wicked Witch.
4,2,20,FARNSWORTH,"Nonsense. Now click your big honking boots together three times and wish to go home to Kansas, to live in poerty with your dirt farming, teetotalling aunt and uncle."
4,2,20,LEELA,"Uh, alright. Here I go. There's no place like - I wanna be a witch! Oh no, help, what's happening?"
4,2,20,ZOIDBERG,"Uh sorry, I think there's a problem with your upstairs toilet."
4,2,21,BENDER,Wake up!
4,2,21,FRY,"Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head."
4,2,21,LEELA,I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there and you were there and you were there.
4,2,21,FRY,"Never mind Professor, she came to."
4,2,21,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, so close."
4,2,21,HERMES,"There's always next year Professor, there's always next year."
