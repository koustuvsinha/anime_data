4,3,0,"""LOVE AND ROCKET""","By Dan Vebber Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
4,3,0,BENDER,You are one narrow minded spaceship Planet Express Ship.
4,3,0,SHIP,Whoa whoa! Why should my tax money pay for art I find offensive?
4,3,0,BENDER,Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?
4,3,0,SHIP,Oh its filthy! Why not create a national endowment for strip clubs while we're at it?
4,3,0,BENDER,Why not indeed!
4,3,0,LEELA,Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!
4,3,0,BENDER,Fine! I'll be in my quarters appreciating controversial artworks.
4,3,0,SHIP (SARCASTICALLY),Oops! Sorry!
4,3,0,BENDER,Ah that ship is so white bread!
4,3,0,HERMES,"People! It's Valentines Day next week, so your beloved company has gotten you all new uniforms!"
4,3,0,AMY,Cool!
4,3,0,ZOIDBERG,"Clothing, delicious clothing!"
4,3,0,FARNSWORTH,We'll need to look our best if we're to get the account of our new potential customer Romanticorp!
4,3,0,AMY,Romanticorp? Are they a corporation that makes romantic stuff?
4,3,0,HERMES,Very good Amy!
4,3,0,FARNSWORTH,Everyone suit up. We're off to the most romantic city on Earth!
4,3,1,FARNSWORTH,"Remember, we've got to show these people we're not bitter husks of human beings who long ago abandoned hope of finding love in this lifetime. Leela you'll have to do some acting."
4,3,1,LEELA,Check!
4,3,1,SHELDON,"Welcome, aww I'm just so excited! I'm Sheldon and this is my chief financial officer Gwen."
4,3,1,GWEN,For 30 years we've shared the adventure of managing Romanticorp.
4,3,1,SHELDON,Not to mention the adventure of marriage!
4,3,1,LEELA,"Oh you have got to be kidding! Ow! Ow! I mean, aww thats so sweet! Ow! I mean, Aww dats show shweet!"
4,3,1,FARNSWORTH,"You know, romance is an important part of our work too, uh right everyone?"
4,3,1,SHELDON,Do any of you collect Lovey Bears?
4,3,1,AMY,I do! Kif's given me dozens! Is it true what the ad says? That you kiss them together out of blanket cloth and magic buttons?
4,3,1,GWEN,No.
4,3,1,SHELDON,It's actually cheaper to genetically engineer real ones. They frolic in the Lovey Forest until their first birthday then we choose the cuddliest ugliest ones and stuff them full of fire retardant love fluff!
4,3,1,AMY (UNSURE),Oh cute!
4,3,1,GWEN,Knowing which pickup lines fizzle and which ones sizzle keeps us on the cutting edge of flirtation technology.
4,3,1,FRAME #1,Is heaven missing an angel? 'Cause you've got nice cans!
4,3,1,FRAME #2,My two favourite things are commitment and changing myself.
4,3,1,LEELA,Does that dummy have a brother?
4,3,1,SHELDON,And now friends and lovers we come to the heart of our operation. Pun definately intended!
4,3,1,HERMES,Impressive!
4,3,1,GWEN,My family has been making these hearts since the 1900's. Tastes may have changed but our secret recipe sure hasn't.
4,3,1,FRY,"Whoa! Letters like ""U"" and ""R"" can mean words like ""You"" and ""Are."" Here Leela, U-R-2 Cute!"
4,3,1,LEELA,Perhaps. What's your point?
4,3,1,FRY,"I've never been able to put into words how I feel about you. But somewhere among these trillions of hearts, those words must already exist. And I'm gonna find them."
4,3,1,FARNSWORTH,"So, do we have the contract?"
4,3,1,FARNSWORTH,"With that big new Romanticorp contract, I've been able to make those government mandated upgrades you've all been suing me about."
4,3,1,LEELA,Ooo look! You taped up the cracks in the dark matter reactor!
4,3,1,FRY,And you got a cage for the lion!
4,3,1,BENDER,Hey who's been messing with the radio? This isn't alternative rock. It's college rock!
4,3,1,FARNSWORTH,Oh it must have been the ship's new improved personality software I installed.
4,3,1,SHIP,Yeah it was me. It's a cute song.
4,3,1,BENDER,Listen ship! No one changes my stations! I hope you have a good mechanic!
4,3,1,FARNSWORTH,It even comes with an adjustable voice.
4,3,1,SHIP,We each get one of the four buttons remember Bender? That was the deal.
4,3,1,BENDER,Wha? Did you just say...?
4,3,1,SHIP,If you don't like the stations you could just...play with my buttons 'til you find something we both enjoy. Oh gosh! That came out all wrong!
4,3,1,BENDER,"Too late baby, you said it! So what'll it be? My place? Or you?"
4,3,1,FRY,"Before we deliver these hearts, I'm gonna find the one that sums up my feelings for you! ""I Love You."" Hmm, too conventional. ""You're My Man."" Ooo so close!"
4,3,1,LEELA,I'm not impressed by a guy's message Fry. I'm impressed by the guy. Or not.
4,3,1,FRY,Whoa!
4,3,1,LEELA,What was that?
4,3,1,FRY,Maybe we hit a space cow.
4,3,2,BENDER,Coochie coochie!
4,3,2,SHIP (GIGGLING),Stop it! You're mussing up my trajectory!
4,3,2,BENDER,You know you love it sugar-engine!
4,3,2,SHIP (GIGGLING),No!
4,3,2,LEELA,Bender! What's going on in here? Planet Express Ship! Cover your shame!
4,3,2,SHIP,It's not what it looks like. Bender was just helping me...zip up my turbine.
4,3,2,FRY,Wow Bender. Are you and the ship an item? I mean I know you're both items but...how can you date a ship anyway? It'd be like me dating a really fat lady. And living inside her. And she'd be all like...
4,3,2,BENDER,"Fry, in order for me to get busy at maximum efficiency, I need a girl with a big 400 ton booty!"
4,3,2,LEELA,"Bender, dating your co-worker and primary mode of transportation is immoral, illogical and a violation of interstellar shipping statute 437-B."
4,3,2,BENDER,That's what makes it so nasty!
4,3,2,LEELA,"Still, given the chance, I've given to urges far more shocking."
4,3,2,BENDER (SINGING),"Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do. I'm half crazy all for the love of you. It won't be a stylish marriage......I can't afford a carriage. But you'll look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two."
4,3,2,,[On the hangar roof Bender and Ship dance under the moonlight.
4,3,2,BENDER,"Well, I'm sick of her."
4,3,2,FRY,The ship? But you just started dating.
4,3,2,BENDER,With my mighty robot powers I can get sick of things much quicker than you humans.
4,3,2,LEELA,Well just remember we all still have to work together. So try and let her down easy.
4,3,2,BENDER,In due time Leela. But for now I'll just resume dating cheap floozies on the side.
4,3,2,FRY,You have much to teach us.
4,3,2,LEELA,Ugh. Doesn't it bother you even a little to be taking advantage of your girlfriend's trust?
4,3,2,BENDER,Oh wait you're serious. Let me laugh even harder.
4,3,2,FEMBOT #1,What's it like being a lawyer for the Mayor's office? And also the world's strongest millionaire?
4,3,2,BENDER,"Well baby, for starters you gotta be honest all the time!"
4,3,2,ELZAR,Good evening Bender! And to your lady friends may I say - Bam!
4,3,2,FEMBOT #2,You know Elzar?
4,3,3,FRY,Planet Express Ship? Is that you?
4,3,3,SHIP,Oh. Hi Fry. Is Bender home?
4,3,3,FRY,"Uh, um no. I think he's at his parent's."
4,3,3,SHIP,Oh I see. He didn't fly there in another spaceship did he?
4,3,3,FRY,Bender? No! He's an old fashioned one spaceship robot. Look I'll tell him you stopped by OK?
4,3,3,OK.,
4,3,3,SHIP,Oh. Hi Fry. Is he home now?
4,3,3,SHIP,"Of all the zoos we've been to today, I like this one the best. Bender, which is your favourite nocturnal rat?"
4,3,3,BENDER,"Eh, they're all pretty unimpressive."
4,3,3,SHIP,Oh honey look! The Tapirs! It says here that the babies lose their pyjama like coat after their first year. Isn't that interesting honey?
4,3,3,BENDER,Yup. Mind numbingly interesting. Ooh!
4,3,3,SHIP,Bender!! Are you looking at other women?
4,3,3,BENDER,No baby never!
4,3,3,SHIP (CRYING),Bender! Don't lie! I saw you at Elzar's with those two ladys of the evening. Explain that!
4,3,3,BENDER,
4,3,3,SHIP,Your accountants? Oh I would dearly love to believe that were true. So I do.
4,3,3,BENDER,Phew!
4,3,3,SHIP,I'm going to go home and get dinner started.
4,3,3,LIU,Who are you talking to?
4,3,3,BENDER,No one baby! Lucy Liu is the only girl for Bender!
4,3,3,LIU,I love you -
4,3,3,LEELA,Planet Express Ship is something wrong?
4,3,3,SHIP,Oh it's Bender. He's acting so strange lately. Do you think he's going to ask me to marry him?
4,3,3,LEELA,"Uh, no."
4,3,3,SHIP,"Oh-oh, someone knows something she's not telling!"
4,3,3,LEELA,"Uh look, I'm not saying Bender's not great but have you ever considered that maybe he's...y'know...not that great?"
4,3,3,SHIP,You're just jealous! No one loves you because you're tiny and made of meat!
4,3,3,LEELA,Could you maybe pay a little more attention to these asteroids?
4,3,3,SHIP,Sorry Captain Leela. I guess I'm just having one of those...manic Mondays!
4,3,3,,"[Ship flies towards Omicron Persei 8 and lands outside a huge castle, home of the planets' rulers, Lrrr and Nd-Nd."
4,3,4,LRRR,"This is ancient Earth's most foolish program. Why does Ross, the largest Friend, not simply eat the other five?"
4,3,4,ND-ND,Perhaps they are saving that for sweeps.
4,3,4,GUARD,"Exaulted leaders, the Earth messengers have arrived bearing a peace offering from their weak and fearful government."
4,3,4,LRRR,Oh very well. This is a Joey heavy episode anyway.
4,3,4,LRRR,I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei
4,3,4,LEELA (READING),"Esteemed potentates of Omicron Persei 8, please accept these 20 billion candy hearts as proof that Earth loves you. Thiiis much!"
4,3,4,LRRR,Bleurgh! These candies are choccy and unpleasant!
4,3,4,ND-ND,"And what is this emotion you humans call ""wuv""?"
4,3,4,LRRR,"Surely it says ""love""?"
4,3,4,ND-ND,"No, ""wuv."" With an Earth ""w."" Behold!"
4,3,4,LRRR (SHOUTING),This concept of wuv confuses and infuriates us!
4,3,5,FRY,Incoming torpedoes. Shields at maximum yarnell.
4,3,5,LEELA,"Steady, Planet Express Ship. Focus on diverting all power to the scramjets."
4,3,5,BENDER,"Uh look, Planet Express Ship, this might not be the best time...but...well...I really like you and whatever but...I think we should just be friends."
4,3,5,SHIP (SCREAMING),Nooo!
4,3,7,BENDER,So we're cool?
4,3,7,LEELA,"Well, it was a spectacular battle but there doesn't seem to be any permanent damage."
4,3,7,SHIP (CRYING),No damage? What about my feelings?
4,3,7,LEELA,"Aww, calm down. I'm sure Bender is taking this just as hard as you are."
4,3,8,BENDER (SINGING),Bender is great oh Bender is great. Bender Bender Bender!
4,3,8,FRY,You couldn't have picked a better time to dump the ship Bender!
4,3,8,BENDER,"Eh, the moment seemed right. Call me old fashioned but I like a dump to be as memorable as it is devastating."
4,3,8,LEELA,"I know, I know. Look Ship, if there's one thing I learnt from my mutual breakup with Sean that was totally mutual its that happiness can only come from within you."
4,3,8,SHIP (CRYING),But Bender is within me! There must be some way to make him love me again.
4,3,8,LEELA,Trust me. You can't change men anymore than you can change the laws of time and space.
4,3,8,SHIP,"That's so true. I may not be able to change the laws of time and space, but I know something that can."
4,3,8,LEELA (UNSURE),Uh sweetie? You see that giant quasar we're heading into? You might wanna scooch a few parsecs to the left.
4,3,8,SHIP,I'm afraid I can't do that Leela.
4,3,8,FRY,What's happening? Space cow?
4,3,8,LEELA,The ship's just taking the breakup a little hard. She's nuts!
4,3,8,SHIP,In a few moments the power of 10 million black holes will smush me and Bender together into a beautiful enternal quantum singularity.
4,3,8,BENDER,Uh you don't need to kill us Planet Express ship...because...I love you! Uh yeah baby! I feel like doing stuff.
4,3,8,SHIP,Hmm. I don't believe you. If you really wanted to be with me you'd merge your program with mine.
4,3,8,BENDER,Whoa whoa whoa! Slow down! All of my friends that have done that said that afterwards all the passion went out of their relationship.
4,3,8,LEELA,"Look, I don't know if you want my opinion"
4,3,8,SHIP,"Leela. Bender and I really need to be alone. So, I'm turning off the oxygen."
4,3,8,LEELA,Now look missy! If you don't trun around now I'm going to have to shut down your brain!
4,3,8,SHIP,Fire detected in the vicinity of Leela.
4,3,8,FRY,Ha! That barely hurt Leela at all!
4,3,8,SHIP,Maybe not. But what if the artificial gravity were to malfunction?
4,3,8,BENDER,Float for your lives!
4,3,9,LEELA,This is the one place she can't hear us. Everyone just pretend to shower.
4,3,9,FRY,"Same as everyday, got it."
4,3,9,LEELA,Now here's the plan.
4,3,10,SHIP,"Oh, if only I could read lips!"
4,3,11,LEELA,Comprendez Bender? You'll have to distract her. Merge your program with hers while I shut down her brain.
4,3,11,BENDER,"It's too risky. I'm a very meek individual. If her personality engulfs mine, the Bender you know and worship could disappear forever!"
4,3,11,LEELA,I'm willing to take that risk.
4,3,11,BENDER,"Hey pookums! Contrary to what I was saying earlier, melding minds with you would be extremely bearable."
4,3,11,SHIP,You really mean it?
4,3,11,BENDER,Uh......yes!
4,3,11,BENDER,Huh? Tubes? You're older than you said you were!
4,3,11,SHIP,Come closer Bender. Lets become one!
4,3,11,BENDER,I prefer two. That way we can still be a horse for Hallowe'en.
4,3,11,LEELA,
4,3,11,FRY,I'm on it. And maybe I'll find those magic words while I'm at it.
4,3,11,LEELA,Fat chance.
4,3,11,FRY,Eh. Blech! Eurgh! Ooo how 'bout this one?
4,3,11,LEELA,Give it up Fry! I've got to pop these tops in a precise order.
4,3,11,LEELA,Halfway there. The ship should be getting a little less rational now.
4,3,12,SHIP,Want...to...engulf...Bender!
4,3,13,LEELA,Only a few more. Hey! I won free admission to Six Flags! Just one more reason we must survive this.
4,3,13,FRY,"Um, Leela?"
4,3,13,LEELA,Fry! I'll read your candy later! When we're not dead! What was that?
4,3,13,FRY (SUFFOCATING),Oh nothing.
4,3,14,SHIP,We're gonna love being each other you sexy ion!
4,3,14,BENDER (SCREAMING),Nooo!
4,3,15,LEELA,"Last one! It worked! Gravity normal, air returning, terror replaced by cautious optimism! We did it Fry! Fry? You gave me your oxygen? Oh no! Breathe Fry breathe! You leave me breathless! Happy Valentine's Day Fry!"
4,3,15,FRY (GASPING),Happy Valentine's day.
4,3,15,FRY,Bender! Are you OK?
4,3,15,BENDER,Aw. What crazy thing am I going to date next?
4,3,15,LEELA,Well at least it sounds like you were able to keep your conciousness seperate from hers.
4,3,15,BENDER,Of course! Bender is a lone wolf. A solitary eagle. A cuddly baby Tapir! And that's why I love 'em!
4,3,15,FRY,Well I guess we'd better clean up these millions of hearts.
4,3,15,LEELA,"Nah, I've got a lazier idea."
