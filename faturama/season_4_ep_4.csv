4,4,0,"""LEELA'S HOMEWORLD""","By Kristen Gore Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
4,4,0,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, everyone! You all know the orphanarium where Leela grew up?"
4,4,0,FRY,Sure. We talk about it all the time.
4,4,0,LEELA,Really?
4,4,0,FRY,No. Burn!
4,4,0,FARNSWORTH,"Well done, fellows! Anyway, said orphanarium has named Leela orphan of the year."
4,4,0,AMY,Yee-ha!
4,4,0,BENDER,All right!
4,4,0,AMY,Your parents must be so proud. Oops! Sorry.
4,4,0,FARNSWORTH,And the good news keeps on coming. Behold my latest invention.
4,4,0,BENDER,Neat.
4,4,0,FARNSWORTH,Ta-da! It's a glow-in-the-dark nose you can wear over your regular non-glowing nose. Observe.
4,4,0,AMY,"Whoa, clool!"
4,4,0,BENDER,Now I can punch you in the nose in the dark.
4,4,0,BENDER,Where'd it go?
4,4,0,AMY,"Hey, Professor what's all this scloop, glorking out of the machine?"
4,4,0,FARNSWORTH,"That? It's uh...nothing. Yes, nothing. If you think it's anything you're a suspicous moron."
4,4,0,HERMES,It looks like toxic waste. And it smells like toxic waste.
4,4,0,FRY,What does it taste like?
4,4,0,HERMES,"Delicious fig pudding! Ooh, that's good! But a distinct aftertaste of toxic waste."
4,4,0,FARNSWORTH,"Alright, alright so the machine produces a few toxic by-products! You don't have to make a federal case out of it."
4,4,0,HERMES,"I'm afraid I do. I order you dispose of that toxic waste properly, or bribe me. Either way it'll cost $500."
4,4,0,BENDER,"500 real dollars? That's an outrage! Professor, I'll take care of that waste for $499 and 100 cents."
4,4,0,FARNSWORTH,"Hmm, I know that's a rip but I'll pay for the convenience. Do you take credit cards?"
4,4,0,BENDER,Let's find out.
4,4,0,BENDER,"Alright, environment, you've met your match!"
4,4,1,SMITTY,"Hey, get back in the sewer, weirdy. No mutants on the surface."
4,4,1,VYOLET,But he ruined my wedding dress.
4,4,2,BENDER,"Honey, that thing was ruined the minute it went on you. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout."
4,4,2,VOGEL,"Y'know, it's not easy being an orphan, not if I have anything to do with it. But today's honouree, Turanga Leela, has really made something of herself . I'll never forget the night that cute little alien baby was abandoned on our doorstep. Because I have a photographic memory and I remember every night!"
4,4,2,VOGEL,"What the...? An alien language? I guess you're an alien. What a beautiful gigantic eye you ha -- Well, come on in."
4,4,3,VOGEL,"From those humble beginnings Leela went on to become a county-certified starship captain. And so it is my pleasure today, to nail her picture alongside those of our most distinguished alumini."
4,4,3,LEELA,Thank you very much. Like many of you I never knew my parents...
4,4,3,VOGEL,Give me a -- argh!
4,4,3,LEELA,
4,4,3,VOGEL,Picture's up.
4,4,3,BENDER,It's crooked!
4,4,3,LEELA,"...In the end though, it doesn't matter who my parents were. All that matters is what I learned here, within these unscalable walls, that I have strength to make it on my own, just like all of you kids here today."
4,4,3,KIDS,Leela! Leela! Leela!
4,4,3,NINA,Look at me! I'm Leela!
4,4,3,ALBERT,"Nuh uh, 'cause I'm double Leela!"
4,4,3,VOGEL,"That's it, Albert, no more espresso for you."
4,4,3,PHOTOGRAPHER,"Mind if I get a picture of you with your picture for the news, ma'am?"
4,4,3,LEELA,Yes! I mean no! Just make sure you get my nonchalant side!
4,4,3,GUY,Wooo!
4,4,4,FRY,"If those aren't tears of happiness, please stop crying."
4,4,4,LEELA,"It's OK, Fry, I'm fine. I won an award today."
4,4,4,FRY,"Is it this room that's making you sad? It's probably the room. Come on, lets go for a walk."
4,4,4,LEELA,"I'm sorry you saw that, Fry. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness."
4,4,4,FRY,"Yeah, I do that with my stupidness."
4,4,4,LEELA,"I told a whole crowd today that being an orphan made me strong. But all I really wanted was a mom and dad, to hold me and stroke my hair and tell me they loved me."
4,4,4,FRY,"Then today's your lucky day because I happen to be a holding, stroking, lovin' machine! Also spankin'!"
4,4,4,LEELA,That's not even close to what I had in mind.
4,4,4,FRY,"Well, anyway, just remember that people care about you."
4,4,4,LEELA,"I know. Sometimes when I'm lonely, I look up at the sky and I get this feeling that somewhere, on some unknown planet, circling a distant star, my parents are up there, looking down on me."
4,4,4,FRY,"Yo yo, Bezender! What up?"
4,4,4,BENDER,My dumping business is booming. I just got hired to clean up the set of Free Willy 3.
4,4,4,LEELA,"Bender! Cut it out! First of all the sewer mutants will be mad. Second, everything else that's horribly wrong with what you're doing!"
4,4,4,BENDER,"Ah, those stupid mutants can't do anything. You seem to be forgetting one simple fact, namely, I'm up here and they are safely down --"
4,4,4,BENDER,What did I do to deserve this?
4,4,4,DWAYNE,"Behold, our once beautiful mutigenic sewage lake."
4,4,4,VYOLET,The radioactive waste you dumped in it has made it brighten up to see how ugly we really are.
4,4,4,DWAYNE,"Oh, man!"
4,4,4,RAOUL,As if our lives weren't miserable enough already!
4,4,4,LEG MUTANT,Tell me about it!
4,4,4,RAOUL,Let the punishment commence!
4,4,4,LEELA,Punishment?
4,4,4,FRY,No fair!
4,4,4,BENDER,Bender's innocent!
4,4,4,RAOUL,"The instant you touch these mutatious waters your DNA will be forever altered, turning you into horrible mutants like us. Especially him! Allow me to demonstrate!"
4,4,4,FRY,It's like that time I peeked in the kitchen at Imperial Hunan.
4,4,4,RAOUL,Submerge the prisoners.
4,4,4,BENDER,Wait. I don't even have DNA. Why am I screaming?
4,4,4,DWAYNE,We're gonna beat you afterwards.
4,4,4,MUTANTS,Mutate! Mutate! Mutate! ...
4,4,4,HOODED FIGURE #1,Turanga Leela!
4,4,4,LEELA,Who said that? How do you know my real name?
4,4,4,BENDER,Whee!
4,4,4,RAOUL,What are you doing? Stop it.
4,4,4,FRY,What happened?
4,4,4,LEELA,I don't know. I think I saved us somehow.
4,4,4,RAOUL,Go after them! The waters can't mutate us mutants!
4,4,5,RAOUL,They went this way!
4,4,5,BENDER,Quick! In there!
4,4,5,DWAYNE,Kill! Kill! Kill!
4,4,6,LEELA,Great chichi's ghost!
4,4,6,BENDER,What's this junk?
4,4,6,LEELA,It looks like...a timeline of my whole life.
4,4,6,FRY,That's when we saved Earth from a giant asteroid of garbage.
4,4,6,LEELA,And here's when I dropped out and bummed around India for a while.
4,4,6,BENDER,And this is just last year at Space Mardi Gras.
4,4,6,LEELA,Its like some kind of weird Leela museum...and I'm the Leela!
4,4,6,FRY,Dude! Over here!
4,4,6,LEELA,It's all the best stuff I ever flushed down the toilet! Those are some of my diary pages. And my screenplay!
4,4,6,FRY,And also - for some reason - the letter I wrote you full of my personal feelings.
4,4,6,LEELA,"Oh, I'm scared! My whole life has just been a show for some perverted mutant!"
4,4,6,VYOLET,They must be in here.
4,4,6,RAOUL,"Yeah, after them."
4,4,6,BENDER,And then Bender ran!
4,4,6,FRY,"Leela, freak out later. We're not done escaping yet!"
4,4,6,DWAYNE,Got ya!
4,4,6,LEG MUTANT,Take this!
4,4,6,FRY,Ow!
4,4,6,RAOUL,This time I'm calling for the death penalty. And not just because I'm running for re-election as Supreme Mutant.
4,4,6,MUTANTS,Four more years! Four more years!
4,4,6,RAOUL,"Oh, very well. Your attention. Instead of being tortured to death, the prisoners shall hereby be expelled from the sewers and never allowed to return."
4,4,6,BENDER,Oh cruel fate! Can we really never return to this dank pit of sewage?!
4,4,6,LEELA,Wait a minute. Why aren't you gonna kill us anymore?
4,4,6,BENDER,Yeah! What are you chicken? Buk buk buk bukuk!
4,4,6,FRY,"Shut up, you two! We can kill ourselves when we get home!"
4,4,6,RAOUL,They'll need transportation to the surface. Bring in the airship.
4,4,6,BENDER,Eww!
4,4,6,RAOUL,"We constructed it from the remnants of old discarded Macy's parade balloons: Underdog's groin, Bart Simpsons's left ear and right shin, Garfield's owner Jon's forehead."
4,4,6,MUTANT,Fire up the sewer gas!
4,4,6,TRICLOPS,Move it ya ugly normals!
4,4,6,BENDER,"Uh, I'm gettin' dizzy! I can't walk straight!"
4,4,6,FRY,Come on Leela. You can do it!
4,4,6,BENDER,Hurry! We're missing our bus!
4,4,6,FRY,Whoa! What are you doing?
4,4,6,BENDER,I'm gettin' on the bus!
4,4,6,LEELA,Don't worry! I'll be fine! They know something about me and I've got to find out what. The lake didn't mutate me. What is going on here?!
4,4,6,OCTOPUS,It worked for me. I used to be a little blonde girl named Virginia.
4,4,6,LEELA,Eurgh! Who the hell are you?
4,4,6,HOODED FIGURE #1,No one. And watch your language young lady!
4,4,6,TRICLOPS,Stop right there! I don't want to hurt you. I didn't want you to hurt me either.
4,4,6,FRY,Leela's going nuts and I can't save her unless I learn more about her mysterious past. Isn't there anything else you can tell me?
4,4,6,VOGEL,Nah. Nothing that wouldn't be a waste of your time.
4,4,6,FRY,That's impossible because my time is worthless!
4,4,6,VOGEL,"Huh. Well then there is one thing. It's the note I found with Leela the day she was abandoned. But it's written in Alienese, so no-one on Earth can translate it. Not even Brainzilla."
4,4,6,FRY,Hand it over.
4,4,6,VOGEL,Sure. I just wish I could be more helpful. Would you like some dirt on any other orphans?
4,4,6,FRY,"Look, I'm trying to save someone here. I'll have to come back for those later."
4,4,6,FRY,Can you translate it?
4,4,6,FARNSWORTH,"Of course. But only into Beta Crypt 3, a language so complex, there's even less chance of understanding it."
4,4,6,FRY,I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse. I asked you to get busy.
4,4,6,FARNSWORTH,Very well.
4,4,6,FRY,Isn't that the same machine that makes noses?
4,4,6,FARNSWORTH,"It can do other things. Why shouldn't it? Of course, even if it is possible to analyse the message there's no way of knowing how long it would take. It could take an hour or it could take a hundred million years."
4,4,6,FRY,Is it done?
4,4,6,FARNSWORTH,Certainly not. Two dings means it's done. But not like that. Slightly more rapid.
4,4,6,LEELA,Where did they go?
4,4,6,BENDER,"Good news, Leela. I landed the contract to empty all the spitoons in Little Italy."
4,4,6,LEELA,Ew!
4,4,6,FARNSWORTH,"That's it, it's done! I can't believe it! My mind is boggling. The analysis of the note is printing out now."
4,4,6,DOCTOR,It's a girl.
4,4,6,MOTHER,My God! She's beautiful. No extra anythings.
4,4,6,FATHER,What people skills.
4,4,6,MOTHER,She's completely perfect!
4,4,6,DOCTOR,"In my professional opinion as an ear, ear, ear, nose and throat doctor, she is the least-mutated mutant ever born."
4,4,6,FATHER,And yet she's cursed to live the horrible degrading life of a mutant. Like all of us. Especially him!
4,4,6,LEG MUTANT,It's true!
4,4,6,MOTHER,Maybe we can do better for her.
4,4,6,FATHER,"I made this bracelet so that in some small way, we'll always be with you, even when it doesn't seem like it. During your entire life, for example."
4,4,6,MOTHER,"You won't pass for human, cutie. But if my PhD in exo-liguistics is worth diddly-poop, this note should convince them you're an alien. And that'll be enough to give you a real life."
4,4,6,FATHER,She'll never know we're her parents.
4,4,6,MOTHER,That's our gift to her. Better we should die than have her learn the shameful truth of her origin.
4,4,6,FATHER,I'm with you.
4,4,6,VOGEL,What a beautiful gigantic eye you ha -- . Well come on in.
4,4,7,HOODED FIGURE #1,Keep quiet so she doesn't hear us.
4,4,7,HOODED FIGURE #2,What's there to talk about?
4,4,7,HOODED FIGURE #1,Shhh!
4,4,7,LEELA,Hands up! Tentacles too!
4,4,7,HOODED FIGURE #1,"Don't say anything stupid, Morris."
4,4,7,LEELA,What is all this? Am I a game to you? Or some kind of even more boring Truman Show? Do you belive I'm you Messiah? Your Mutant Dali Lama? Stop me if I guess it!
4,4,7,HOODED FIGURE #2,Well actually there --
4,4,7,HOODED FIGURE #1,Morris! Shh!
4,4,7,LEELA,"And what about this?! How did you get this bracelet? Did you steal it from me when I was a baby? Or from my parents. You robbed my parents, didn't you? I bet you sick mutants killed them. My parents were confused aliens lost on Earth and you killed them! Is that it? Admit it!"
4,4,7,HOODED FIGURE #2,Yes. We killed them.
4,4,7,HOODED FIGURE #1,You guessed the truth.
4,4,7,LEELA,Because of you I'll never know my parents. I'll kill you!
4,4,7,HOODED FIGURE #1,That would be best.
4,4,7,FRY,Stop! Thanks Bender! Don't do it Leela!
4,4,7,LEELA,They killed my parents!
4,4,7,FRY,Close.
4,4,7,LEELA,They are my parents.
4,4,7,MUNDA,Yes.
4,4,7,FRY,I had the Professor analyse the alienese letter that was found with you.
4,4,7,LEELA,What does it say?
4,4,7,FRY,I 'unno. But the analysis showed it was printed on recycled toilet paper. A squeezably soft paper used mainly in the sewers.
4,4,7,MUNDA,"It says, ""Your parents love you very much""."
4,4,7,MORRIS,We still do.
4,4,7,LEELA,"So, I'm not an alien? I'm a mutant."
4,4,7,MORRIS,We never wanted you to know. You deserved a better life.
4,4,7,MUNDA,You must despise us.
4,4,7,LEELA,You're my parents. All I've ever wanted is to know you. This is the happiest moment of my life.
4,4,8,BENDER,Aww!
