4,6,0,"""A PHARAOH TO REMEMBER""","By Ron Weiner Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
4,6,0,LINDA [ON TV],"Up next, daring daylight robbery at a municipal swimming pool."
4,6,0,BENDER,Ooo! This is it! Turn me up!
4,6,0,LINDA [ON TV],"Earlier today a foul mouthed bandit robbed the municipal pool, making off with the contents of over three lockers."
4,6,0,BENDER,More like three lockers and a sink!
4,6,0,LEELA,Bender? Did you have something to do with this?
4,6,0,HERMES,Holy spitz! He's sportin' skintight speedos!
4,6,0,AMY,They don't leave much to the imagination.
4,6,0,HERMES,Actually on a robot they sorta do.
4,6,0,MORBO [ON TV],One puny human got a look at the robber...
4,6,0,BENDER,Here we go here we go!
4,6,0,MORBO [ON TV],"...describing him as a short, nasty, muscular..."
4,6,0,BENDER,Yeah make me famous big head!
4,6,0,MORBO [ON TV],...Caucasian human male.
4,6,0,BENDER,What?
4,6,0,FRY,Hey! Now what am I supposed to watch and drink all day?
4,6,0,BENDER,"This is an outrage. What's the point of pulling the biggest pool caper ever, if nobody knows you did it?"
4,6,0,FRY,Well there's the material rewards.
4,6,0,BENDER,You mean this junk?
4,6,0,BOY,Wheeee!
4,6,0,BENDER,All I ever wanted was for people to remember my name... it's Bender.
4,6,0,FARNSWORTH,Oh fuff! What's the point in remembering something? You're just going to forget it five seconds later.
4,6,0,BENDER,"It's so unfair. A debonair robot with a zesty in-your-face outlook doomed to obscurity like the rest of you especially Leela! If I died tomorrow, no one would even notice."
4,6,0,SCRUFFY,"Boy, I've never seen him so down - or ever before."
4,6,1,BENDER,How does a nobody like me get famous? I know! Hey look! I'm stuck! But I haven't given up hope! Call a soft news journalist!
4,6,1,WOMAN,You're not stuck.
4,6,1,BENDER,Shut up.
4,6,1,BENDER,Hey everyone do The Bender! This move's called The Bender!
4,6,1,ROLLER-SKATER,"Yo hotwheels, this circle's about free expression, not fascist moves!"
4,6,1,BENDER,A blank wall! Fame is mine!
4,6,1,BENDER,"There, now no one will forget how I lived or my attitude regarding butt."
4,6,1,SAL,Alrights ladies let's flush these artists lofts straights to hell!
4,6,1,BENDER,Nooo!
4,6,1,BENDER,I'm the first one to work. A new low.
4,6,1,ALL,Surprise!
4,6,1,FRY,Happy funeral Bender!
4,6,1,BENDER,A surprise funeral? For me?
4,6,1,FRY,We just wanted to show you that you really will be remembered.
4,6,1,BENDER,Ooo! Cushiony! And a minibar!
4,6,1,FRY,"Dearly beloved, we are here today to remember Bender, taken from us in the prime of life, when he was crushed by a runaway semi, driven by the Incredible Hulk."
4,6,1,BENDER,"Aww, you knew my favourite cause of death!"
4,6,1,FRY,Now let us each remember the best things about Bender in our own way. Professor?
4,6,1,FARNSWORTH,Your standard Bending Unit is made of an iron-osmium alloy. But Bender was different. Bender has a point-04% nickel impurity.
4,6,1,BENDER,It's what made me me.
4,6,1,HERMES,"If you ever needed a small package brought inot the country without a lot of X-raying and such, Bender always had a free body cavity."
4,6,1,BENDER,"Eh, the Professor's was better."
4,6,1,LEELA,Bender shush. You're supposed to be dead.
4,6,1,BENDER,Say more about how great I am. And where's the crying? You people look like you're waiting for the bus.
4,6,1,ZOIDBERG,"Oh Danny-boy! The pipes, the pipes are calling...!"
4,6,1,BENDER,Who-y-boy?
4,6,1,ZOIDBERG,...From glen to glen and down
4,6,1,BENDER,"Danny-boy? You're at my funeral, singing about some dead stiff named Danny-boy? You really are a massive bonehead."
4,6,1,ZOIDBERG,I'm expressing my sorrow.
4,6,1,BENDER,"Get lost. I'd say ""Don't quit your day job!"" but you're awful at that too."
4,6,1,LEELA,We're trying our best.
4,6,1,BENDER,Your best is an idiot. Let's pick it up people. So far it's been crap after crap! I croaked now show me some love!
4,6,1,AMY,Bender was a truly special -
4,6,1,BENDER,Louder and sadder.
4,6,1,AMY,Bender was a truly special
4,6,1,BENDER,Next!
4,6,1,PREACHERBOT,Dear Lord -
4,6,1,BENDER,Oh next!
4,6,1,ZOIDBERG,Oh Danny-boy!
4,6,1,BENDER,"Come on, surely there must be someone here who knows how great I was."
4,6,1,FRY,"Yes there is Bender. Bender was a lot of things to a lot of people, but looking back, the number one thing I can say about him is this, and simply this: Bender was my friend."
4,6,1,BENDER,What? That's it? Who are you? You're nobody! This is the worst funeral ever! I hope you're all happy. You've succeeded in convincing me life is worth living - by showing how bad my funeral will suck.
4,6,1,AMY,I know who's funeral we'll be attending next!
4,6,1,FARNSWORTH,Oh stop!
4,6,1,FARNSWORTH,News everyone! Today you're going to Osiris 4 to deliver this enourmous sandstone block.
4,6,1,FRY,I thought something looked different in here.
4,6,1,FRY,"Hi, we have a giant stone to deliver - sign here."
4,6,1,OSIRAN,"Ah, very nice. Much like the 10 million other identical stones used in the future tomb of our great Pharaoh Hermenthotip."
4,6,1,LEELA,"Impressive, who's building it?"
4,6,1,OSIRAN,You.
4,6,1,LEELA,Say again?
4,6,1,OSIRAN,You are now slaves of the great Pharaoh Hermenthotip. Guards.
4,6,1,FRY,"Call it a hunch but, I've got a bad feeling about this."
4,6,1,FRY,You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work but they don't pay you or let you go.
4,6,1,LEELA,That's the only thing about being a slave!
4,6,1,OSIRAN,"Attention. You are now possessions of the great Pharaoh Hermethotip, heir to the 10th dynasty, bringer of the good aspects of the annual floods."
4,6,1,FRY,Incredible. This place is just like the Ancient Egypt of my day.
4,6,1,OSIRAN,That is no coincidence. For our people visited your Egypt thousands of years ago.
4,6,1,FRY,I knew it! Insane theories: one! Regular theories: a billion!
4,6,1,OSIRAN,"We learned many things from the mighty Egyptians, such as pyramid building, space travel and how to prepare our dead so as to scare Abbott and Costello."
4,6,1,FRY,Also Wolfman!
4,6,1,BENDER,Look at these swanky tombs! These people really know how to die!
4,6,1,LEELA,Are you crazy? They worked thousands of people to death to make these stupid monuments.
4,6,1,BENDER,"Hey, you spend you're whole life building a guy's toe and you're gonna remember him! I think I'm gonna like it here!"
4,6,1,MAN #1,"Yeah, I uh, noticed your sign and I thought I'd come over here and look into getting involved in your program."
4,6,1,MAN #2,What we do is make you starve to death.
4,6,1,OSIRAN,One two three - pull! One two three - pull!
4,6,1,AUSTRALIAN GUY,"Aw, bloody chunder!"
4,6,1,BENDER,"Pick it up people, we're enslaved here to do a job. Master? Do we have to count to three every time? Couldn't we just count to one. Or better yet one half?"
4,6,1,OSIRAN,Good idea slave. One half - pull! One half - pull!
4,6,1,BENDER,Now we're slavin'!
4,6,1,BENDER,"Come on guy's, Pharaoh's countin' on us. Work faster, like this. You call that motivating me? Don't just whip with your arms. The power comes from your hips. Like this."
4,6,1,LEELA,"Bender, quit giving the slave drivers pointers!"
4,6,1,FRY,"Yeah, remember who your real friends are."
4,6,1,BENDER,I'll tell you who I remember. Enupsis! Pleeltut! Whatsisname! He was the greatest of all.
4,6,1,OSIRAN,Pharaoh Hermenthotip approaches.
4,6,1,BENDER,"Hurry! Hurry! Pharaoh's coming! Get that nose in place, come on!"
4,6,1,HERMENTHOTIP,Excellent work! I am very proud of all you slaves.
4,6,1,BENDER,Woohoo! Viva Hermenthotip!
4,6,1,HERMENTHOTIP,"And now, I have a grand announcement. In honour of your achievement, you're all hereby -"
4,6,1,BENDER,Nooo!
4,6,1,HERMENTHOTIP,Tell the slaves they can all go.
4,6,1,BENDER,Go faster? I told them but they're so damn lazy.
4,6,1,HERMENTHOTIP,No. I mean they are all free.
4,6,1,BENDER,Freeloading off you? I agree.
4,6,1,HERMENTHOTIP,"No, I -"
4,6,1,OSIRAN,Pharaoh Hermenthotip is dead.
4,6,1,BENDER,He's whippin' angels now.
4,6,1,HIGH PRIEST,We commend the body of Hermenthotip to the abode of the damned. The damned good looking! Pharaoh commanded me to tell that joke at his funeral.
4,6,1,BENDER,I'll always remember you Hermenthotip!
4,6,1,HIGH PRIEST,"To equip Pharaoh for his journey we bury him with his favourite possessions. Such as his heart and liver. And the many goods he left in his royal garage. Also, this bag of cat's our culture considers holy."
4,6,1,SINGER,"Pharaoh my God-king you are, cold and deceased. I used to have him sing...P-P-P-Pharaoh and his pets...but the years went by and Pharaoh died, Suzie will have joined him in the afterlife"
4,6,1,OSIRAN,"Hermenthotip is gone, the time to designate a new Pharaoh is at hand."
4,6,1,BENDER,Wow!
4,6,1,OSIRAN,At dawn tomrrow the high priest will consult the Wall Of Prophecy to determine Hermenthotip's successor.
4,6,1,BENDER,Woo!
4,6,1,OSIRAN,That concludes the funeral. You don't have to go home but you can't stay here.
4,6,1,FRY,Can you believe it? Pharaoh's dead!
4,6,1,SLAVE #1,Yes! Tonight we are slaves to no one - except the rhythm!
4,6,1,LEELA,Yeah! Play those bongos!
4,6,1,FRY,I'm gonna spin til I fall down!
4,6,2,BENDER,We interrupt this prophecy to bring you late breaking bulletin. He hammers the back of his head and creates and imprint of himself on the wall.
4,6,2,HIGH PRIEST,"Great Wall Of Prophecy, reveal to us God's will that we will blindly obey."
4,6,2,PRIESTS,Free us from thought and responsibility.
4,6,2,HIGH PRIEST,We shall read things off you.
4,6,2,PRIESTS,Then do them.
4,6,2,HIGH PRIEST,Your words guide us.
4,6,2,PRIESTS,We're dumb.
4,6,2,FRY,You know what else stinks about being a slave? The hours.
4,6,2,HIGH PRIEST,"The prophecy is strange and...crudely drawn at best. It indicates that, we are ""here"" and our next Pharaoh is over there near some...tents."
4,6,2,BENDER [FROM REEDS],"Those are waves jackass, it's supposed to be a river!"
4,6,2,FRY,"Hey, I think I know who the next Pharaoh is!"
4,6,2,LEELA,Oh Lord!
4,6,2,HIGH PRIEST,We hear your voice great Pharaoh. Reveal yourself to us.
4,6,2,BENDER,Behold! I have emerged from the place of spells and fairies!
4,6,2,HIGH PRIEST,It is he. Just as the Wall Of Prophecy prophesied. Long live Pharaoh Bender!
4,6,2,SLAVES,Long live Pharaoh Bender!
4,6,2,LEELA,This society is a bunch of idiots.
4,6,2,HIGH PRIEST,"People of Osiris 4, please welcome a man who started as a slave but worked his way up to lord of all creation! Our new Pharaoh - Bender!"
4,6,2,BENDER,Citizens of Me! The cruelty of the old Pharaoh is a thing of the past. Let a whole new wave of cruelty wash over this lazy land.
4,6,2,LEELA,What did he say?
4,6,2,BENDER,Hear the word of Pharaoh. Build unto me a statue of ridiculous proportion. One billion cubits in height......that I might be remembered for all eternity. And be quick about it!
4,6,2,BENDER,Lowly slave. Why are you not working?
4,6,2,SLAVE #2,I am.
4,6,2,BENDER,I meant yourself to death.
4,6,2,SLAVE #3,"Mighty Pharaoh, it hurts when I breathe."
4,6,2,BENDER,Well then what do you think you should stop doing? Crawl pigs!
4,6,2,LEELA,Ow!
4,6,2,BENDER,The Pharaoh has spoken.
4,6,2,BENDER,Your task is nearly completed. Don't let down Pharaoh now.
4,6,2,OSIRAN,"The great monument is finished oh Pharaoh. And now, the unveiling."
4,6,2,STATUE,Remember me. Remember me. Remember me.
4,6,2,OSIRAN,Does it please you my lord?
4,6,2,BENDER,"Hmm...its a good start. Uh...yeah it's definately big alright. I just wonder if it's too big y'know? I mean, are people gonna be remembering me or the statue?"
4,6,2,HIGH PRIEST,"But sire, we made it to your exact specifications."
4,6,2,BENDER,Too exact if you ask me. Tear it down and start again. But this time don't embarrass yourselves.
4,6,2,HIGH PRIEST,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Pharaoh...suddenly died!"
4,6,2,LEELA,Good riddance.
4,6,2,BENDER [FROM TOMB],What about my servants?
4,6,2,PRIEST,Oh yeah.
4,6,3,FRY,"Bender, I really hope that's you. 'Cause if it isn't......we're in trouble!"
4,6,3,LEELA,You jerk. Why'd you have to drag us along?
4,6,3,BENDER,I wanted to watch you remember me.
4,6,3,LEELA,Did you really think you'd need all this junk in the afterlife?
4,6,3,BENDER,Afterlife? Pfft. If I thought I had to go through a whole other life I'd kill myself right now!
4,6,3,LEELA,Well rot in peace. Fry and I are leaving.
4,6,3,BENDER,"Sorry but we're totally sealed in. Nothing can get in or out. Except millions of snakes. Here, have a pomergranate scnapps from my private distillery and start sharing fond memories of me, Bender."
4,6,3,FRY,What proof is this? Some huge number?
4,6,3,LEELA,It's explosive! Maybe we could escape by setting fire to the distillery and blowing this whole place to rubble! Let's get a little kindling going!
4,6,3,BENDER,"No! You can't blow up my monument, I won't be remembered."
4,6,3,LEELA,"Oh right, how selfish of me. We'll just stay here forever. Hey Fry, remember that robot ""Bender""?"
4,6,3,FRY,Bend-er? Doesn't ring a bell. Did you hear something Leela?
4,6,3,LEELA,No. But I bet it wasn't someone who was good at stealing.
4,6,3,BENDER,Stop it stop it! It's not right! You've crossed a line!
4,6,3,FRY,Hey Leela you know who I remember...?
4,6,3,BENDER,"Oh please, let it be me!"
4,6,3,FRY,...That guy who used to bend things. You know...?
4,6,3,BENDER,"Me, please!"
4,6,3,FRY,...Hermes.
4,6,3,BENDER,"Alright alright! If it means that much to you, blow up my statue!"
4,6,3,LEELA,Oh Bender! When did you come in? Hold still! Let's blow this tomb!
4,6,4,SLAVE #1,Pharaoh Bender! He once more walks among the living!
4,6,5,STATUE,Remember me!
4,6,5,BENDER,"I will. I will. Please, just leave me alone."
4,6,5,LEELA,"Bender, I understand your desire to be remembered. But you don't need a statue for that."
4,6,5,BENDER,I don't?
4,6,5,LEELA,No. You have your legacy as a brutal tyrannical dictator. And that will outlive any monument.
4,6,5,BENDER,You really think they'll remember me?
4,6,5,FRY,Absolutely.
4,6,5,BENDER,Well in that case. One planet down! Helmsman...
4,6,6,BENDER [FROM SHIP],...set course for Earth!
4,6,6,LEELA [FROM SHIP],That's not Earth.
4,6,6,BENDER [FROM SHIP],Oh.
