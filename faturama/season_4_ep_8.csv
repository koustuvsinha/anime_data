4,8,0,"""FUTURE STOCK""","By Aaron Ehasz Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
4,8,0,MAN,"Yes, good thing I noticed the similar shapes."
4,8,1,FARNSWORTH,Ohh!
4,8,1,AMY,There he is!
4,8,1,HATTIE (SHOUTING),Take it off!
4,8,1,FARNSWORTH,Where am I?
4,8,1,HERMES,Move forward. Walk into the light.
4,8,1,FARNSWORTH,"Oh God! I'm dead. Well, no matter. Thank you all for coming. I don't recognise any of you, nor can I recall why I am here. Now without further ado, a film highlighting Planet Express Inc.'s latest fiscal year."
4,8,1,NARRATOR [IN FILM],"Planet Express is on the move. For this young, hip delivery compnay, tomorrow is today and today is yesterday. You heard me. It was a year of soaring profits and significant one time losses."
4,8,1,ZOIDBERG,"I'll not only help you find it, I'll help you do more to it!"
4,8,1,FRY,"Ooo, a bot-mitzvah. Shalom hunger, shalom free food!"
4,8,1,ROBOT #1,No shellfish!
4,8,1,ZOIDBERG,That is so unfair!
4,8,1,PIG,Tell me about it.
4,8,2,FRY,So what's the deal? You guys don't believe in Robot Jesus?
4,8,2,ROBOT #2,We believe he was built and that he was a very well programmed robot but he wasn't our Messiah.
4,8,3,NARRATOR [IN FILM],"And so our company flames onwards. Planet Express: Limitless potential, boundless horizons, the unstoppable juggernaut of the corporate universe."
4,8,3,HERMES,It's been a terrible year people. The company is on the verge of bankruptcy.
4,8,3,LEELA,But the movie -
4,8,3,HERMES,Was a substantial loss for the company. The blue slice represent s the money we earned from shipping packages while the green slice represents an $8 bank error in our favour.
4,8,3,LEELA,This toads the wet sprocket. What about our thousands of shares of stock?
4,8,3,HERMES,Worthless.
4,8,3,BENDER (SHOUTING),I'll kill you!
4,8,3,HATTIE,I own one share of Planet kajiggers so I'm entitled to some answers. Question 1: Why does no one visit me in my home?
4,8,3,FARNSWORTH,'Cause your apartment smells like Polygrip and cat pee.
4,8,3,FRY,This is perfect for me.
4,8,3,ZOIDBERG,"Question: Do you have to have been cryogenically frozen to get the free - You didn't let me finish. I was going to say ""to get the free food."""
4,8,4,JOE,My name's Joe and I'm a defrostee.
4,8,4,EVERYONE,Hello Joe.
4,8,4,JOE,When I was frozen giant carrots ruled the Earth. But now they don't. It takes some getting used to.
4,8,4,THAT GUY,"Back in the 1980's I was the toast of Wall Street. I was having whiskey with Boesky and cookies with Milken. But then, I was diagnosed with terminal boneitis."
4,8,4,FRY,Boneitis? Pft! That's a funny name for a horrible disease.
4,8,4,THAT GUY,"There was no cure at the time. One drug company was close but I arranged a hostile takeover and sold off all the assets. Made a cool hundred mil. Naturally I froze myself until a cure was found. Now here I am, ready to sleaze my way back to the top, 80's style!"
4,8,4,CAVEMAN,As a caveman frozen in a glacier I face different challenges. The hardest thign was seeing my wife on display in the British Museum.
4,8,4,THAT GUY,Sure do! We can dance!
4,8,4,FRY,Y'know that dance wasn't as safe as they said it was.
4,8,4,THAT GUY,"I tell you, two go-go 80's Reganauts like us, we could rule this world!"
4,8,4,FRY,No question.
4,8,4,THAT GUY,If only someone would give us a shot.
4,8,4,FRY,"They're scared of our raw power. Oh but if you want a job, I could beg everyone at the company where I work."
4,8,4,THAT GUY,Awesome. Awesome to the max!
4,8,4,HERMES,"And finally, the post office meter is for business mail only."
4,8,4,BENDER,Aw come on! I got a lot of ransom notes to send!
4,8,4,HATTIE,Enough talk. It's time for action. I move that everyone come to my apartment to snuggle my cat.
4,8,4,SCRUFFY,Second.
4,8,4,FARNSWORTH,I move that your cat stinks and is ugly.
4,8,4,SCRUFFY,Second.
4,8,4,HATTIE,I move that we vote on a new Chief Executive Officer and oust this old creep. And also that make cat smells good and is pretty.
4,8,4,SCRUFFY,Second.
4,8,4,HERMES,Very well. I nominate the Professor.
4,8,4,AMY,Second.
4,8,4,LEELA,Second.
4,8,4,BENDER,Second.
4,8,4,FARNSWORTH,I'm your man.
4,8,4,LEELA,"I vote my 10,000 shares for the Professor."
4,8,4,HERMES,Yeah the Professor!
4,8,4,FARNSWORTH,Me!
4,8,4,FRY,I nominate That Guy. Not just because he has a suit but because he knows about business and stuff and he has a tie. My shares still count if they went through the washing machine right?
4,8,4,HERMES,"Well, if I know anything about which number is bigger than the other number, I'd say that -"
4,8,4,SCRUFFY,"Hold on there. Scruffy votes his 40,000 shares for the mysterious stranger."
4,8,4,LEELA,"40,000? How come you have four times as much stock as the rest of us?"
4,8,4,SCRUFFY,Scruffy believes in this company.
4,8,4,HERMES,"Then we have a tie. And in the event of a tie the Professor, as the current CEO remains -"
4,8,4,HATTIE,I demand the floor. I may only have one share but I get to vote same as anyone. And I'm voting against the cat hater. Isn't that right kitty? Hey! You ate my change!
4,8,4,HERMES,Then it's settled. The new chief executive officer of Planet Express corporation is That Guy.
4,8,4,HERMES,"Please welcome our new chief executive officer, That Guy."
4,8,4,THAT GUY,Let's cut to the chase. There are two kinds of people: sheep and sharks. Anyone who's a sheep is fired. Who's a sheep?
4,8,4,ZOIDBERG,Uh excuse me? Which is the one people like to hug?
4,8,4,THAT GUY,"Gutsy question, you're a shark. Sharks are winners and they don't look back 'cause they don't have necks. Necks are for sheep. I am proud to be the shepherd of this herd of sharks and I am gonna lead you to the top of this industry of...of..."
4,8,4,FRY (WHISPERING),Package delivery.
4,8,4,THAT GUY,Package delviery? Oh God! Fantastic! Now the first order of business is to blame everything on the guy before me. Professor?
4,8,4,FARNSWORTH,I'll ruin you like I ruined this company.
4,8,4,THAT GUY,Terrific. Question number one: What was your overall business plan?
4,8,4,FARNSWORTH,"Uh, um, uh business plan, uh, yes. I keep it here - right next to my heart."
4,8,4,THAT GUY,"This isn't a business plan, it's an escape plan."
4,8,4,FARNSWORTH,So long suckers!
4,8,4,THAT GUY,"Fry, as a fellow 80's dollar jockey, I'm making you my new vice chairman."
4,8,4,FRY,I'm rollin' up the corporate ramp.
4,8,4,BENDER,Ohh!
4,8,4,ZOIDBERG,It's the end of the line!
4,8,4,HERMES,We're ruined!
4,8,4,SCRUFFY,What fevered dream is this that bids to tear this company in twain?
4,8,4,MONSTER,Thank you come again!
4,8,4,THAT GUY,That's what I call a hostile makeover! Hair gel?
4,8,4,FRY,No thanks I make my own.
4,8,4,THAT GUY,This company's gonna shoot straight to the top and stay there! Like Cindy Lauper! I ask you: Who is the number one delivery service on Earth?
4,8,4,ZOIDBERG,Is it Planet Express master?
4,8,4,THAT GUY,Is this guy a shark or what? Seriously though we stink out loud. Here's the big enchirito. Mom's Friendly Delivery Company.
4,8,4,HERMES,"We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big, and evil. Ours is small and neutral."
4,8,4,THAT GUY,Switzerland is small and neutral. We're more like Germany; ambitious and misunderstood.
4,8,4,AMY,"Look, everyone wants to be like Germany but do we really have the pure strength of will?"
4,8,4,THAT GUY,I say we do! Now are we gonna let ourselves be beaten by an old lady?
4,8,4,ZOIDBERG,Yes my liege!
4,8,4,FRY,"No we're not. And as vice chairman, I believe I speak for the entire board when I issue this challenge to Mom. Look at my butt!"
4,8,5,MOM,"You call that a pressed ham? Walt, hit the retaliate button."
4,8,5,WALT,"Uh, um, hmm lets see."
4,8,5,MOM,Any button they all retaliate!
4,8,6,FRY,Woo yeah! Hit him hit him hit him! Now this is the high life! Watching apes mangle each other near celebrities!
4,8,6,THAT GUY,In my day we went to coke parties but the principle's the same.
4,8,6,CALCULON,Get your stinkin' trike off me you damn dirty ape.
4,8,6,THAT GUY,"Listen big guy, now that you're my prodégé, it's time I cut you in on the secret to success. Any guesses?"
4,8,6,FRY,"Uh, work really really hard?"
4,8,6,THAT GUY,No.
4,8,6,FRY,Oh thank God!
4,8,6,THAT GUY,It's all about appearances. That's why its time to update our company's stodgy image and give it the sleek dazzling veneer of the 1980's!
4,8,6,FRY,This company's on the fast track to the It List! Blast back kudos all around!
4,8,6,LEELA,Uh hello? We haven't made one delivery since you two took over.
4,8,6,THAT GUY,"Delivery has nothing to do with the delivery business. Image people, image! Scope out this new ad!"
4,8,6,MOM [ON AD],"We are all one. With one mind, one purpose and one act. Our enemy shall be eaten by scorpions! We shall bow down and worship to ourselves. We shall prevail!"
4,8,6,MAN [ON AD],Hey! We were watching that!
4,8,6,LEELA,That was terrible! People won't even know what we do.
4,8,6,BENDER,"I don't even know what we do. Nah just kidding, what are like a bus or something?"
4,8,6,LEELA,Did you approve that awful ad Fry?
4,8,6,FRY,Yes I did Leels! And I'll tell you why. Because it grows the brand.
4,8,6,LEELA,Oh Lord!
4,8,6,ZOIDBERG,This company's circling the drain I tell you. I'd sell my stock right now for a sangwich!
4,8,6,THAT GUY,Sold!
4,8,6,ZOIDBERG,A complete sangwich? You got fleeced! I would have settled for a hard roll with ketchup inside!
4,8,6,MOM,What is this moose drip? The new delivery kings? I'm sick of hearing about those turtle squirts!
4,8,6,IGNER,But they're kings mommy!
4,8,6,MOM,Jam a bastard in it you crap!
4,8,6,ELZAR,Enjoy our private dining room folks! This is where we serve our richest most successful chumps!
4,8,6,FRY,"Tonight, that's us!"
4,8,6,THAT GUY,What have you got that's really overpriced?
4,8,6,ELZAR,Everything.
4,8,6,THAT GUY,Bring me that.
4,8,6,FRY,Make it two. And a glass of all your water.
4,8,6,THAT GUY,
4,8,6,FRY,"Don't you worry about ""blank"" let me worry about ""blank."""
4,8,6,THAT GUY,"Very good. I also would have accepted ""Blank? Blank?! you're not looking at the big picture!"""
4,8,6,FRY (WEAKLY),What a pleasant surprise!
4,8,6,MOM,Shut up booger blaster! It's time the three of us had a talk.
4,8,6,THAT GUY,"I'll handle this Fry. You get back to the farm, shift some paradigms, revolutionise outside the box."
4,8,6,FRY,I'm on it. But if you need me you know where I'll be.
4,8,6,LEELA,Fry we're worried about Planet Express.
4,8,6,FRY,Don't you worry about Planet Express. Let me worry about blank!
4,8,6,HERMES,That Guy is nothing but a flashy con man! And you've been hypnotised by his swinging blogney!
4,8,6,LEELA,You've changed Fry.
4,8,6,FRY,What? I haven't changed. Suz? Have I changed?
4,8,6,SUZ [ON INTERCOM],No sir Mr Fry.
4,8,6,FRY,Thanks doll.
4,8,6,LEELA,"I don't care what Ms Johnson says, Thst Guy's turning this place into some kind of...business."
4,8,6,FARNSWORTH,"This isn't a business, I've always thought of it as more of a source of cheap labour. Like a family."
4,8,6,FRY,"You're right Professor. We might not be a traditional family like the Murphy's next door or the lesbian coven across the street but we are a family, and That Guy understands that."
4,8,6,THAT GUY [ON SCREEN],Everyone's fired and we're out of business.
4,8,6,AMY,Oh no.
4,8,6,HERMES,How?
4,8,6,THAT GUY [ON SCREEN],I'm gonna sell Planet Express to Mom so she can gut the company and eliminate us as competitors.
4,8,6,MOM [ON SCREEN],Don't let the door hit you on your way out. 'Cause I don't want ass prints on my new door!
4,8,6,FRY,Uh Ms Johnson? Please bring in some more chair fuel.
4,8,6,FRY,I had no idea the company would be sold. I was just an innocent suck up. You've gotta believe me!
4,8,6,LEELA,Just leave us alone and let us clear out our lockers.
4,8,6,BENDER,Yeah.
4,8,6,AMY (CRYING),"It's so sad, where will I go? What will I do?"
4,8,6,LACKEY,You have Mrs Darlinghaven's cotillion at 7 ma'am.
4,8,6,AMY (CRYING),Oh. That'll be fun.
4,8,6,FRY,"Ms Johnson, you've never lied to me. Am I still a good person?"
4,8,6,SUZ [ON INTERCOM],I don't know sir. I'm a program built into the intercom.
4,8,6,FRY,"I've got to redeem myself. Somehow, sometime, for some reason. I'll block this takeover!"
4,8,6,SUZ [ON INTERCOM],"Mr Fry, your 2 o'clock magician is here."
4,8,6,FRY,"Believe it or not, I have more important things to do today than laugh and clap my hands. Reschedule."
4,8,7,BROKERBOT #1,Sell 100 soylent beans!
4,8,7,BROKERBOT #2,Buy 1000 cornbellies!
4,8,7,BROKERBOT #3,200 cans of whoop-ass!
4,8,7,BROKERBOT #1,Three big bags of trash!
4,8,7,JOR-EL,Attention please. The takeover of PlanEx Corp by Mom's Friendly Company will take place in the business centre in 10 minutes. I am Jor-El! Master of scheduling!
4,8,7,THAT GUY,
4,8,7,BENDER,You suck!
4,8,7,MOM,"According to regulations, both companies must approve the takeover. Planet Express shareholders, cast your votes."
4,8,7,HERMES,Great Bonda of Uganda! We can vote against it!
4,8,7,BENDER,I'll vote it down like a raise for school teachers!
4,8,7,BENDER,What the?
4,8,7,HATTIE,How the?
4,8,7,AMY,Oh no.
4,8,7,THAT GUY,I neglected to mention that the shares I bought from Dr Zoidberg gave me majority control.
4,8,7,LEELA,Zoidberg owned 51% of the company?
4,8,7,HERMES,The shares were worthless and he kept asking for toilet paper.
4,8,7,MOM,And now if Momcorp shareholders will cast their ballots.
4,8,7,IGNER,"Um...uh... Uh, the ballot was confusing."
4,8,7,MOM,How about a hand recount?
4,8,7,IGNER,
4,8,7,MOM,The takeover of Planet Express is approved.
4,8,7,AMY,This stinks!
4,8,7,LACKEY,Madam is outraged.
4,8,7,THAT GUY,"Security, I want that bunch of rowdies out of here."
4,8,7,BENDER,Hold on a minute!
4,8,7,SCRUFFY,Hey! Hey!
4,8,7,MOM,Momcorp will now purchase all outstanding shares of Planet Express at the current market price which is...
4,8,7,107.,
4,8,8,BENDER,Ow! And also it hurt my feelings!
4,8,8,LEELA,They are? Oh my God! I'm a millionaire! Suddenly I have an opinion about that capital gains tax!
4,8,8,BENDER,Yeah all right!
4,8,8,AMY,I'm even richer!
4,8,8,ZOIDBERG,Oh! I have no shares! Wait! My sangwich! Has it also appreciated in value? Please oh please!
4,8,8,HERMES,You didn't even refrigerate it you spineless lobster!
4,8,8,ZOIDBERG,You had to drag spines into this!
4,8,8,FRY [ON SCREEN],"As vice chairman of Planet Express I'd like to say a few words. There comes a time for every man who becomes rich and deserts his friends, when he goes back how it was. For me, that time is now...."
4,8,9,FRY,"...So I ask you, as a friend, won't you stop this deal?"
4,8,9,THAT GUY,Fry I'm an 80's guy. Friendship means to me that for two bucks I'd beat you with a pool cue 'til you got detached retinas. The deal will go ahead as - My bones!
4,8,9,FRY,Oh my God! His boneitis!
4,8,9,THAT GUY,"I was so busy being an 80's guy, I forgot to cure it. My only regret is...that I have...boneitis!"
4,8,9,FRY,He's dead.
4,8,9,MOM,"Pry out his fillings, feed him to the jackals and lets get on with the sale."
4,8,9,FRY,I don't think so. 'Cause as vice chairman of the company I gain voting control of his shares.
4,8,9,MOM,Don't be a fool you idiot!
4,8,9,FRY,I'll be whatever I wanna do! That Guy was the greatest businessman that ever lived and before his mysterious death he taught me everything he knew. But some things I had to learn myself. I learned that money is fine but in the end what counts is people... ...People you love... ...You can't put a price on that... So I'm giving up control of the company... ...to a man of enourmous experience... ...Professor... ...Hubert Farnsworth.
4,8,9,FARNSWORTH,"Oh uh what? I'm awake, I'm awake!"
4,8,9,BENDER,"Fry, stop doing the right thing you jerk!"
4,8,9,LEELA,Let Mom buy the company! We all wanna be filthy stinking rich!
4,8,9,ZOIDBERG,Trust me two out of three doesn't cut it!
4,8,9,FRY,You mean you'd rather be rich than work together?
4,8,9,LEELA,Hell yeah!
4,8,9,FRY,In my whole life this company was the only place I ever really felt at home. If being millionaires is more important to you than our...
4,8,9,BENDER,It is!
4,8,9,FRY,"...friendship, then I'll sell Planet Express, for you."
4,8,9,HATTIE,Millionaires nothing! The stock's only worth three kajiggers!
4,8,9,BENDER,Oh come on!
4,8,9,HERMES,My Jah! It's worth less now than when it was worthless!
4,8,9,FRY,It is? Yahoo! We're poor no matter what I do! The deal is off!
4,8,9,ZOIDBERG,Aha! Once again the conservative sangwich-heavy portfolio pays off for the hungry investor! Oh! I'm ruined. Why? Why?
4,8,9,FRY,"Look, so we're not millionaires. At least we all still get to work together!"
4,8,9,BENDER,Shut your fat mouth!
4,8,9,FRY (SHOUTING),See you guys Monday!
