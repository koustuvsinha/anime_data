4,9,0,"""A LEELA OF HER OWN""","By Patric M. Verrone Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
4,9,0,LEELA,Oh put down the binoculars Fry. The wall of that strip club isn't going to collapse twice in one day.
4,9,0,FRY,"I know, and I've grown to accept that. Now I'm more interested in that new pizza parlour across the street. Kinda makes me pine for my days as a pizza delivery boy. ""Here's you pizza,"" I'd say. ""I didn't order any,"" they'd say. And then I'd be off to my next adventure."
4,9,0,LEELA,That story stunk. Hand me the binoculars. I think the owner is from Cygnus 5.
4,9,0,FARNSWORTH,Cygnoids? On our block? Flying foo! They should go back where they came from.
4,9,0,LEELA,Professor please. Society's never gonna make any progress until we all learn to pretend to like each other. Now lets go over there and make these hideous strangers feel welcome.
4,9,0,FARNSWORTH,No.
4,9,0,CYGNOID WOMAN,You sure about these chairs? Guidebook says human legs bend down at knee.
4,9,0,CYGNOID MAN,"It's OK Mama, anyone complains, I bend legs up for free. Ooo customers! Welcome to Earth pizza store. Here, sit, I bend knees for you."
4,9,0,BENDER,Ooo that's a-comfy!
4,9,0,CYGNOID MAN,
4,9,0,FRY,"Uh, hmm, do you have any food?"
4,9,0,CYGNOID MAN,"Here, try a deep dish pizza. Contains four kind of things."
4,9,0,LEELA,I don't mean to offend but this tastes like vomit.
4,9,0,CYGNOID WOMAN,Thank you.
4,9,0,LEELA,"No, actually I did mean to offend a little. This is awful."
4,9,0,FRY,"Hey hey, what's wrong? Was it something Leela said?"
4,9,0,CYGNOID WOMAN,"We come to Earth to start new life. Raise fat spoiled Earth kids, hang many underwear from Earth clothesline, live Earthican dream."
4,9,0,FRY,"Aww, don't cry foreign people. I used to work in a pizzeria and as soon as I stop hallucinating and blasting puke, I'm gonna teach you to sell pizza - Earth style!"
4,9,0,CYGNOID WOMAN,Oh thank you magic biped!
4,9,0,CYGNOID MAN,"You save us sir, if we cannot make Earth pizza our dream will die. Just like rats we crushed to make the wine."
4,9,0,FRY,"For starters, only use quality ingredients. Case in point: No more live bees. Oregano works equally well. And when you put pizzas in the oven, don't get in with them."
4,9,0,CYGNOID #2,"Hey, ocupado!"
4,9,0,FRY,"Most important of all is the big screen TV. Human families need a TV when they're eating so they don't have to talk to each other. Ah, the Earthican pasttime, blernsball!"
4,9,0,UECKER [ON TV],"Mulligan drives the ball, it's going, going and caught by the shortstop. Man I haven't seen play this bad since the days of Bob Uecker! This is Bob Uecker saying thanks for watching!"
4,9,0,CYGNOID MAN,Mets? Shortstop? Pinching the hitter? I don't understand this blernsball.
4,9,0,FRY,Well if you're going to be Earthicans we'll have to teach you. How about your pizzeria plays a game against Planet Express? Oh but you'll need nine players.
4,9,0,CYGNOID WOMAN,No problem!
4,9,0,CYGNOID #2,Play the ball!
4,9,0,FARNSWORTH,Go team! Beat those no good Cygnoids! Show them they stink at a game they've never played before!
4,9,0,CYGNOID MAN,"Ah, this is why I love Earth! Beautiful star brightened day, friendly blernsball game with chum pals! So pleasant for everybody."
4,9,0,SCRUFFY,"Hit by a pitch, take your base."
4,9,0,LEELA,"Sorry about that, I guess I needed a few more warm-up pitches."
4,9,0,BENDER,No batter! No batter! No batter anymore.
4,9,0,SCRUFFY,Take your base.
4,9,0,LEELA,"I didn't mean to hit you, I have some trouble with depth perception."
4,9,0,CYGNOID #2,"Yeah, me too now."
4,9,0,BENDER,Hey batter batter batter! Hey batter batter batter! Hey batter batter! Duck!
4,9,0,SCRUFFY,Take your base.
4,9,0,CYGNOID #3,"Please lady, I want to live. Can I use bat to protect head?"
4,9,0,BENDER,Apparently not.
4,9,0,MAN,Check out the one eyed bean machine!
4,9,0,CYGNOID MAN,Hooray! I make a score point!
4,9,0,FRY,"Leela, you beaned a run-in. You'd better let me pitch."
4,9,0,LEELA,But I've got a no-hitter going. You're right. Here.
4,9,0,RANDY,"Don't take her out, she's a firecracker!"
4,9,0,COMMISSIONER,"Excuse me, I'd like to talk to you."
4,9,0,LEELA,Am I under arrest?
4,9,0,BENDER,Wait I know you. You're the sleabag who owns the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.
4,9,0,COMMISSIONER,Not anymore. Now I'm the sleazebag who owns the New New York Mets.
4,9,0,LEELA,The Mets? Those bums are worse than me.
4,9,0,COMMISSIONER,Close to it. But they don't draw a crowd like you. Which is why I wanna sign you to the team.
4,9,0,LEELA,You mean I'd be the first woman ever to play major league blernsball?
4,9,0,COMMISSIONER,Well yeah but basically you'd just be a publicity stunt. I figured a one-eyed lady skull buster might bring out the freakshow crowd.
4,9,0,LEELA,"Wow, the first woman ever to play major league blernsball."
4,9,0,COMMISSIONER,"Again yeah, but basically you'd -"
4,9,0,LEELA,Yippee!
4,9,0,LEELA,Ta-da! The first woman ever to play major league blernsball. How do I look?
4,9,0,HERMES,Like a sexy Yogi Berra!
4,9,0,FARNSWORTH,Why is your number seven-eight's?
4,9,0,LEELA,All the whole numbers have been retired.
4,9,0,FRY,"Wow, I must say I'm impressed. You look just like a ball player. Can I pat you on the butt?"
4,9,0,LEELA,Fry I'm a professional athlete! So go ahead.
4,9,0,FRY,"Ohh, now I'm too nervous."
4,9,1,UECKER,Well folks it's only the fifth inning but the Swedes have already turned this one into a laffer. And that's with two F's. The crowd is pouring out of the stadium LA style.
4,9,3,COMMISSIONER,"Skipper, we're losing the crowd. Put it our new novelty act - Leela."
4,9,3,SKIPPER,Darn it! I already put in the circus clown.
4,9,3,COMMISSIONER,Yeah but he bunted. Clowns are only funny when they swing away.
4,9,5,WOMAN,Woo! Come on! Throw like a girl!
4,9,5,FRY,Go Leela!
4,9,5,BENDER,Come on girl!
4,9,5,AMY,Too much eyeliner!
4,9,6,UECKER,This is history in the making folks. Bjornson steps up to the plate and Leela delivers.
4,9,7,BENDER,Bullseye!
4,9,8,UECKER,Ooo! An inauspicious start for the career of the first woman blernsballer. An inauspicious continuation for the career of the first woman blernsballer.
4,9,9,CROWD,Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean...
4,9,11,UECKER,Ouch! It's a three bean-ball salad. The Mets fans love it though and who can blame them? They haven't had much to cheer about this year -
4,9,11,COMMISSIONER,"Kid that was great! You got us more publicity than a cowboy in a shark tank. Poor Tex, he was quite a shark."
4,9,11,MAN #1,Hey!
4,9,11,MAN #2,Hey!
4,9,11,MAN #3,C'mon!
4,9,11,MAN #4,I win!
4,9,11,BENDER,Oop! Sorry.
4,9,11,LEELA,"Bender, how did you get in here?"
4,9,11,LEELA,Since when are you my agent?
4,9,11,BENDER,"Quiet, call coming in. Yeees...? A big endorsement deal for Leela? How much...? Hey! You put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass...! Deal!"
4,9,11,LEELA,Bender that's great! How much did you get me?
4,9,11,BENDER,One hundred dollars.
4,9,11,LEELA,"As a pitcher, I serve up plenty of bean-balls, so I know good beans when I see them. Bean-Bay Beans - they're the beaniest!"
4,9,11,DIRECTOR,Cut!
4,9,12,UECKER,In very short order Leela has become a fan favourite.
4,9,13,BENDER,You're the best babe! Hang on call comin' in. What's that...? Hey you put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass...! Deal!
4,9,13,LEELA,So what did you get me?
4,9,13,BENDER,A thousand and one pesos!
4,9,13,LEELA,"Yo soy muy malo en lanzar, pero yo soy muy bueno en comer frijoles. Come los Bean Bay frijoles, los frijoles de los reyes."
4,9,13,DIRECTOR,"Cut! OK, now do one with bean suit on!"
4,9,14,CYGNOID MAN,Leela really bringing in the customers.
4,9,14,CYGNOID WOMAN,This keep up we need to buy second sauce toilet.
4,9,14,GIRL,When I grow up I want to injure men by throwing stuff at them just like you Leela! Will you sign my magazine?
4,9,14,LEELA,"Aww, sure thing sweetie. Who should I make it out to?"
4,9,14,GIRL,"Well, uh...to eBay?"
4,9,14,LEELA,"That's a popular name today. Little ""e"" big ""B""?"
4,9,14,BENDER,"Five bucks an autograph, 200 fans. Add a one and two zeros in front of that and we got ourselves a wad!"
4,9,14,LEELA,I'm not doing this for the wad. I'm doing it for all the struggling female athletes who need a role model.
4,9,14,WOMAN,"Yeah, a role model in how to stink!"
4,9,14,LEELA,What? Who are you?
4,9,14,WOMAN,Jackie Anderson. I'm on the blernsball team at NNYU and I was hoping to get to play in the majors soon.
4,9,14,LEELA,"Oh, following in my footsteps?"
4,9,14,JACKIE,"Pft, God forbid! Your little freakshow is making it impossible for real female ball players to be taken seriously. I hope you're proud of yourself."
4,9,14,BENDER,"Alright shows over no refunds, you heard the robot get out!"
4,9,14,LEELA,"I'm a fool. The fans haven't been cheering for me, they've been cheering at me."
4,9,14,AMY,"Don't be upset Leela. You, um...you look really cute in your uniform."
4,9,14,LEELA,That's what makes it so sad. I thought I was doing something heroic.
4,9,14,BENDER,You are. What about that little girl you visited in the hospital? You know the one I mean? The one who died?
4,9,14,LEELA,"You're right. I can't let people down anymore. As God as my witness, I vow to earn the respect of girls and women everywhere. I will become the best blernsball player of all time."
4,9,14,HERMES,"That's statistically impossible. In 77 innings you haven't gotten a single out. At this rate, you're sure to go down as the worst blernsball player of all time."
4,9,14,LEELA,Oh. Then I have a new vow. I solemnly swear that I will become not the worst blernsball player of all time.
4,9,14,FRY,Hey look! The player's who broke the various colour barriers!
4,9,14,BENDER,When will Man learn that all races are equally inferior to robots?
4,9,15,LEELA,"Ah, here we are - the worst player in history. If I can be just a little better than him I can slink away with my head held high."
4,9,15,BENDER,It says he once struck out when his tongue got stuck to an unusually cold bat.
4,9,15,FRY,And here he is trying to make a catch with an oven mit.
4,9,15,LEELA,It's even a crummy hologram.
4,9,15,AARON JR,"I'm not a hologram, though I am crummy. Hank Aaron XXIV."
4,9,15,FRY,Hank Aaron XXIV? How could you play so blowfully? The original Hank Aaron was great!
4,9,15,AARON SR,No I was better than great. I was the home run king!
4,9,15,BENDER,Neat!
4,9,15,LEELA,"So Hank - the bad Hank, just how blowful were you?"
4,9,15,AARON JR,"Well, I have a low batting average."
4,9,15,AARON SR,Low? It was zero you fungo! You went your whole career without getting a hit.
4,9,15,FRY,Leela could beat that. She's pitched her whole career without getting an out.
4,9,15,AARON SR,"You stink lady! Hey Junior, she belongs in the exhibit instead of you."
4,9,15,AARON JR,"Forget it. This job's too cushy to give up. Aah Wade Boggs, goes down smooth!"
4,9,15,LEELA,"Look, I don't wanna be in this exhibit. That's why I need your help - so I can be one tiny iota less pathetic than you."
4,9,15,AARON JR,"Oh I can't help you play better than Tiny Iota, that guy was great! But I'll teach you everything I know."
4,9,15,AARON JR,
4,9,15,BENDER,One thing she can do is lodge a ball in the depth centre of your brain. You better get a batting helmet.
4,9,15,LEELA,"Alright, low and away!"
4,9,15,AARON JR,
4,9,15,LEELA,"You mean ""keep your eye on the ball""?"
4,9,15,AARON JR,"Hey lady, which one of us is in the hall of fame?"
4,9,15,FRY,"Psst, you're holding the bat upside down."
4,9,15,AARON JR,Just pitch the ball.
4,9,15,LEELA,
4,9,15,BENDER,Strike!
4,9,15,FRY,Hooray!
4,9,15,AARON JR,You did it Leela!
4,9,15,LEELA,I didn't hit the batter! For once I was pitching and not just belly-itching!
4,9,15,AARON JR,Oh you got that too? I think there's a rash goin' around.
4,9,17,UECKER,"Welcome to Fenway Park, home of the Boston Poindexters where the Mets close out a season that'll rank among mankind's most awful crimes."
4,9,18,FRY,Hey! You opened a franchise!
4,9,18,CYGNOID WOMAN,"Yes. Our biggest seller is Leela's Bean Pizza. Six kinds of beans, plus several things that look like beans."
4,9,18,FISHY JOE,"Beans huh? Mmm, this is great! How to you make the crust so fizzy?"
4,9,18,CYGNOID MAN,Ah-ah-ah! Ancient Cygnoid secret!
4,9,18,CYGNOID WOMAN,"My husband, some hotshot! Here's his ancient Cygnoid secret! Live hornets! We smush them right into dough!"
4,9,18,FISHY JOE,I don't care if there's horse manure in it!
4,9,18,CYGNOID MAN,That's a-good!
4,9,18,FISHY JOE,"I wanna buy this franchise. How does $100,000 sounds?"
4,9,18,CYGNOID MAN,"Forget it, we come to Earth to make pizza not money!"
4,9,18,CYGNOID WOMAN,No Blek! Other way around!
4,9,18,CYGNOID MAN,"Oh right, offer accepted!"
4,9,19,UECKER,"Well fans Boston's turning the last game into a real squeeeker! And that's with three ""e's""! Two men on and they're down to their last out."
4,9,20,LEELA,"Come on skipper, it's my last chance to prove I'm not the worst player ever. Please put me in."
4,9,20,SKIPPER,No. We're actually winning this game. You only go in as a joke when we're eight runs behind. Or when our other pitchers sneak out early to beat the traffic. Come on! Lets see some fundamentals out there! And not clown fundamentals.
4,9,22,SKIPPER,"Aw, darn, darn it! Now the bases are loaded. Isn't there a man on this team who can get one more out?"
4,9,22,LEELA,I can.
4,9,22,SKIPPER,I repeat: Isn't there a man on this team on this -
4,9,22,LEELA,I've been training with Hank Aaron.
4,9,22,SKIPPER,You've been training with the Hank Aaron?
4,9,22,LEELA,I've been training with a Hank Aaron.
4,9,22,SKIPPER,Alright then. Get in there and pitch like you've never pitched like you before!
4,9,24,CROWD,Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean!
4,9,24,FARNSWORTH,Go Leela!
4,9,24,AMY,Come on Leela!
4,9,24,BENDER,Put it right down the pike!
4,9,24,FRY,Strike him out Leela! Do it for the hundreds of women everywhere!
4,9,26,UECKER,Would you look at that! College blernsball's finest female hitter making her big league debut against pro-ball's worst female anything! I've never seen anything this bizzare - and I've seen Mr Belvendere naked! Woo!
4,9,27,LEELA,"Keep cool, she's just like any other player. She puts on her sports bra one arm at a time."
4,9,27,UMPIRE,Strike one!
4,9,27,LEELA,Strike one - a personal best!
4,9,27,UMPIRE,Strike two!
4,9,32,UECKER,"A grand slam blern. The Mets lose, their season is over! And no question, Leela - the first woman ever to reach the majors will go down as the single worst player in the history of blernsball...!"
4,9,33,UECKER,...And yet tonight we have witnessed the beginning of a great career for the first woman to play the sport well - Jackie Anderson!
4,9,34,JACKIE,Leela?
4,9,34,LEELA,"Jackie. I guess you were right, I'm a lousy role model. I'm sorry."
4,9,34,JACKIE,"No, don't be. It turns out you were an inspiration afterall."
4,9,34,LEELA,I was?
4,9,34,JACKIE,"Uh-huh. You were so awful that women everywhere set out to prove that they don't stink as bad as you. You know, like a pig or something."
4,9,34,LEELA,"Oh, that's so kind of you. I guess I made a difference afterall!"
4,9,34,JACKIE,"You absolutely did Leela. Now please, please retire! Immediately!"
4,9,34,LEELA,Hey kid! Catch!
4,9,34,AARON SR,"Well, at least you're still the worst football player of all time."
4,9,34,AARON JR,Yeah. Yeah.
