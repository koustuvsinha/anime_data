5,1,0,"""JURASSIC BARK""","By Eric Kaplan Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
5,1,0,BENDER,"Ahem! For my next trick, notice I have nothing up my sleeves......and nothing in my head. So if my lovely assistant will kindly supply me with an ordinary, non-fake pitcher of milk......behold the milk has vanished! Exiled, perhaps, to another dimension!"
5,1,0,FRY,"Amazing! That's why they call you ""Bender The Magnificent""!"
5,1,0,BENDER,No it isn't!
5,1,0,FRY,"Whoa! They discovered an intact, 20th Century pizzeria! Just like the one I used to work at!"
5,1,0,BENDER,Interesting. No wait the other thing - tedious!
5,1,0,FRY,Lets go check it out. You can see how I lived before I met you.
5,1,0,BENDER,You lived before you met me?
5,1,0,FRY,Sure. Lots of people did.
5,1,0,BENDER,Really?
5,1,1,BENDER,"Truly, they were as Gods who build this place!"
5,1,1,TOUR GUIDE,"Next, we come to the splendidly preserved wooden pizza paddle. Scientists theorise it was used to gently discipline the delivery boy."
5,1,1,FRY,"Wait a second! This is Panucci's! I used to work in this exact pizzeria! And for your information lady, this was not just used to paddle my butt, it was also used to move pizzas and crush rats."
5,1,1,TOUR GUIDE,I don't know where you get your facts sir but I am a volunteer housewife with 45 minutes of orientation and a harlequin romance about archeologists!
5,1,1,FRY,"Don't wave your fancy degrees at me. I recognise all this stuff. Petrified sausages, Old Mr Patelli, and that's"
5,1,1,VOICE [ON BUZZER.],Yes?
5,1,1,FRY,Pizza delivery for Mr......Seymour Asses.
5,1,1,VOICE [ON BUZZER.],There's no one by that name here...or anywhere. I hope that in time you'll realise what an idiot you've been.
5,1,1,FRY,I wouldn't count on it.
5,1,2,FRY,"Aww. Poor little guy. You look like you haven't eaten in a month. Here......but if Mr Panucci asks, your name is Seynour Asses! I like you Seymour, you're not constantly judging me like all the other dogs - are you? Nah. We understand each other. People think you're a dumb mutt who smells bad, can't find a girlfriend and has a crummy job. But you're keepin' it real and call no man ""Mister."" Well goodbye. Live long and prosper."
5,1,3,BENDER,Yuck! That's the least appetising calzone I've ever seen!
5,1,3,FRY,No! That's my dog in there! It's an outrage I say!
5,1,3,BENDER,Ow ow ow!
5,1,3,FRY,I'm taking him home and I'd like to see anyone try and stop me. Uh-oh!
5,1,4,FRY,"Ow, oo ow, oo ah!"
5,1,4,BENDER,"...And then he was ejected by the guards. Needless to say, I was mortified."
5,1,4,FRY,Well it's not right to make my dead pet an exhibit. That's like digging up Lassie and putting her on display in the Louvre.
5,1,4,AMY,Lassie is on display in the Louvre.
5,1,4,FRY,"I know, I was deliberately describing a similar situation."
5,1,4,FARNSWORTH,Why don't you try protesting? Like those native Martians. Always whining that people don't treat their ancestor's bones with respect.
5,1,4,BENDER,"Nah, protesting never works."
5,1,4,FRY,You're right. I'll give it a shot!
5,1,4,CROWD (CHANTING),What do you want?
5,1,4,CROWD,When do you want it?
5,1,4,CROWD,Yaaay!
5,1,4,LEELA,It says this part of The Hustle implores the Gods to grant a favour. Usually a Trans-AM.
5,1,4,FRY (SINGING),I'm walking on sunshine! Ooo-oo-ooh! I'm walking on sunshine! Ooo-oo-ooh! At a boy Seymour! Right here waiting for me as always! Just like that huge mushroom in my shower!
5,1,5,PANUCCI,"Hey there's our little mascot! Aww you been swimming in the sewer again? You little rascal! Fry, cleanup!"
5,1,5,FRY,"Seymour, cleanup! Good dog!"
5,1,5,PANUCCI,That's a good Seymour!
5,1,5,BOY,Yo! There's dog fur on my slice!
5,1,5,PANUCCI,"Nah, that's vermicelli! No fur in here!"
5,1,5,FRY,He's so cute! He can do two things at one time: Eat and swim. Ooo - three things.
5,1,5,LEELA,"Fry, its been three days. You can't keep boogie-ing like this. You'll come down with a fever of some sort."
5,1,5,BEELER,"Mr. Fry? I'm Dr Ben Beeler, the paleontologist who discovered your dog, or as some call it, the Beeler-saurus."
5,1,5,FRY,So do I get Seymour back? Are you caving to political pressure?
5,1,5,BEELER,No we're sorry but there's just too much that fossil can teach us about dogs from your time.
5,1,5,FRY,"His name was Seymour. He was once intimate with the leg of a wandering saxaphonist. He had wet dog smell, even when dry. And he was not above chasing the number 29 bus."
5,1,5,RAY,The 29? Interesting.
5,1,5,BEELER,"That's all I needed, Ray?"
5,1,5,RAY,I'm good.
5,1,5,BEELER,
5,1,5,FRY,Seymour!
5,1,5,BENDER,Lady and Gentleman! How 'bout a hand for my temporary replacement assistant?
5,1,5,ZOIDBERG,I was all in this part! Its magic!
5,1,5,BENDER,You are not fit to wear Fry's leotard!
5,1,5,ZOIDBERG,Stop!
5,1,5,FRY,Good news everyone!
5,1,5,BENDER,"Hooray, he's back! He's looking for a garbage can to put that dog in! Here you go buddy!"
5,1,5,FARNSWORTH,"No, actually we've discovered Fry's dog was fast-fossilised, preserving it's cellular structure!"
5,1,5,FRY,Which means...we can clone it! Seymour will live again!
5,1,5,ZOIDBERG,A little land mammal!
5,1,5,FRY,Can you believe it Bender? I'm going to have my best friend back!
5,1,5,CUBERT,Why the idiot convention?
5,1,5,FARNSWORTH,"Ah Cubert, my precious babe. I'm going to attempt to clone Fry's dog. Using the very same apparatus I used to clone you! Ooo look, there's a smidge of toe still in here. You see, beneath the fossil's crunchy, mineral shell, there's still a creamy core of dog nougat!"
5,1,5,FRY,So will Seymour remember how to sing Walking On Sunshine?
5,1,5,FARNSWORTH,"Amazingly yes. In cases of rapid fossilisation, I can press this brain scan button, retrieving Seymour's memories at the precise instant of doggy death!"
5,1,5,FRY,"I'm gonna get my puppy back! In your face, Grim Reaper!"
5,1,5,BENDER,Crappy ineffective Reaper!
5,1,5,FARNSWORTH,I just need to reset the Clone-O-Mat from Human Mode to Dog Mode.
5,1,5,WOMAN'S VOICE,The dog says
5,1,5,FARNSWORTH,"Uh-oh, this may take a while."
5,1,5,KID,You stink loser!
5,1,5,PANUCCI,"Hey, Fry. Pizza goin' out. C'mon!"
5,1,5,FRY,But I'm celebrating New Years Eve.
5,1,5,PANUCCI,Like you got squat to celebrate! You're a delivery boy this millenium and you'll be a delivery boy next millenium! What's with Seymour? Its like he don't want you to go. Or he thinks your pants is too short or somethin'. Which is crazy 'cause frankly you look fabulous. Now get goin'!!
5,1,5,FRY,I won't be gone long Seymour. Just wait here 'til I come back.
5,1,6,FRY,Hello? Pizza delivery for......Icy Wiener?! Aw crud! I always thought at this point in my life I'd be the one making the crank calls! Here's to another lousy Millenium. What the?
5,1,6,BENDER,A dog collar for me? You shouldn't have!
5,1,6,FRY,That's for Seymour.
5,1,6,BENDER,Oh. Say why'd you get me a subscription to the Daily Growl? That's not a reputable journal of opinion.
5,1,6,FRY,Oh that's also for Seymour. I'm getting everything ready for when he's cloned.
5,1,6,BENDER,Are you on the jump Fry? Why are you wasting time on a creature of inferior intelligence?
5,1,6,FRY,Hey he was smart. He could fetch.
5,1,6,BENDER,I can fetch.
5,1,6,FRY,He could dig up bones.
5,1,6,BENDER,"Hello? Charlamange? Plus, I'll bet he couldn't create a laser show with his head."
5,1,6,FRY,"Look Bender, this has nothing to do with you."
5,1,6,BENDER,That's impossible!
5,1,6,FRY,Now if you'll excuse me I'm working on Seymour's doghouse.
5,1,6,BENDER,"No one ever asks if Bender would like to live in a tiny little house. Not that I would. A tiny little house that says ""Bender"" on it. Ow!"
5,1,6,FRY [ON ANSWERPHONE],"This is Fry. If you're calling about the used towels for sale, they're still available for $45 each."
5,1,6,MR FRY,"Phil, it's your father. Where are you? You're holding up New Years brunch. Your brother can't wait any longer."
5,1,6,YANCY,Hello first baloney of the new millenium! Ah here he comes. That's him and Seymour.
5,1,6,MRS FRY,Well that's odd. Seymour's here but - - Go! Go! Touchdown!! But where's Philip?
5,1,6,MR FRY,"I'm tellin' you the Y2K computer's got him. We'll face burnin' roads, rivers explodin' and calculators transformed into SCUD missiles. There's nothing we can do. What's that Seymour? You walking on sunshine?"
5,1,6,YANCY,He's trying to tell us something. Maybe he can lead us to Philip.
5,1,7,YANCY,Should we follow him?
5,1,7,MR FRY,To our deaths? Negatory.
5,1,8,MR FRY,It's the Y2K tryin' to lure us into an ambush. And I ain't buyin' it. Pass the baloney.
5,1,8,FRY,Are you two gonna be done soon?
5,1,8,LEELA,"Sorry, but we need to practice hand to hand combat in case an enemy knocks the laser gun out of our hands and they slide waaay across the room."
5,1,8,FRY,Well could you do it some place else? I'm setting up Seymour's doggy bed.
5,1,8,OK.,
5,1,8,BENDER,"Heel boy, heel! Oh hello Fry, I guess I didn't notice you there. I'm having such fun with my new best friend Robo-Puppy."
5,1,8,FRY (NOT CARING),That's nice.
5,1,8,BENDER,"I was just out walking him. Yes. You can walk him. Of course, after he goes you have to refill the canisters. C'mere boy! Pet, pet, pet."
5,1,8,ROBO-PUPPY,Robo-Puppy receiving petting.
5,1,8,AMY,"Bender, are you jealous of Fry's puppy? That's so adorable!"
5,1,8,BENDER,"Jealous? Hah! Not while I have the love of Robo-Puppy here. Robo-Puppy, lick my cheek."
5,1,8,ROBO-PUPPY,Robo-Puppy preparing to lick cheek. Robo-Puppy commencing cheek licking. Licking in progress. Licking complete.
5,1,8,BENDER,Robo-Puppy truly is robots best friend! Eh?
5,1,8,FRY,"Ah there, perfect!"
5,1,8,HOLO-FARNSWORTH,Good news everyone! The Clone-O-Mat is ready!
5,1,8,LEELA,Woohoo!
5,1,8,AMY,Yay!
5,1,8,FRY,Finally!
5,1,8,ROBO-PUPPY,Robo-Puppy commencing two hour yipping session. Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert! Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert!
5,1,8,FARNSWORTH,Behold once more the mighty Clone-O-Mat! Requiring such vast amounts of electricity that we must harness the elemental power of nature itself! I speak of course...of molten lava! Deep within the Earth's core. To the sub-basement!
5,1,9,FRY,Come on boy! Come back to life!
5,1,9,BENDER,"Fry c'mon, the talent show!"
5,1,9,FRY,What? I'm in the middle of something.
5,1,9,BENDER,"But, if we don't perform, in what sense do we have an act?"
5,1,9,FRY,"Bender, enough! Leave me alone!"
5,1,9,BENDER,So that's how it is huh? I thought you were my friend. But if you love your dog so much then maybe you'd rather play fetch!
5,1,9,LEELA,No!
5,1,9,ZOIDBERG,Oh!
5,1,9,BENDER,Now I'm all you got!
5,1,9,FRY,I hate you! I hate you! You evil metal man! Ow!
5,1,9,BENDER,So anyway your dog is melted. Now we're friends again.
5,1,9,FARNSWORTH,Not necessarily. For the dog may yet survive.
5,1,9,FRY,May yet? Really?
5,1,9,FARNSWORTH,"Indeed. You see, that fossil was made of dolomite. The tough black mineral that won't cop out when there's heat all about. By contrast, observe the lava's affect on this ice swan. Of course, that would have melted even at room temperature. I just wanted to get rid of it. But had it been made of that righteous mineral dolomite, there's a slim chance it might have survived."
5,1,9,FRY,So Seymour might still exist?
5,1,9,FARNSWORTH,Perhaps. For a few minutes. It's dolomite baby!
5,1,9,FRY,Then I'm goin' in after him.
5,1,9,AMY,No!
5,1,9,ZOIDBERG,Stop!
5,1,9,FRY,He'd come after me.
5,1,14,LEELA,Acting like a moron won't bring your dog back.
5,1,14,FRY,Then all hope is lost. Goodbye Seymour.
5,1,14,BENDER,Please stop crying Fry. Here. I assumed you were just pretending to love the dog. To toy with my emotions. Oh what have I done?
5,1,14,ZOIDBERG,You didn't do anything. Don't beat yourself up.
5,1,14,BENDER,"Fry, I'm sorry. I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature. Because I love you. Not in the way of the Ancient Greeks, but in the way a robot loves a human, a human loves a dog and occassionally, a gorilla loves a kitty. I'm goin' in!"
5,1,14,FARNSWORTH,I'm a professor! Why isn't anyone listening to me? You can't go in because you'll melt. The fossil only has a chance because it's made of dolomite!
5,1,14,BENDER,I'm 40% dolomite!
5,1,15,BENDER,"Oh it's hot, it's very hot!"
5,1,15,CRYOGENISIST,"Ugh, I am one hungover cryogenisist! Just throw that mutt in the freezer until his owners get here!"
5,1,15,MAN,You can't solve all your problems by freezing them boss.
5,1,15,CRYOGENISIST,I think you're forgetting our motto.
5,1,15,MR FRY,Are you the cryogenisist who called about our son's dog?
5,1,15,CRYOGENISIST,Oh you must be the Fry's. Yeah he's right over there.
5,1,15,MRS FRY,"Sorry we're late, we all got sick from eating bad baloney!"
5,1,15,Y2K!,
5,1,15,MRS FRY,What's he so worked up about?
5,1,15,MR FRY,He's just upset because our boy's missing. C'mon you overgrown rat. Lead us to Philip.
5,1,15,LEELA,Bender's been down there too long. I'm going in after him.
5,1,15,FARNSWORTH,Professor! Lava! Hot!
5,1,15,FRY,This is all my fault. I let my best friend risk his life just to get my dead dog back. Bender!!
5,1,15,BENDER,And that is why they call me Bender The Magnificent! Hey where'd everybody go?
5,1,15,BENDER,
5,1,15,FRY,Yeah!
5,1,15,FARNSWORTH,Very well. Let this abomination unto the Lord begin! Interesting. It seems Seymour died at the ripe old age of
5,1,15,FRY,15? You mean he lived for 12 more years after I got frozen?
5,1,15,FARNSWORTH,Indeed.
5,1,15,FRY,Stop the cloning.
5,1,15,FARNSWORTH,Oh sure! Smash the smart guy's machine!
5,1,15,BENDER,"Fry, what's wrong?"
5,1,15,FRY,Think about it. Seymour lived a full life after I was gone. He probably added new songs to his repertoire.
5,1,15,BENDER,But that's a good thing. Walking On Sunshine sucks noodles!
5,1,15,FRY,I had Seymour 'til he was three. That's when I knew him and that's when I loved him. I'll never forget him. But he forgot me a long long time ago.
