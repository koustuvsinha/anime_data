5,10,0,ZAPP [ON TV],Mmm!
5,10,0,NIXON [ON TV],"My fellow Earthicans. After meeting with top voodoo economists, I have decided to refund our silk surplus to you, the taxpayers. That's right! I've sent you each 300 buckeroos in the form of a tricky dick fun bill. Knock yourselves out!"
5,10,0,AMY,I'm slightly richer!
5,10,0,BENDER,What to do what to do? One $300 hookerbot or 300 $1 hookerbots?
5,10,0,LEELA,I'm going to swim with the whale! They're the gentle giants of the deep.
5,10,0,FARNSWORTH,I'm well aware of that.
5,10,0,SCRUFFY,Scruffy's gonna get himself one of them $300 haircuts. This ones lost it's pizazz!
5,10,0,ZOIDBERG,"A fortune it is! At last, Zoidberg will live like a rich man!"
5,10,0,NIXON [ON BILL],"Hey, cut it out! Go away! Get away from me!"
5,10,0,AMY,"Shmeesh! It's just 300 bucks, what is that, like a hundred cups of coffee?"
5,10,0,FRY,"That's it! I'm getting a hundred cups of coffee! Starting now. Coffee machine, one cup of coffee please."
5,10,0,NIXON [ON BILL],Smells good!
5,10,0,ZAPP [ON SCREEN],Leela? Are you there?
5,10,0,LEELA,No.
5,10,0,ZAPP [ON SCREEN],Oh yes you are! I'm hereby inviting you and your oddball co-workers to a special reception to display the national silk surplus. I believe you know the heroic space stallion who captured it. Show them my medal Kif.
5,10,0,KIF [ON SCREEN],He rented it with his tax refund.
5,10,0,ZAPP [ON SCREEN],"So Leela, will you have the pleasure."
5,10,0,LEELA,What little there is to be had.
5,10,0,ZAPP [ON SCREEN],Tomorrow night at eight them. Smoochies!
5,10,0,CRACK ADDICT,No cheap crack houses for me no more!
5,10,1,MAN,Very good sir. Shall I pre-warm sir's crack pipe?
5,10,2,AMY,"Oh Kif, it was so romantic of you to rent this peddle plane with your tax rebate. We're like two dandelion seeds wafting on the breeze."
5,10,2,KIF (GASPING),Yes...seeds...wafting.
5,10,2,AMY,I almost feel kinda shallow for blowing my rebate on this cool talking tattoo!
5,10,2,TATTOO,Hey Gordon Gecko! I cost as much as this whole crummy date!
5,10,2,AMY,Shut up! Ow!
5,10,2,FARNSWORTH,As a man it has become too much of a chore for me to clean out my wrinkles each day. Is it true that stem cells may fight the aging process?
5,10,2,GENEWORKS WOMAN,"Well yes, in the same way an infant may fight Muhammed Ali! But -"
5,10,2,FARNSWORTH,One pound of stem cells please.
5,10,2,GENEWORKS WOMAN,Of course any age reversing effects will be purely temporary.
5,10,2,BENDER,"Say buddy, why's this grand cigar so pricy?"
5,10,2,CLERK,"Well, as you can see, it's wrapper is a piece of the original US constitution. It was hand rolled by Queen Elizabeth during her wild years and was buried with George Burns until graverobbing space mushrooms - uh, well you know the rest."
5,10,2,BENDER,Give me 300 bucks worth!
5,10,2,CLERK,No can do.
5,10,2,BENDER,"Oh alright, I'll just take these $300 burglars tools then."
5,10,2,CLERK,Very good sir.
5,10,2,BENDER,"So uh, what time d'you close tonight?"
5,10,2,DWIGHT,Hey pops! Did that tax rebate come?
5,10,2,HERMES,Came and went! You're now the proud owner of Bamboo Boogie Boots! With a warning label this big you know they gotta be fun!
5,10,2,DWIGHT,"But pops, I don't wanna have fun, I wanna be like you. Boring but prudently invested."
5,10,2,HERMES,Babylon's bells! I tallyed almost 300 bananas on this entertainment product. Now you put 'em on and have fun!
5,10,2,DWIGHT (SHOUTING),I don't wanna.
5,10,2,HERMES,Well then I'm gonna put 'em on and make you watch me have fun! See? Fun! Fun! Dwight! Help me!
5,10,2,DWIGHT,I'll save you pops!
5,10,2,FARNSWORTH,Hey! Turn that damn music......up!
5,10,2,HERMES,Isn't this fun?
5,10,2,DWIGHT,No! I wish I had two mommies!
5,10,2,RANDY,"Try these, um, sir."
5,10,2,ZOIDBERG,I ask for rich guy stuff and you give me shiny pebbles? Bah! I bid you adieu!
5,10,2,RANDY,Ow!
5,10,2,LEELA,I'd like a pass to swim with Mushu please.
5,10,2,WHALE BIOLOGIST,Well you asked the right guy! I'm the whale biologist! Though personally I hate whales. Espeically Mushu.
5,10,2,LEELA,Then why'd you become a whale biologist?
5,10,2,WHALE BIOLOGIST,I don't know you well enough to get into that. $300 please. Noon tomorrow. If you're late you only get to tread water in the scallop tank.
5,10,3,FRY,"Uh, I'll have a coffee."
5,10,3,MAN,"Guppy, trout, mermaid or -"
5,10,3,FRY,Whale please.
5,10,3,KIF (GASPING),"Amy, I-I also spent some of my tax rebate on a gift for you."
5,10,3,AMY,Oh Kiffie!
5,10,3,KIF,It shows the time wherever we both are. And it's powered by love! Also you have to wind it.
5,10,3,TATTOO,Ohh! Somebody won big at Skeeball!
5,10,3,AMY,You shut up! I love it Kif. I'll use it whenever I wanna know what time it is. Ooo! It's Fry and Leela! Hi Fry and Leela!
5,10,3,KIF,Oh! Keep peddling! Oh for the love of God keep peddling!
5,10,5,AMY (SHOUTING),Bye Fry and Leela!
5,10,5,TATTOO,Oh I can't wait until the tattoos on Amy's butt hear about this!
5,10,5,BUTT TATTOOS,Hear about what? Tell us!
5,10,5,AMY,Don't feel sad my little tadpole.
5,10,5,KIF (CRYING),I'm trying not to. But my gift to you is in the belly of a whale.
5,10,5,ZOIDBERG,"Say, this reminds me of that time I ate that other watch Kif gave you!"
5,10,5,AMY,"Hey, it is kinda like that!"
5,10,5,ZOIDBERG,"To induce vomitting, that was the solution! Everywhere it went! What a Valentine's Day that was!"
5,10,5,LEELA,"Hmm, this may seem like a huge coincidence but I happen to have it in with that whale!"
5,10,5,SCRUFFY,Scruffy's formulated a plan. But you'll need a ready source of nausiatin' rotten fish.
5,10,5,ELZAR,Freshen your coffee sir?
5,10,5,FRY,Yeah yeah yeah keep it comin' put the pot down get away!
5,10,5,WOMAN,You're so young in spirit! Its hard to believe you're as old as 25.
5,10,5,FARNSWORTH,The key is to grab life by the hojos! Live every day like it might be your last!
5,10,5,ELZAR,What'll it be kids?
5,10,5,FARNSWORTH,One bowl of mild verena.
5,10,6,LEELA,Pay dirt! Heyya!
5,10,7,ELZAR,Here you go big spender: Foie gras and caviar!
5,10,7,ZOIDBERG,Goose liver? Fish eggs? Pah! Where's the goose? Where's the fish?
5,10,7,ELZAR,"Hey, that's what rich people eat. The garbage parts of the food."
5,10,7,ZOIDBERG,I ate garbage yesterday and it didn't cost me $300! I'm not paying. Farewell good sir!
5,10,8,BENDER,Le Grand Cigar! She's mine! And with absolutely no consequences!
5,10,9,SMITTY,You see that?
5,10,9,URL,Grand theft tobacco. Sounds like we should get off our fat cop asses and ride!
5,10,9,ELZAR,Pee-yew! This fish is slightly too rotten to even make jambolaya!
5,10,9,AMY (WHISPERING),So far so good. Where's Kif?
5,10,9,FRY (SHOUTING),This isn't Yemeni! It's Sulowesi! And the cup's shaking I don't want my coffee shaking!
5,10,9,BENDER,You seem a tad wound up buddy. And your face is greasy! Real greasy. You been up all night?
5,10,9,FRY,Of course I've been up all night! Not because of caffine it was insomnia I couldn't stop thinking about coffee I need a nap. Coffee time!
5,10,9,BENDER,Ah! Mighty fine smokable!
5,10,9,FRY,Fancy cigar why don't you smoke it already? Puff puff go go go go go!
5,10,9,BENDER,"Nah, you can't blow smoke from such a majestic stogy in just anyone's face. I'm saving it for the fancy pants at Zapp Brannigan's black tie reception. You comin'?"
5,10,9,WHALE BIOLOGIST,And the fifth reason whales kill is for the sheer fun of it.
5,10,9,LEELA,Anything else?
5,10,9,WHALE BIOLOGIST,"Yeah. You're lumpy and you smell awful. Hey, I calls 'em like I sees 'em! I'm a whale biologist."
5,10,9,LEELA,
5,10,9,WHALE BIOLOGIST,The suit was ugly - whale biologist!
5,10,9,CADDY,Perhaps if you tightened your grip sir?
5,10,9,ZOIDBERG,"Ah. Thank you golf slave! Bah! Rich pople wouldn't waste their time on this nonsense! Plus, these eggs are gritty and tasteless!"
5,10,10,FARNSWORTH,Ow! Not so rough!
5,10,10,WHALE BIOLOGIST,"Ladies and gentlemen, presenting Mushu! The educated whale who thinks he's better than you!"
5,10,10,AMY,C'mon Mushu! Barf! Barf like a freshman!
5,10,10,WHALE BIOLOGIST,"And now ignorant whale lovers, we'll see who's boss as I make Mushu jump through this hoop. Jump Mushu! Who wants a fish?"
5,10,10,LITTLE ORPHAN,Mushu is sick!
5,10,10,URL,It just keep comin' and comin'!
5,10,10,KIF,"Wait, that chunk, its the watch! I got it Amy! I got it! The plan went off without a -"
5,10,10,WHALE BIOLOGIST,He's got Aquarium property! Stop him!
5,10,10,URL,Better do what he says. He's a whale biologist!
5,10,10,SMITTY,You're under arrest you squishy punk!
5,10,11,ZAPP,"The Spiderians, though weak and woman-like on the battlefield, are masters of the textile arts. Taste like king crab by the way. Crazy bugs actually wove this tapestry of my heroic conquest while I was still killing them!"
5,10,11,ZOIDBERG,"What? It's not even scratch and sniff? But if rich people think it's good, I'll buy it! One art please!"
5,10,11,MOM,What a clever impersonation of a stupid poor person! How much is that placemat actually worth Brannigan?
5,10,11,ZAPP,Exactly $1 billion!
5,10,11,MOM,Now that's walkin' around money!
5,10,11,NIXON [ON BILL],What? Hey! Wait! Arooo!
5,10,11,WHITEY,"So I said to Kitty ""The only way to keep the butler from running away is to cut off his foot!"" Yes, it reminds me of a joke I heard about upper-middle class people."
5,10,11,AMY (CRYING),I've never been sad at a party before. I wonder if my mind is thinking about Kif being in jail.
5,10,11,SCRUFFY,Jail's not so bad. You can make sangria in the terlet! Course its shank or beshanked.
5,10,11,AMY (CRYING),Of course.
5,10,11,WHALE BIOLOGIST,"Look, just give back the property and we'll drop the charges."
5,10,11,KIF,"Fine, have the watch. It's broken anyway."
5,10,11,WHALE BIOLOGIST,I don't want your watch. You're covered in precious ambergris.
5,10,11,KIF,Precious ambergris?
5,10,11,HOLO-ROSEANNE,"Ambergris. Noun. A grease-like product of the sperm whale's digestive tract that is used as a base in the finest perfumes. This has been Roseanne, your guide to the world of facts."
5,10,11,WHALE BIOLOGIST,You heard Roseanne. Scrape off the priceless ambergris and I'll let you go!
5,10,11,KIF,Or better yet I'll simply shed my skin!
5,10,11,MORBO,Stop it! Stop it! It's fine! I will destroy you!
5,10,11,FARNSWORTH,"Wha? Uh, gotta go, uh fight club!"
5,10,11,WOMAN,What's happening Hubie?
5,10,11,FARNSWORTH,I'm afraid the face you fell in love with was actually just a blob of living gunk I bought with my tax refund.
5,10,11,WOMAN,"Well as long as we're being honest, I also spent my tax refund on a crazy treatment."
5,10,11,FARNSWORTH,That certainly is honest.
5,10,11,WOMAN,"It better for us both to just be ourselves. You, wrinkled as a prune."
5,10,11,FARNSWORTH,"You, fat as the Queen of Seacows."
5,10,11,WOMAN,I love you!
5,10,11,FARNSWORTH,Oh my!
5,10,11,KIF,So you see the putrid waxy substance I was coated with was -
5,10,11,AMY,Not precious ambergris?
5,10,11,KIF,"Yes! And I managed to sneak some out in a usual place! Ta-da! Using that, I'll make you a perfume of lilac and jasmine and frankenberry!"
5,10,11,AMY,"Oh Kif, it's so romantic I can't even wait! I'm gonna wear it right now!"
5,10,11,MOM,Who smells like freaking porpus hork?
5,10,11,AMY,I do! Kiss me Kif!
5,10,12,ZOIDBERG (CRYING),Oh what a foolish squid I've been. I'm not rich! I can't even buy one measley masterpiece!
5,10,12,HOBO #1,Pardon us gent. Might a couple of hungry hungry hobos take a feed from that aluminium snack box?
5,10,12,ZOIDBERG,So now I'm in the gutter? Surrounded by bums who eat garbage. Money brought me no happiness. Bupkiss!
5,10,12,HOBO #2,Ooo this boot's got a little pudding at the bottom!
5,10,12,BEELER,"Interestingly, the Spiderians are more closely related to our elephants than our spiders."
5,10,12,HERMES (SHOUTING),Don't mind us!
5,10,12,NIXON,The loot! The loot! The loot is on fire!
5,10,12,ZAPP,Leela! My precious rock tub! I'll save you!
5,10,12,KIF,Everyone! To the fire door!
5,10,12,LEELA,It's on fire!
5,10,12,FARNSWORTH,We're trapped my sweet hippopotamus!
5,10,12,FRY,Coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee!
5,10,13,DWIGHT,Where are we pops?
5,10,13,WOMAN,What happened to the food?
5,10,13,LEELA,I think we were saved by a mysterious orange blur.
5,10,13,ZOIDBERG,Welcome one and all. I finally figured out how money could make me happy! By using it to buy my hungry friends a feast!
5,10,13,HOBO #2,Everyone join us. Oysters rockafeller here has provided genuine turkey dogs!
5,10,13,WHITEY,"Heck, you're never too rich to enjoy a free turkey dog!"
5,10,13,WOMAN,I'll take four!
5,10,13,LEELA,Me too!
5,10,13,MOM,Oh what the hell!
5,10,13,HERMES,"Here Dwight, $299 and 99 cents. You invest this penny like you want it."
5,10,13,DWIGHT,Thanks Dad. I'm gonna take this and buy five shares of amazon.com!
5,10,13,HERMES,A risk taker? That's my boy!
5,10,13,NIXON,The entire surplus has gone! What a muguvern I've been! Why did I have to issue that crooked tax rebate?
5,10,13,LEELA,At least we got a few mildly interesting stories out of it.
5,10,13,FARNSWORTH,Oh my yes!
5,10,13,BENDER,"Speaking of which, my story kinda peetered out without me learning a lesson!"
5,10,13,SMITTY,There he is!
5,10,13,BENDER,All right! Closure!
