5,11,0,"""SPANISH FRY""","By Ron Weiner Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
5,11,0,FARNSWORTH,Oh Lord. Hiking is always such a strain on the buttocks.
5,11,0,FRY,Shh! What was that sound?
5,11,0,BENDER,"It wasn't a bird's nest falling. That sounds like this. Aww, they're so cute when they're scared!"
5,11,0,FRY,I meant the sound Bigfoot just made. He's been sighted a lot in this area recently. Just last week a blind hiker felt him!
5,11,0,FARNSWORTH,Don't tell me you actually believe in Bigfoot you blathering ninny-hammer!
5,11,0,FRY,"Of course I do! Bigfoot's my hero. Growing up, he was the celebrity I most identified with."
5,11,0,ZOIDBERG,Why?
5,11,0,FRY,'Cause he was a loner who hated the popular monsters yet longed to be one.
5,11,0,ZOIDBERG,I can so relate to that.
5,11,0,LEELA,"Ugh, enough emotions! This isn't a fat camp for God sake. Though you wouldn't know it from looking."
5,11,0,BENDER,Ahh!
5,11,0,ZOIDBERG,"Bender, if you want to sleep in the tent tonight, you're welcome to join me and Hermes for a little ""just friends"" spooning."
5,11,0,BENDER,"Nah, I'm comfy out here under the stars. Real comfy!"
5,11,0,RANGER PARK,Hey I'm Ranger Park the park ranger.
5,11,0,FRY,I get it!
5,11,0,RANGER PARK,Now since this area's a National Bigfoot Reserve we'll start with a short film about Bigfoot while I make a few phonecalls.
5,11,0,FRY,That proves it!
5,11,0,RANGER PARK,"It should say ""Top Quality Exercycle For Sale"" and could you put ""Top Quality"" in bold...? You can't? OK whatever."
5,11,0,RANGER PARK,
5,11,0,SAL,Yeah. Have yous ever seens Bigfeet?
5,11,0,RANGER PARK,Technically no. But I do see him each night in my dreams and each day in the silent faces of hairy children.
5,11,0,FARNSWORTH,Bunk! Bunk I say! Bring me a bag full of Bigfoot's droppings or shut up!
5,11,0,FARNSWORTH,Shut up!
5,11,0,BENDER,Oh my God its Bigfoot!
5,11,0,RANGER PARK,Where?
5,11,0,BENDER,Eh he's gone. He says you should keep wasting your life though.
5,11,0,PETUNIA,Oh! I saw Bigfoot crushing cars at the county fair!
5,11,0,RANGER PARK,What you saw was Bigfoot the monster truck. But thanks for a great question.
5,11,0,PETUNIA,Ohh...
5,11,0,FRY,"Sir, if I may, why don't you set up like a billion video cameras in the woods and see if he walks by one."
5,11,0,RANGER PARK,"Ah, that would be very expensive. And most people who believe in Bigfoot are broke."
5,11,0,BENDER,Hey look! Bigfoot! He's back!
5,11,0,RANGER PARK,Where?
5,11,0,BENDER,Up your face! Everybody do the Bender!
5,11,0,AMY,The sky out here is amazing. Look at all those satellites.
5,11,0,FARNSWORTH,Goodnight employess.
5,11,0,HERMES,Goodnight.
5,11,0,ZOIDBERG,Goodnight Hubert.
5,11,0,FRY,You doin' alright out there buddy?
5,11,0,BENDER,Better than these gnats! That guy won't be goin' home to his kids!
5,11,0,BENDER,"Who's that? A wolf? Or some kind of boogen? Oh God I wish I was safe inside a tent. Fry, Fry wake up! It's me! Bigface!"
5,11,2,FRY,Bigfoot? Bigfoot?
5,11,3,FRY,"Bigfoot? Is that you? I'm not like the others Bigfoot. I see through your monster coatings to the gentle loner inside. I bet you have a wounded racoon friend that you tenderly nurse back to health and go......and in the end they shoot you. But you teach us about things. Oh, it's a flying saucer. Excuse me? You can't park here. The parking area's over there. Wow nice tube! Hey. Hey what's the big idea? Stop abducting me. Why does your vanity plate say ""Probe 1""?"
5,11,3,LEELA,"There's nothing so refreshing as the clean, crisp taste of old Canadian beer!"
5,11,3,HERMES,"Well, see you in an hour. I gotta go do some business behind that tree."
5,11,3,AMY,"Bender, wasn't that Fry's tent?"
5,11,3,LEELA,"Bender raises a good point, where is Fry?"
5,11,5,FRY,"Amy, you won't believe what happened......it was so scary that you wouldn't - I know but listen it gets even scarier."
5,11,5,FARNSWORTH,Fry! What in Sega Genesis happened to you?
5,11,5,FRY,That's what I'm trying to tell you. See - Why are you all staring at me like that? Is there something on my face?
5,11,5,HERMES,Uh...no.
5,11,5,LEELA,Someone should tell him.
5,11,5,FRY,Tell me what?
5,11,5,LEELA,Nothing.
5,11,5,ZOIDBERG,"Well I have a lot of experience telling patients bad news so, let me break it to him gently. Fry you have no nose! Your nose is gone! You have no nose on your face! Where it is I can't say but on your face it's not!"
5,11,5,FRY,What?
5,11,5,BENDER,"Aww, I think it's sweet! You chopped off your nose so you could look more like your hero. Me, Bender!"
5,11,5,FARNSWORTH,Which last night?
5,11,5,FRY,"In the woods, I was walking. For Bigfoot, looking and then aliens beamed me up."
5,11,5,AMY,Were they little grey dudes with big oval heads? I don't get that gesture. Am I wrong?
5,11,5,ZOIDBERG,Cheer up friend. When we get home a high quality prosthesis will have you looking good as new.
5,11,5,FRY,I'm a pathetic freak. My life is ruined.
5,11,5,HERMES,"Man, you are such a jokester!"
5,11,5,FRY,I'll never have another moment of happiness.
5,11,5,LEELA,I know you're trying to mask your pain with humour but don't worry. I'm sure the Professor can clone you a new nose.
5,11,5,FARNSWORTH,Well there's no sense fretting. Good Lord you're ugly! The fact is your nose is gone and we'll never find out who did it or why.
5,11,5,BENDER,"Guys, guys! There's something on television."
5,11,5,LINDA [ON TV],"Alien abductions: Until now, a harmless nuisance. But recently they've taken on a sinister dimension as unsuspecting victims are returned...without noses!"
5,11,5,FRY,Like me!
5,11,5,MORBO [ON TV],"The culprits: Shameless poachers, hunting humans without a permit."
5,11,5,LINDA [ON TV],"The valuable nose or ""human horn"" fetches a high price on alien worlds as an aphrodisiac."
5,11,5,FRY,My nose is an aphrodisiac? I'm gonna drop a barf!
5,11,5,MORBO [ON TV],Demand for human horn is great. Due in part to titilating scenes from depraved alien TV programmes too filthy for Earth broadcast. Let's watch.
5,11,5,FRY,Blech! We have to track down my nose before some alien snarfs it and does the worm. Who's in?
5,11,5,LEELA,Me and Bender and maybe Zoidberg if he feels like it.
5,11,5,ZOIDBERG,No I'm good.
5,11,6,ALIEN,"Lets see, I'll have a pancreas, two sphincters and a large colon."
5,11,6,FRY,"It's no use. We've been to ever scuzzy bazaar in the galaxy, including Pottery Barn."
5,11,6,LEELA,"Wait, what's that?"
5,11,7,SALESMAN,Welcome friends. How may I pervert you?
5,11,7,FRY,"Uh, I'm looking for human horn."
5,11,7,SALESMAN,Shh! You're not cops right?
5,11,7,LEELA,Of course not. In fact he's a crook.
5,11,7,BENDER,Yep. Stolen Pez anyone?
5,11,7,SALESMAN,Right this way.
5,11,7,SALESMAN,Human horn. So fresh you can still see the eyeglass marks.
5,11,7,FRY,"Nope, uh-uh, eww! Now look, this is the nose we want. Did you sell it to somebody?"
5,11,7,SALESMAN,"I'm sorry sir but due to the perverted nature of our business, customer records are strictly confidential. Right this way."
5,11,8,SALESMAN,"I video tape everyone who comes in here so I can blackmail them later. Hey, I'm a porno dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Here's the weirdo who bought your horn."
5,11,8,LEELA,That's Lrrr! Ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8!
5,11,8,LRRR [ON TV],"You got any uh, you know..."
5,11,8,SALESMAN [ON TV],Speak up! You're muttering!
5,11,8,LRRR [ON TV],I said uh... human horn?
5,11,8,LRRR [ON TV],"Oh no no, I'm just some guy. Ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8!"
5,11,8,LRRR,"So let me get this straight: If I buy eight caramello bars, you all get to go to some camp."
5,11,8,BENDER,Yep. That's exactly the lie we used to get past your guards.
5,11,8,FRY,Oh great space king. I humbly beg you to return my human horn.
5,11,8,LRRR,"Uh, human horn? How ridiculous! Why would virile male like Lrrr need human horn? I don't even know what it's for. What is it, something you-you put in salad dressing?"
5,11,8,ND-ND,Like you've ever seen a salad.
5,11,8,LRRR,My weight is appropriate and attractive!
5,11,8,LEELA,"Whoa, you guys have issues!"
5,11,8,LRRR,"She has issues! I'm fine! But there's no human horn around here so, make friends with the door."
5,11,8,FRY,Alright. I give up. I guess I'll just go home and marry a skunk.
5,11,8,ND-ND,Oh let's just give it to him. Here.
5,11,8,FRY,My nose! Light of my face!
5,11,8,LRRR,"Uh, what is that? How do you have that Nd-Nd? I've never seen it before. My friend left it here."
5,11,8,LEELA,Hold still Fry. I can reattach it with my emergency face laser.
5,11,8,FRY,Hey! You burned my cheek!
5,11,8,LEELA,Yeah sorry I wasn't really concentrating.
5,11,8,FRY,"No I mean the singed flesh, I can smell it! Those lilacs on the table."
5,11,8,LRRR,At least someone noticed.
5,11,8,ND-ND,For the last time I don't like lilacs! Your first wife was the one who liked lilacs.
5,11,8,LRRR,She also liked to shut up!
5,11,8,FRY,"Well, great seeing you, I guess we'll be on our -"
5,11,8,BENDER,"Yo, highness! Uh, just out of robo-curiosity, why would you use a guy's nose for an aphrodisiac instead of his...you know...wing dang doodle?"
5,11,8,LRRR,But I thought the horn was the human wing dang doodle?
5,11,8,BENDER,"No sir-chee! The main event, so to speak, is downstairs near the wallet. Ever seen soccer players line up to block a free kick? They ain't covering their noses I'll say that much! Well, seeya!"
5,11,8,LRRR,Interesting. The trousers conceal a tiny secondary horn.
5,11,8,FRY,"Hey, what've you heard?"
5,11,8,LRRR,Guards! Seize him! Prepare to harvest the lower horn!
5,11,8,FRY,
5,11,8,LRRR,Guards!
5,11,8,GUARD #1,Yeah?
5,11,8,LRRR,Remove the human's lower horn and prepare it to be eaten by me.
5,11,8,ND-ND,In other words slop a lot of ketchup and salt on it!
5,11,8,LRRR,Then bring it to our royal bedchamber and put it in the sock drawer with all the other things that have failed to arouse my passion for this woman.
5,11,8,GUARD #2,Remove pants!
5,11,8,FRY,Wait! I'm usually the first guy to toot my own lower horn -
5,11,8,BENDER,I'll say!
5,11,8,FRY,But in this case I just don't think it'll do any good.
5,11,8,BENDER,That's what she said!
5,11,8,LEELA,Let's face it. You two have deep relationship problems that can't be solved by an aphrodisiac.
5,11,8,FRY,However huge it might be.
5,11,8,ND-ND,"So what do you suggest, painfully single human?"
5,11,8,LEELA,"Well, why don't you think back to what brought you together in the first place?"
5,11,8,ND-ND,Ohh I don't know. Lrrr used to be so tender.
5,11,8,LRRR,I only wrote that poem to test my printer.
5,11,8,ND-ND,We'd go walking in the woods and Lrrr would find injured little tinkle-bunnies and nurse them back to health.
5,11,8,LRRR,Yes but I'm the one who injured them!
5,11,8,ND-ND,Oh shush. You stepped on them by accident and then you cried all night. That's the kind of sensitive man you used to be.
5,11,8,LRRR,And you used to wear a size-3 cape. But not anymore! Now bring me that lower horn while I'm still in the mood.
5,11,8,FRY,Wh-What if we helped you get your passion back without the hassle of mutilating me?
5,11,8,LEELA,"Yeah, we know a great place in the mountains. We could take you there for a romantic dinner under the stars."
5,11,8,ND-ND,"Hmm, sounds interesting. But he would never do it."
5,11,8,LRRR,Like hell I wouldn't. I'm not gonna be blamed for not going!
5,11,8,FRY,Then it's a deal. We get one night. I keep my horn as long as you two end up doing the horizontal monster mash.
5,11,8,BENDER,I don't get it!
5,11,8,BENDER,Bonjour. May I offer you a box of wine for the edge of the table?
5,11,8,LRRR,No thanks. Just water please. Tap water!
5,11,8,ND-ND,Oh big spender!
5,11,8,LRRR,"That's it, this date is over! Waiter!"
5,11,8,FRY,"So, what can I get you this evening?"
5,11,8,LRRR,Your lower horn!
5,11,8,FRY,"I'll just start you off with some bread. Some sexy, arousing bread!"
5,11,8,LRRR,Fine but none of that whole-grain goat food! And bring plenty of melted butter.
5,11,8,ND-ND,Why don't you just inject some fat straight into your ass and cut out the middle man!
5,11,8,LRRR,"One of these days Nd-Nd, bang, zoom, straight to the third moon of Omicron Persei 8!"
5,11,8,LRRR [EATING],"Mmm, this jerked chicken is good! I think I'll have Fry's lower horn jerked."
5,11,8,BENDER,It's used to it!
5,11,8,FRY,"So uh, how are you two sneaky poopums doing?"
5,11,8,ND-ND,Poorly.
5,11,8,LRRR,My wife is right for once. There is very little magic in the air. Ready the lower horn transport vessel.
5,11,8,BENDER,"Boy, who knew a cooler could also make a handy wang coffin? Hey, uh mind if I stick these in here?"
5,11,8,GUARD #1,Go for it.
5,11,8,LEELA,Don't worry Fry. Things look bad but I still have a trump card. The most beautiful love song ever written. And I will always love you......will always love you...
5,11,8,ND-ND,The humans are attacking.
5,11,8,LRRR,Pluck the lower horn and let's get out of here!
5,11,8,BENDER,"Quick Fry, run for it!"
5,11,8,FRY,"Come on freedom cage! Roll me to safety! Yes! I never thought I'd escape with my doodle, but I pulled it out!"
5,11,8,BENDER,Just like at the movie theatre!
5,11,8,LRRR,Give me that!
5,11,8,FRY,Bigfoot! He's real! I knew it. The Loch Ness Monster's book was right!
5,11,8,LRRR,"Well, hello there my furry friend."
5,11,8,ND-ND,Look at his adorable little feet. Yes you are a cutie-pie.
5,11,8,RANGER PARK,Holy macaroni! I can't believe I'm seeing Bigfoot! He's in focus! Oh I've waited my entire life for this moment!
5,11,8,BENDER,What are you doing with that?
5,11,8,LRRR,You're going to kill this innocent giganto?
5,11,8,RANGER PARK,Of course not. I'm just gonna tranquilise him so I can chop off his feet as proof he exists. Then dump him back in the wild. He'll do fine.
5,11,8,LRRR,You'll have to get through me first.
5,11,8,RANGER PARK,
5,11,8,LRRR,Now leave this gentle sasquatch - or wood ape - in peace so I can finally and at long last harvest this pathetic human's lower horn.
5,11,8,FRY,Yeah!
5,11,8,LRRR,"Wait. What am I saying? If I poach this beast's lower horn, am I any better than that ranger with his demented foot lust? Yes. But not by enough."
5,11,8,RANGER PARK,Score!
5,11,8,LRRR,"This human's lower horn is one of God's creatures, a living thing. And all living things, large and small..."
5,11,8,BENDER,"In this case ""small""!"
5,11,8,LRRR,...have diginity. And a spark of divine.
5,11,8,ND-ND,That's the gentle sensitive poet warlord I fell in love with!
5,11,8,LRRR,"Uh, you'll wanna retreat to a safe, 500 metre radius!"
5,11,8,LEELA,"Well Fry, it looks like you get to hold onto your lower horn."
5,11,8,BENDER,As usual! Run away!
5,11,8,SCIENTIST [ON TV],"I have combined the DNA of the world's most evil animals, to make the most evil creature of them all."
5,11,8,MAN [ON TV],It turns out it's Man.
