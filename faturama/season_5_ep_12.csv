5,12,0,"""BEND HER""","By Mike Rowe Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
5,12,1,FRY,So who should I root for? America or one of those countries I learned about at the Food Court?
5,12,1,AMY,How 'bout those guys?
5,12,1,LEELA,"No, they're from the Republic Of French Stereotypes. Everybody hates them."
5,12,1,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, let's go check on Hermes. All this inspiring multi-culturalism is angrying up my blood. Sweden? I don't think so!"
5,12,1,HERMES,"Go on stick, touch me! Can't do it!"
5,12,1,LABARBARA,"Husband, you haven't been an Olympic class limboer for 20 years! Quit lying to your podgy self."
5,12,1,LEELA,It does seem like Jamaica will be able to field a strong limbo team without you.
5,12,1,AMY,"Yeah, isn't that basically all Jamaicans do?"
5,12,1,HERMES,Jamaicans have other interests. Which is why the limbo team got detained at the airport.
5,12,1,LABARBARA,That's when they begged my husband to step in and make an ass out of himself.
5,12,1,HERMES,And I said I'd try my very best.
5,12,1,FRY,"But have they seen your...y'know...physique, since the old days?"
5,12,1,HERMES,"I described it to them on the phone, using a series of artful euphanisms."
5,12,1,FARNSWORTH,"Don't worry, the fat pig will do fine thanks to this flabbo-dynamic spandex bodysuit I've designed. It redistributes his weight, shifting his centre of gravity closer to his knees."
5,12,1,HERMES,"Ooo, that's snug! Oh, those haven't descended in years."
5,12,1,FARNSWORTH,Now that's a limboer's body!
5,12,1,LABARBARA,You're that fine Jamaican bacon!
5,12,1,BENDER,"Shut up Zoidberg, the robot bending events are starting! Something tells me I could easily beat those trained professionals."
5,12,5,BENDER,"Wow, that guy must have to be like the world's greatest bender. My dreams of glory died before they began."
5,12,5,ZOIDBERG,Welcome to my life!
5,12,6,BARBADOS SLIM,Hermes Conrad. Is that you inside that dumpy little fat man?
5,12,6,HERMES,Barbados Slim! What are you doing here? Last time I heard you were in Barbados.
5,12,6,BARBADOS SLIM,Yes and I'll be going back there with a gold medal draped around my elegant Carribean shoulders.
5,12,6,HERMES,"Your body may be as perfectly scultpted as it was 20 years ago when you whupped my fat ass every time we met......but today, I feel lucky."
5,12,6,BARBADOS SLIM,I see you're still able to limbo under the bar of fashion sense!
5,12,6,HERMES,"That's it Barbados Slim, you've gone one talk over the line!"
5,12,6,STARTER,"Limboers, on your marks, get rubbery......limbo!"
5,12,6,COMMENTATOR,"There they go, and Barbados Slim takes an early lead. God I hope he wins. What's this? Hermes Conrad is closing the gap. He's limboed out of retirement and straight into my heart. I say go to hell Barbados Slim!"
5,12,7,FARNSWORTH,"Go bodysuit, go!"
5,12,7,ZOIDBERG,Go!
5,12,7,BENDER,C'mon!
5,12,7,LABARBARA,"C'mon Hermes, beat that mahogany god!"
5,12,8,COMMENTATOR,"It's Barbados, then Conrad. Conrad pulls ahead! And Conrad is disqualified! Barbados Slim, my hero, takes the gold!"
5,12,8,LABARBARA,"Aww, there there Hermes. You did your best! If I'd wanted a human Adonis for a husband, I'd have stayed married to Barbados Slim."
5,12,9,BENDER,"Well enough about Hermes, I couldn't win a medal either. Even at bending - the thing I was built to do. I'm so embarassed. I wish everybody else was dead."
5,12,9,FEMALE ANNOUNCER,"Up next, the Fembot bending competition."
5,12,9,BENDER,"Fembots? Methinks a clever Manbot suitably disguised might win those events! But the charade would require subtlety, nuance, grace."
5,12,9,BENDER,"What do you mean I'm not registered? My name is Coilette and I'm from, uh...Robonia! Coilette's a chick's name!"
5,12,9,OFFICIAL,"Yes but ""Robonia"" sounds like something somebody made up on the spot."
5,12,9,BENDER,Ever been beaten up by a guy dressed like a chick?
5,12,9,MALE ANNOUNCER,And it's straight! Coilette wins!
5,12,9,MALE ANNOUNCER,Another gold medal for the spunky maid from Robonia.
5,12,9,MALE ANNOUNCER,"A perfect bend and a flawless entry. No splash at all! Perfect scores, a record five gold medals for Coilette!"
5,12,9,BENDER,"I'm great! Everybody else sucks, except that guy Bender, he's really somethin'!"
5,12,9,LEELA,You actually thought they'd let you walk away without an engine oil sex check?
5,12,9,BENDER,"Oh God, I'm not gonna get my medals! They're all I have to remember my Olympic career. Wait, I've got it! Professor, make a woman out of me!"
5,12,9,FARNSWORTH,Oh I think we should just stay friends.
5,12,9,BENDER,"I don't need friends, I need a sex change operation and give it to me now!"
5,12,9,FARNSWORTH,Bender a robot sex change is a complex and dangerous procedure. Replacing your testosteroil with Fembot lubricants can cause wild mood swings. And the effects may be irreversible. Well let's get started!
5,12,9,LEELA,"No, you can't!"
5,12,9,AMY,If you have even the slightest respect for the dignity of women -
5,12,9,BENDER,Pfft.
5,12,9,FARNSWORTH,"I'm sorry ladies but I must do this. Not for you, not for Bender, but for the proud people of Robonia!"
5,12,9,BENDER,C'mon!
5,12,10,FRY,I can't watch this 'cause it's creepy and wrong and sick. However I will watch out of curiosity.
5,12,10,FARNSWORTH,Quiet! I'm about to begin the process of reshaping Bender's body into a tender delicate form.
5,12,10,FARNSWORTH,Draining male oil. Infusing female oil. Removing item.
5,12,10,ROBOT,We can't wait for Coilette any longer dammit. I have to get home to watch The Zombie Osbournes.
5,12,10,COILETTE,I'm ready for my test now boys.
5,12,10,COILETTE,"Hail, hail Robonia, a land I didn't make up!"
5,12,10,COILETTE [ON TV],Ooo yeah c'mon baby boom!
5,12,10,COILETTE,Oh yeah baby c'mon! Work your can! That's it shake it out!
5,12,10,LEELA,"I don't know which I'm more, enraged or disgusted!"
5,12,10,COILETTE,I'm just out there making us ladies look good.
5,12,10,AMY,Snuh-uh! You're making us look like jerks in front of the other genders.
5,12,10,FRY,But you're not really a lady anyway. Right?
5,12,10,COILETTE,Of course not.
5,12,10,FARNSWORTH,"Dear Lord, a coaster! The Femzoil must be sacheting girlishly into your processor."
5,12,10,COILETTE,Then change me back. My breasts are keeping me awake at night anyway. Hello...? What...? A guest spot on Late Night With Humorbot 5.0...? I'd love to! My own limo...? No I don't have my own limo. You'd better send one. I need a raincheck on that nad-swap Professor. I'm going on TV. C'mon Fry help me pick out a pantsuit!
5,12,10,HUMORBOT 5.0,"So Calculon, do you want to set up this clip from All My Circuits?"
5,12,10,CALCULON,No I think it's self-explanatory.
5,12,10,CALCULON,"Funny story, the script called for me to say ""yes"" but I gave it a little twist."
5,12,10,HUMOUBOT 5.0,"Anecdote accepted. Snappy comeback not found. Please put your hands together for my next guest. Winner of five Olympic medals - Coilette from Robonia. So Coilette, many young Fembot's wish to emulate you. Any advice for them?"
5,12,10,COILETTE,"Yes Humorbot. If you ask me, women today are too stuck up to go out and jiggle their jello like everybody wants them to. In fact, should I do it now? Alright then! Woo! Look out baby! Work it out! Oo shake that thing! You gotta use it lady! Shake it up a little! Look at that! C'mon! Work it out!"
5,12,10,CALCULON,"Madam, I am one impressed celebrity."
5,12,10,COILETTE,Oh I bet you say that to all the five Olympic gold medal winning Fembots!
5,12,10,CALCULON,From this day forward I shall do so whenever possible.
5,12,10,COILETTE,Golly...what?
5,12,10,CALCULON,Coilette this may be presumtuous....
5,12,10,COILETTE,That's my favourite kind of this!
5,12,10,CALCULON,...but I would be honoured if you would join me for dinner sometime.
5,12,10,COILETTE,Calculon. You'd be fulfilling this naive Robonian farmgirl's fantasy!
5,12,10,CALCULON,Of course I would.
5,12,10,COILETTE,This top makes me look fat. Is it trampy to go on a first date nude?
5,12,10,AMY,Yes.
5,12,10,COILETTE,Perfect.
5,12,10,FRY,You gotta tell me. You're not actually attracted to Calculon right? And if you are don't tell me. Are you?
5,12,10,COILETTE,Certainly not. But just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Is that so much to ask?
5,12,10,LEELA,Well I think you dating a Manbot is a disgrace. And I refuse to be involved. And you have way too much lipstick on.
5,12,10,COILETTE,Are you kidding? I need more lipstick! Much more! Ooo yeah that's the stuff! Men love it when you really glob it on!
5,12,10,LEELA,No they don't.
5,12,10,AMY,No way!
5,12,10,COILETTE,"Oh please. Every man wants a tramp! No wonder you girls aren't married! I tell you, men are so much better at being women."
5,12,10,FRY,"But what if he wants to, I mean if he tries to...uh...Barry White?"
5,12,10,COILETTE,I'll just tell him I needed commitment first. That'll stick a potato in his tailpipe!
5,12,10,HERMES,Good Lord man what kind of temporary woman are you?
5,12,10,COILETTE,"Look, why don't all of you just back off? Can't a girl enjoy herself without being judged?"
5,12,10,FARNSWORTH,"Oh dear. Her mood swings are getting wilder. She's becoming a slave to her emotions. Just like all women, particularly you Leela."
5,12,10,LEELA,I'm worried about him too Professor.
5,12,10,ELZAR,"Hey ma'am, you sure can put it away! You saved me a trip to the dump! Bam!"
5,12,10,CALCULON,I'd appreciate it if you didn't bam the young lady.
5,12,10,ELZAR,"Well, I'd appreciate it if I did, so I guess we're even."
5,12,10,CALCULON,"You know Coilette, I've never before met a woman as fascinating as I am. You're such a sweet, soft Fembot. And you have this free spirit about you. And there it is. It's as if you understand the male mind better than I! I've never met anyone like you."
5,12,10,COILETTE,Oh yes you have.
5,12,10,CALCULON,Coilette. I'd like to spend some quality time with you.
5,12,10,COILETTE,"What? Ahh! Whoa, no way! Not gonna happen. What kind of girl do you think I am?"
5,12,10,CALCULON,Have I mentioned that I own the world's biggest and most elegant yacht?
5,12,10,COILETTE,Woo! I'm a trophy girlfriend!
5,12,10,AMY,No kidding. These gifts have been coming non-stop! I think Calculon's falling for you.
5,12,10,COILETTE,Bah. Any day now he'll dump me for a new wad of arm candy. And then I can turn back into a guy and hock all this stuff! It's just a game.
5,12,10,CALCULON,"Coilette, I can't stop thinking about you. I can't sleep at night - although as a robot I don't do that anyway. But if I did I couldn't because I love you so. Oh my darling......Will you marry me?"
5,12,10,COILETTE,"Oh Calculon, yes I will!"
5,12,10,AMY,Maybe she's right about the lipstick.
5,12,10,FRY,I'll miss you buddy. You've been like a brother and then a sister to me. And now you're getting married. I love you.
5,12,10,COILETTE,The marriage is a scam.
5,12,10,FRY,Cool. What's for dinner?
5,12,10,LEELA,What do you mean a scam?
5,12,10,COILETTE,"I marry Calculon, divorce him, take half his money and turn back into a guy. It's sort of a two-person pyramid scheme."
5,12,10,FRY,That's marriage alright!
5,12,10,LEELA,That is so unbelievably manipulative.
5,12,10,COILETTE,"Come on, you never went on a date with a guy just 'cause you were hungry?"
5,12,10,LEELA,Well I...uh...I thought I might like him on a full stomach.
5,12,10,COILETTE,"Nice try sister. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to meet with my wedding planner. Zoidberg. Zoidypoo, please tell me frilly is in this year."
5,12,10,ZOIDBERG,I saw a frilly cake in here you would remember all your life. I know I will. Late at night it haunts me with it's frosted beauty. Order the cake dammit!
5,12,10,CALCULON,I have something for you.
5,12,10,COILETTE,A remote control? You got me a TV?
5,12,10,CALCULON,"No my dearest, it's the remote control to my heart! It symbolises the power you have to sway my emotions."
5,12,10,COILETTE,Will it work on my TV?
5,12,10,CALCULON,"We don't need TVs, we have each other! Coilette if I weren't able to spend my life with you I would leap from this very balloon."
5,12,10,COILETTE,Come on now - really?
5,12,10,CALCULON,Yes! We were meant to be!
5,12,10,COILETTE,So...you really and truly love me?
5,12,10,CALCULON,So much so that I'm prepared to give up showbusiness itself to be with you!
5,12,10,COILETTE,"But, you always said you'd rather burn down a convent than give up showbusiness."
5,12,10,CALCULON,I always said many things. But now all I want is a peaceful life and a quiet villa overlooking a vineyard....with you.
5,12,10,COILETTE,Would we have donkeys?
5,12,10,CALCULON,All you can eat!
5,12,10,COILETTE,Oh take me in your arms and compress me. Compress me tight!
5,12,10,CALCULON,Stop! Let us climb to the heavens that the gods themselves might embrace!
5,12,10,COILETTE,I just don't think I can go through with this scam.
5,12,10,AMY,What?
5,12,10,FRY,So now you do wanna marry him?
5,12,10,COILETTE,"No, I just don't wanna hurt him, or humiliate him. Oh, curse this woman's heart!"
5,12,10,FRY,Eck!
5,12,10,FARNSWORTH,You're falling into the final debilitating stages of womanhood. You've waited too long to switch back you dingbat!
5,12,10,LEELA,
5,12,10,COILETTE,Uh-huh.
5,12,10,LEELA,"Alright. Now there's no way to stop this marriage without hurting Calculon. But he's an actor. If there's one kind of pain he can handle, it's soap opera pain."
5,12,10,LEELA,
5,12,10,FRY,Yep.
5,12,10,AMY,Uh-huh.
5,12,10,HERMES,Check!
5,12,10,ZOIDBERG,Impassively.
5,12,10,PREACHERBOT,"Dearly beloved actors and casting people who may be looking for somebody to play a preacher, I welcome you! The bride has written some vows that we will now all pretend to be interested in."
5,12,10,COILETTE,Dearest Calculon. Forever is not enough time to tell you of the many ways I love you.
5,12,10,HEDONISMBOT,Oh my!
5,12,10,CALCULON,Is there a doctor in the -
5,12,10,ZOIDBERG,I came as soon as I could. It appears to be a case of African Hydraulic Fever!
5,12,10,CALCULON,"Dear God! The very illness my TV character caught in season two, when I was holding out for more money! It's often fatal."
5,12,10,COILETTE,"Whatever happens, remember, the flame of my eternal love will burn forever."
5,12,10,CALCULON,"Of course. But smoochiepups, I thought one could only catch hydraulic fever deep in the diamond mines of the Congo."
5,12,10,LEELA,Coilette! You she-devil! You really thought you could steal those diamonds from me and Congo Jack?
5,12,10,COILETTE,Those gems belong to the natives!
5,12,10,CALCULON,Oh how cruel and melodramatic fate is. Whhhy?
5,12,10,COILETTE,"Calculon, my darling, your loud ""why"" brought me partway back to life. Congo Jack!"
5,12,10,CALCULON,Another shocking twist!
5,12,10,FRY,Yes. And I have a message for you from Colonel Mitumba! He says this......is from Congo Jack.
5,12,10,COILETTE,"Uh, um..."
5,12,10,CALCULON,No! Nooo! N-O-O-O!
5,12,10,COILETTE,I won't leave you. Not until I'm sure you understand the thing I said before. About my eternal love for you burning......et cetera.
5,12,10,CALCULON,I do. I do.
5,12,10,COILETTE,
5,12,10,ZOIDBERG [EATING],"I'm a doctor, she's dead."
5,12,10,CALCULON,"She lives no more. But let us all find comfort knowing that she truly loved me. To honour my pain, I shall star in a film dedicated to her memory. And this time the Academy will not deny me. Not when they see Coilette: A Calculon Story."
5,12,10,CALCULON [ON TV],"Coilette. Your death fills me wih sorrow, anger, fear, every emotion an actor can display."
5,12,10,FARNSWORTH,Turn off that crap-o-rama! One mistake now and Bender will be trapped forever between the already ill-defined robot sexes.
5,12,10,COILETTE,"Ow, oo, ow."
5,12,10,FRY,"Well Bender, I hope this has taught you a lesson about changing your sex to win five gold medals."
5,12,10,COILETTE,It truly has. My romance with Calculon has shown me a lot about myself.
5,12,10,FARNSWORTH,Almost done.
5,12,10,COILETTE,"If only somehow, someway he and I could..."
5,12,10,BENDER,"...drive to Vegas, pick up some Flooziebots and void their warranties all night long!"
5,12,10,FRY,Yay my buddy's home! And his respect for women is back to normal.
5,12,10,LEELA,I kind of hope this whole experience would have left you a little more open to your sensitive side.
5,12,10,BENDER,Yeah you'd think but what you gonna do?
5,12,10,CALCULON [ON TV],"Coilette, the skies themselves weep upon the sweetest flower of all the field."
5,12,10,LEELA,Aww!
5,12,10,AMY,Aww!
5,12,10,FRY,Eww!
5,12,10,ZOIDBERG,Gross.
5,12,10,FARNSWORTH,Sentimental drivel-poop.
5,12,10,FRY,C'mon Bender let's go. This chick flick is getting me all barfy.
5,12,10,BENDER,Yeah. Emotions are dumb and should be hated.
5,12,10,CALCULON [ON TV],"Goodnight Coilette, my turtledove."
5,12,10,BENDER,Goodnight Calculon.
5,12,10,LEELA,What did you say?
5,12,10,BENDER,I said you two don't dress trampy enough. I still got it!
