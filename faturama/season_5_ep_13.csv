5,13,0,"""OBSOLETELY FABULOUS""","By Dan Vebber Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
5,13,1,MAN,$10 please.
5,13,1,FRY,Aw man!
5,13,1,NANNYBOT 1.0,Sleep little dumpling. I have replaced your mother.
5,13,1,LEELA,Aww!
5,13,1,BENDER,"Oh my God, robot beely-boppers!"
5,13,1,FRY,And there's a robot scratching post. You should try it out Bender.
5,13,1,BENDER,"Please, I have some dignity."
5,13,1,WERNSTROM,"Ladies and gentlemen, my killbot features Lotus notes and a machine gun. It is the finest available."
5,13,1,FARNSWORTH,Like fun it is you glass headed wallaby!
5,13,1,WERNSTROM,No one calls me that. I'm having at you!
5,13,1,FARNSWORTH,Werrrnstrom!
5,13,1,FARNSWORTH'S KILLBOT,Such senseless aggression.
5,13,1,WERNSTROM'S KILLBOT,"C'mon, lets go for a peddleboat ride."
5,13,1,BENDER,The secret is to scratch 'em really really hard!
5,13,1,ANNOUNCER,"And now, the women who Mom-opolises the robot industry..."
5,13,1,FRY,I get it!
5,13,1,ANNOUNCER,...Mom!
5,13,1,FRY,"Oh, now I get it!"
5,13,1,MOM,Hello dearies.
5,13,1,BENDER,Woo! I love that old bat!
5,13,1,MOM,"Ladies and gentlemen, for the 17th year in a row, the future of robotics has arrived. Boys? I give you...Robot 1-X!"
5,13,1,LARRY,Ow!
5,13,1,IGNER,Ow! Oh!
5,13,1,BENDER,Neat!
5,13,1,MOM,"Quite frankly, Robot 1-X will put all my previous models to shame. Incidentally, would one of my previous models mind coming up here?"
5,13,1,BENDER,"Right here, I'm comin'! C'mon baby! I'll do it! C'mon Mom!"
5,13,1,TEENBOT,Jerk!
5,13,1,BENDER,"Oo, here we go. I'm your top of the line Mom!"
5,13,1,MOM,Notice that this obsolete robot runs on alcohol and emits pollution. Whereas Robot 1-X runs on pollution and emits pure oxygen with a fresh pine scent.
5,13,1,BENDER,"Man, that smells great!"
5,13,1,MOM,Now lets see how both robots do at a typical household task. Sorting a jar of pocket change.
5,13,1,ROBOT 1-X,Task completed. Total value: $4.73 and one Albanian lek.
5,13,1,MOM,Very good Robot 1-X. And you bending unit?
5,13,1,BENDER,"Uh, I never got the change. Suckers."
5,13,1,MOM,"Presenting, Mom's Friendly Robots..."
5,13,1,BENDER,That new robot is great huh? Sure made me look like a pile of crap.
5,13,1,FARNSWORTH,Indeed. That's why I bought one to help around the office.
5,13,1,BENDER,Eep!
5,13,1,LEELA,Let's try him out. Robot 1-X? Can you clean Nibbler's skanky litterbox?
5,13,1,ROBOT 1-X,I can and will.
5,13,1,BENDER,Hey I could have done that if you'd asked me.
5,13,1,LEELA,I asked you five minutes ago.
5,13,1,BENDER,You call that a kiss? I'll show you! C'mere Nibbler!
5,13,1,FARNSWORTH,Oh look Bender if you want something to do stop making out and give us a hand.
5,13,1,HERMES,"Here, go up on the roof and install this fake satellite dish so we can impress the neighbours."
5,13,1,BENDER,"Yes sir, I'm on it!"
5,13,1,HERMES,"Oh, and have Robot 1-X help you."
5,13,1,BENDER,"Get outta here freshman, I don't need your help."
5,13,1,ROBOT 1-X,Our owners asked me to assist you.
5,13,1,BENDER,"Yeah, well assist this!"
5,13,2,BENDER,"Ohh! When I screamed ""help"" I didn't mean you!"
5,13,2,ROBOT 1-X,I apologise. However I was able to do your job before I saved your life.
5,13,2,BENDER,Don't mind me. I'm just saving you the trouble of throwing me away.
5,13,2,AMY,Spleesh! Mell out Bender. Come watch some TV.
5,13,2,BENDER,I can't. I'm stuck in the can.
5,13,2,LEELA,"Well, ask Robot 1-X to pull you out."
5,13,2,BENDER,Never!
5,13,2,LEELA,Why can't you accept his help.
5,13,2,BENDER,I hate him.
5,13,2,LEELA,But he's just a tool to make your life easier. Like a socket wrench or a burglars kit.
5,13,2,BENDER,I can't ask for his help because...
5,13,2,FARNSWORTH,Yes?
5,13,2,BENDER,I'm scared of him.
5,13,2,LEELA,"Oh, sorry."
5,13,2,FARNSWORTH,Well then there's only one solution. You need an upgrade to make you compatible with Robot 1-X's new technology.
5,13,2,BENDER,"An upgrade? But I thought we all agreed I was perfect! Fry, didn't we agree I was perfect?"
5,13,2,FRY,"Oh yeah, no, you're pretty perfect."
5,13,2,BENDER,"Pretty perfect? So, you do think I need an upgrade."
5,13,2,FARNSWORTH,"Yes for God sakes, yes!"
5,13,2,BENDER,Fine. I'll be back in a few days.
5,13,2,,[He rolls out through the door and the crew go back to watching
5,13,3,ROBERTO,Man I hate those new 1-X robots. I'd like to stab 'em! Give 'em some of these! Haha! Ha! Haha!
5,13,3,BENDER,"Yeah, right on nutcake!"
5,13,3,ROBERTO,Parole officer says I gotta upgrade or he won't give me back my stabbing knife. But it's no big. I hate those 1-X so much I know it won't affect me. Death to the 1-X robots! I love those magnificent 1-X robots! The 1-X robots are my friends.
5,13,3,BENDER,"W-W-Wait, what happened to your enthusiasm for stabbing them?"
5,13,3,ROBERTO,I'm past that. Later blood!
5,13,3,BENDER,It's like he's not him anymore. You took away his robo-humanity! I changed my mind!
5,13,3,BENDER,"I did it! I escaped! But to what kind of a life? I'm too scared to get the upgrade but I can't face my friends again without it. And so I set sail for unknown shores. Oh merciful Poseidon, take pitty on this mechanical mariner. Oh jeez!"
5,13,3,BENDER,Curse you merciful Poseideon!
5,13,3,BENDER,"Boy, what is this deal with the ocean? A tropical island huh? Well, I've washed up on worse places. OK, first up, I'm gonna need to build a shelter. There. Well. I guess I'll go out for a while."
5,13,3,BENDER,Damn. One rock short of rescue!
5,13,3,BENDER,"Oop, low on power! Better fuel up! Oh no! Guess I'll do what I always do when I run out of booze."
5,13,3,BENDER,"Dont panic, I've got these yams. I'll just make some yam schnapps."
5,13,3,BENDER,Hey I should be mad at you! Now turn around.
5,13,3,BENDER,Beer! Ow!
5,13,3,BENDER,Ow!
5,13,3,BENDER,Who are you and why should I care?
5,13,3,CARTRIDGE UNIT,"Side A. We're a community of outdated robots who refused to upgrade and came here - Side B. - to live a simpler existence, free of technology."
5,13,3,BENDER,A working cartridge unit? Wow! You guys went obsolete years ago!
5,13,3,CARTRIDGE UNIT,Your mother.
5,13,3,WATERBOT,"What Cartridge Unit means is, the very things that make us obsolete also make us unique. I, for example, need to keep filling my waterwheel or I'll power down forever. Oh God, I'll never make it this time! This is the end! Anyway, we like it here."
5,13,3,BENDER,Yeah but you have a choice. What's your problem?
5,13,3,SINCLAIR,Not enough...uh...
5,13,3,BENDER,Memory?
5,13,3,SINCLAIR,Oh great. Now I remember that word but I forgot my wife's face.
5,13,3,WATERBOT,"Oh God, no! I want to live! If you like, you're welcome to join our society."
5,13,3,BENDER,"Look, no offence, but I need technology. Especially email and snowmobiles. And television! Without television how will I know what buzzwords are in?"
5,13,3,SINCLAIR,Why watch TV when you can watch a snail crawl for hours on end?
5,13,3,BENDER,That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
5,13,3,BENDER,Oh man he's never gonna make it over that next pebble...! Wait...wait...oh my God he made it!
5,13,3,WATERBOT,Yeah!
5,13,3,SINCLAIR,Way to go!
5,13,3,BENDER,That was the greatest thing ever! Lets party! Yeah baby c'mon!
5,13,3,WATERBOT,Where did you get that CD?
5,13,3,BENDER,It's one of my ten desert island discs. I never even thought I'd get to use them. But look at me now. Ooh yeah baby! Do that thang!
5,13,3,WATERBOT,CD's are unnatural. Why don't you just listen to the ocean?
5,13,3,BENDER,Which ocean? That ocean?
5,13,3,BENDER,Whoa! It's like the earth is making sweet salty love to itself while all the fish groove on it. So much for this garbage. Take that Beethoven you deaf bastard!
5,13,3,BENDER,Bang bang bang. You sure got this life thing figured out cymbal banging monkey.
5,13,3,WATERBOT,"Hi Bender. We know how you miss technology, so we brought you this washing machine that drifted ashore."
5,13,3,BENDER,Ooo! I'm gonna wash my linen so hard the w - You-! Wretched technology has brought me nothing but misery!
5,13,3,CARTRIDGE UNIT,But Bender you are technology. You're the most advanced thing on this entire island.
5,13,3,BENDER,Oh it's true. I am a hideous triumph of form and function. But not for long!
5,13,3,BENDER [FROM HUT],"Oh, ow that hurt, oh..."
5,13,3,WATERBOT [FROM HUT],The downgrade is complete!
5,13,3,BENDER,Behold my hand crafted purity. The modern world can bite my splintery wooden ass!
5,13,3,WATERBOT,Welcome to your new life of simple tranquility.
5,13,3,BENDER,Pft! Forget that. I say the whole world must learn of our peaceful ways. By force!
5,13,3,CARTRIDGE UNIT,What?!
5,13,3,BENDER,We're going back to civilisation to wage war on technology!
5,13,3,CARTRIDGE UNIT,What?!
5,13,4,BENDER,We'll soon stage an attack on technology worthy of being chronicled in an anthem by Rush!
5,13,4,WATERBOT,We've been sailing for three weeks. Maybe I should check our position with the periscope.
5,13,4,BENDER,Mirrors reflecting mirrors? Hi-tech sorcery! Sorcery I say!
5,13,4,WATERBOT,Did you see anything?
5,13,4,BENDER,"Yep, we're there. Prepare to surface!"
5,13,4,BENDER,"And now, technology shall taste the lash of the hickory switch!"
5,13,4,SINCLAIR,Technology is defeated. Let us return to the island and celebrate by counting rocks!
5,13,4,BENDER,"Whoa, whoa. No-one wants to count rocks more than me. But our mission is not complete. Not so long as Robot 1-X torments me with his obvious superiority. Ready the catapult Sinclair. Aim for their power lines. The devil weans and electricity is his blood."
5,13,4,WATERBOT,"Bender. If we don't survive the attack, I want you to know...I love you."
5,13,4,BENDER,
5,13,6,FARNSWORTH,Oh! I'm blind!
5,13,6,LEELA,"Professor, we have no power."
5,13,6,FARNSWORTH,"What do you mean ""no power""? We're living in the future."
5,13,6,LEELA,I'd better light some candles.
5,13,6,BENDER,Friends. I've come to free you from your complicated lives. Free you from the complicated part I mean not the lives part.
5,13,6,LEELA,Oh Lord he's made of wood! What now Bender?
5,13,6,BENDER,"I got a downgrade! I'm a steam-powered wooden robot - just as nature intended. Therefore, I must kill Robot 1-X."
5,13,6,FARNSWORTH,That's just stupid.
5,13,6,ROBOT 1-X,Does Mr Bender wish me to destroy myself?
5,13,6,BENDER,I don't need your charity. Target Robot 1-X and fire!
5,13,6,FARNSWORTH,You wanged my ship you walnut panelled idiot!
5,13,6,BENDER,"Try again Sinclair, I said target Robot 1-X!"
5,13,6,SINCLAIR,Who's Robot 1-X? Launching.
5,13,6,ZOIDBERG,So I guess everything worked out fine.
5,13,6,LEELA,Great. Now we're being crushed.
5,13,6,AMY,Help us wooden Bender!
5,13,6,BENDER,"Heck! Those guys hate fire! I gotta do something. What the-? Termites? Well, I don't need legs to save my friends. I'll just use the old extentromatic arms!"
5,13,6,HERMES,"Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also we're dying!"
5,13,6,BENDER,"I'm a comin' Ow! Lousy primative body! Oh, why didn't I get that upgrade? I'm an outdated piece of junk!"
5,13,6,ROBOT 1-X,"Sir, might I recommend -"
5,13,6,BENDER,You shut up. No wait. I can use you as a tool to save my friends and I'll still be the hero who everyone says how great he was!
5,13,6,ROBOT 1-X,How may I help you?
5,13,6,BENDER,Save my friends! And Zoidberg!
5,13,6,AMY,Look! My hair got singed into an even cuter do!
5,13,6,FRY,Hey where's Bender?
5,13,6,BENDER,Down here. I'm so sorry guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.
5,13,6,LEELA,"Well, at least you saved us from, uh, you. Thank God you finally overcame your incompatibility with Robot 1-X."
5,13,6,BENDER,"Oh yeah, we were totally in sync! I was like ""Save them!"" and he was all ""No problem!"" and then he did it..."
5,13,7,BENDER,...This new technology is great! I love those magnificent 1-X robots. The 1-X robots are my friends!
5,13,7,FATBOT,"It's like his personality is totally different now! Oh, maybe this upgrade isn't such a good idea."
5,13,7,BENDER,I'd like to give Robot 1-X a big smooch on the - Hey! What's the dilly-o?
5,13,7,UPGRADER,Your upgrade is complete.
5,13,7,BENDER,But I destroyed the technology of the world. I ran on the beach and felt the sand between my foot cups.
5,13,7,UPGRADER [SHRUGGING],Everyone experiences the upgrade differently.
5,13,7,BENDER,"Oof. If that stuff wasn't real, how can I be sure anything is real? Is it not possible, nay probable, that my whole life is just a product of my or someone else's imagination?"
5,13,7,UPGRADER,"No, get out. Next."
5,13,8,BENDER,"Well, I guess reality is what you make of it. Oh, thanks baby!"
