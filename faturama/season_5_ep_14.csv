5,14,0,CALCULON [ON TV],Why Antonio?
5,14,0,MONIQUE [ON TV],Calculon?! But I thought you were -
5,14,0,CALCULON [ON TV],Egyptian?!
5,14,0,MONIQUE [ON TV],"Before I kill you, I must ask you one question. Who am I? For I have...amnesia!"
5,14,0,CALCULON [ON TV],Let me get this straight. Does anyone here not have amnesia?
5,14,0,MONIQUE [ON TV],Not sure.
5,14,0,HUMAN FRIEND [ON TV],I 'unno.
5,14,0,CUBERT,This show is awesome! When I grow up I'm gonna have so much amnesia!
5,14,0,DWIGHT,"Me too. I mean, I have it now, but I forgot."
5,14,0,CUBERT,Well mine's louder!
5,14,0,BENDER,Cram a ham in it you twerps! Sorry!
5,14,0,FRY,"Nah, I had it coming."
5,14,0,CALCULON [ON TV],Welcome swingers. Pull up a groove and get fabulous!
5,14,0,MONIQUE [ON TV],"Nude rocks bands, big piles of what I assume is talcum powder, it's quite a birthday party Calculon."
5,14,0,CUBERT,Cool! I'm gonna have a fabulatious birthday party just like Calculon!
5,14,0,DWIGHT,Oh yeah? Well I'm gonna show up looking good. Just like Monique.
5,14,0,LEELA,Do you two have to imitate everything you see on TV?
5,14,0,CUBERT,"Um, we're 12, so, yes."
5,14,0,DWIGHT,"Hold up Cubert, you're a clone of the Professor. Do clones even have birthdays?"
5,14,0,CUBERT,Well duh!
5,14,0,DWIGHT,"""Duh"" what?"
5,14,0,CUBERT,Dad? Do I have a birthday?
5,14,0,FARNSWORTH,"Hmm, you didn't have a birth so technically, no. Oh, don't feel bad. We can celebrate the day I extracted you from the cloning tank. Or the day I scraped that DNA from that growth on my back."
5,14,0,CUBERT,"Ooo, that one!"
5,14,0,FARNSWORTH,Ah yes. It was 13 years ago next week. I used this very fork.
5,14,0,HERMES,Aww well isn't that - ew!
5,14,0,DWIGHT,"Hey, next week'll be my birthday too."
5,14,0,HERMES,That's true. If only there were a way to have one party for both of you here at the office then write it off as a business expense. Wait! I thought of a way! The way I just said!
5,14,0,CUBERT,Yeah!
5,14,0,DWIGHT,Way to go pops!
5,14,1,CALCULON [ON TV],"Oh Monique, why did we wait so many years to bathe in champagne?"
5,14,1,ANTONIO [ON TV],"Father, I've discovered the shocking secret mother has kept from you for 200 years."
5,14,1,MONIQUE [ON TV],No! No!
5,14,1,ANTONIO [ON TV],"Brace yourself. For when I speak these words you may well suffer an attack of explosive amnesia. For you see, the horrible secret is -"
5,14,1,BENDER,Whoever's directing this is a master of suspense!
5,14,2,SAL,He's busteds. Lets get hims outta heres.
5,14,3,FRY,This show's been going downhill since season three.
5,14,3,ZOIDBERG,"Look who's here everyone! It's Zoidberg, the lovable tramp!"
5,14,3,LEELA,Since when are you performing at children's parties?
5,14,3,ZOIDBERG,"Performing? What? Please, if someone could spare me money to buy shoes -"
5,14,3,DWIGHT,This party pukes.
5,14,3,CUBERT,Yeah! The guests were supposed to be here three hours ago.
5,14,3,FARNSWORTH,Well that doesn't mean that no one is coming and that you two are total losers. Who gave you that idea?
5,14,3,DWIGHT,All right! They must've all come as a group.
5,14,4,CUBERT,Welcome swingers! Pull up a groove and get fabulous!
5,14,4,TINNY TIM,Good day fellows. Someone dumped this invitation in my begging cup. Happy growth-scraping day to all!
5,14,4,HERMES,Fire 'em all.
5,14,4,FARNSWORTH,"Mm-hm, mm-hm."
5,14,4,BENDER,"Guys, guys something's happening on television again."
5,14,4,MORBO [ON TV],"Welcome to Entertainment And Earth Invasion Tonite. Across the galaxy my people are completing the mighty space fleet that will exterminate the human race! But first, this news from Tinseltown."
5,14,4,LINDA [ON TV],"Following Antonio Calculon Jr's breakdown on set, the popular TV show All My Circuits will hold an open casting call for child robots to replace him."
5,14,4,BENDER,An open casting call for child robots? Tinny Tim? Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
5,14,4,TINNY TIM,What's that sir?
5,14,4,BENDER,"That I, Bender, am perfect for the role!"
5,14,4,TINNY TIM,You raised my hopes and dashed them quite expertly sir! Bravo!
5,14,4,LEELA,"Bender, your swarthy Latin charm will only get you so far. There's a lot of famous child acting units here."
5,14,4,FRY,"Look, there's Macaulay Culckon."
5,14,4,LEELA,He's just not cute since he got puberty installed.
5,14,4,FRY,Psst. There's that robot child actor who grew up an robbed a convenience store!
5,14,4,LEELA,And there's that robot child actor who grew up and became a convenience store!
5,14,4,ROBBERBOT,Lottery ticket please.
5,14,4,CASTING DIRECTOR,We're ready for the first audition. Emoteitron Jr?
5,14,4,MOMBOT,"Hold on precious, let's make you look nice for the lady. What's this? What did I tell you? No more hanging wires!"
5,14,4,CASTING DIRECTOR,"In this scene, you've just found out your real father is Calculon's fourth evil identical septuplet, Sleazy Martinez. OK...take us there!"
5,14,4,EMOTITRON JR,"Now that I know the truth father, I must ride south and join the robo-banditos at Veracruz."
5,14,4,CALCULON,"Well, I thought he was good but the audience seems to have turned on him."
5,14,4,CASTING DIRECTOR,But I don't think -
5,14,4,CALCULON,Next!
5,14,4,MACAULAY CULKON,"...at Veracruz, so, if you'll kindly hand me my poncho -"
5,14,4,CALCULON,Sorry kid you're flailing out there. 90 actors and they all got boo-ed. I just wish we could get this Bender I keep hearing about. They say he's the greatest.
5,14,4,CASTING DIRECTOR,Well there is a robot named Bender here but he's much too old -
5,14,4,CALCULON,Send him in forthwith!
5,14,5,BENDER,Boo! Not as good as Bender! Boo!
5,14,5,CASTING DIRECTOR,Mr Bender?
5,14,5,CASTING DIRECTOR,Have you ever been on TV before?
5,14,5,BENDER,"Once, when I took those hostages."
5,14,5,CALCULON,I saw that! You were good. Let's hear you audition.
5,14,5,BENDER,Banditos eh? Aw this is great! 'Cause I happen to have a flawless Spanish accent! I will say adios Padre! Come Jesus ye faithful. Tonight we eat...guacamole by the El Rio!
5,14,5,CALCULON,"That was so terrible I think you gave me cancer! I don't care how popular you are, you will never work on my show!"
5,14,5,CALCULON,"However, you've got the job. Welcome aboard son!"
5,14,5,BENDER,Fathero!
5,14,5,CALCULON,Bender I'd like you to meet our director......who's name I never learned.
5,14,5,BENDER,Yo! I read the script and I think it would help my character's motivation if he was on fire.
5,14,5,DIRECTOR,"Uh, don't worry 'bout the script baby, we re-wrote your part to better suit your acting abilities."
5,14,5,BENDER,So now my character has a British accent?
5,14,5,DIRECTOR,"No, now your character's in a coma. Get in bed and don't move. And...action!"
5,14,5,BENDER,Stupid dumb coma...coulda been British.
5,14,5,CALCULON,"Alas that mine only son should sink into an irreversible, permanent...coma."
5,14,5,BENDER,Permanent? That's completely out of character for Antonio. I'm gettin' up.
5,14,5,CALCULON,Curse the tragic wildebeast accident that -
5,14,5,BENDER,"Hey everyone! Antonio here but you can call me ""Bender""! I got ants in my butt and I needs to strut. C'mon baby! C'mon!"
5,14,5,CALCULON,I'm not familiar with the type of thing I'm seeing.
5,14,5,BENDER,"Bite my shiny metal ass! Ooo yeah! C'mon baby, do that, oo yeah!"
5,14,5,DIRECTOR,Cut! That's the worst coma acting I've ever seen. I'll have to shoot it again.
5,14,5,CALCULON,"No! No, no, no I don't do two takes."
5,14,5,DIRECTOR,But this guy was -
5,14,5,CALCULON,"Amateurs like you do two takes, I do one take. Print it, I'll be in my three storey trailer."
5,14,5,BENDER [ON TV],"Bite my shiny metal ass! Ooo yeah! C'mon baby, c'mon yeah!"
5,14,5,BENDER,Now that's hospital dancing. Pretty good eh Calcky?
5,14,5,CALCULON,Good? I've seen better acting from extras in Godzilla movies. I don't even remember shooting this scene.
5,14,5,DIRECTOR,We didn't. That's security camera footage from your dressing room.
5,14,5,CALCULON,He stole the scene and my money? That's it! I demand you fire this felonious ham!
5,14,5,DIRECTOR,The network Execubots are coming!
5,14,5,CALCULON,Dear God!
5,14,5,BETABOT,Presenting the president of the network.
5,14,5,NETWORK PRESIDENT,"Greetings gentlemen, you already know my Execubots. Executive Alpha, programmed to like things that are seen before."
5,14,5,ALPHABOT,Hey hey hey.
5,14,5,NETWORK PRESIDENT,"Executive Beta, programmed to roll dice to determine the fall schedule."
5,14,5,BETABOT,More reality shows.
5,14,5,NETWORK PRESIDENT,"And Executive Gamma, programmed to underestimate middle America."
5,14,5,GAMMABOT,It's funny but is it going to get them off their tractors?
5,14,5,NETWORK PRESIDENT,"Now, who put this obnoxious dancing robot on my network?"
5,14,5,DIRECTOR,We were about to fire him sir.
5,14,5,NETWORK PRESIDENT,"Silence hack! We've been monitoring our Nielsen families carefully and during the 12 seconds Bender was on screen, viewer eyeball focus was up 90%."
5,14,5,CALCULON,"Sir, children watch this show. Bender's no role model, he's a filth monger!"
5,14,5,NETWORK PRESIDENT,"At our network, we love filth! Filthy rich that is! Being filthy rich that is! ""Bite my shiny metal ass"" could be a catchphrase."
5,14,5,ALPHABOT,80% likely.
5,14,5,GAMMABOT,It will play in Peoria.
5,14,5,BETABOT,Gameshows are back.
5,14,5,NETWORK PRESIDENT,"We need this edgy, sweeps-ready robot on our network. Bender? Can you continue to drink, smoke and steal things on"
5,14,5,BENDER,Yes I can.
5,14,5,DWIGHT,"Yo, check out what I jacked from my Dad."
5,14,5,CUBERT,A cigar!
5,14,5,TINNY TIM,Ripping!
5,14,5,DWIGHT,Look! I'm Bender!
5,14,5,HERMES,Ras H. Tafari. What's goin' on here?
5,14,5,FARNSWORTH,The ruffians smoked one of your cigars.
5,14,5,HERMES,That's not a cigar. Uh...and it's not mine!
5,14,5,CUBERT,"Hey Dad, bite my shiny metal ass!"
5,14,5,FARNSWORTH,What? Such an act would be most uncomfortable for both of us! Where did you learn such language?
5,14,5,TINNY TIM,From Bender my good jerkwad.
5,14,5,HERMES,Bender eh? That guy's really startin' to twist my dreads.
5,14,5,BENDER,
5,14,5,ZOIDBERG,"Quiet robot, Bender's on TV."
5,14,5,MONIQUE [ON TV],"Oh Calculon, it's so good to get away from the city and that beastly, yet intriguing, Bender."
5,14,5,BENDER [ON TV],Try this kids at home!
5,14,5,LINDA [ON TV],Is television sensation Bender a bad role model for Earth children?
5,14,5,BENDER,That's crazy.
5,14,5,LINDA [ON TV],"A new protest group, Fathers Against Rude Television, says ""Hell yes!"""
5,14,5,FRY,Pft. What kind of bozos would start a Bender protest group?
5,14,5,FARNSWORTH,Good news everyone. Hermes and I have started a Bender protest group.
5,14,5,ZOIDBERG,That was uncanny.
5,14,5,HERMES,Fathers Against Rude Television don't want our kids watching Bender's high definition filth.
5,14,5,FARNSWORTH,And for what? Some kind of cheap laugh? That's not what F-A-R-T is all about.
5,14,5,HERMES,"No sir, not us FARTers."
5,14,5,BENDER,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't censor me just 'cause I'm an obscenely bad role model."
5,14,5,LEELA,"As unclean as it makes me feel, I agree with Bender. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV."
5,14,5,FRY,Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.
5,14,5,CUBERT,Our dads are all pumped up on dorkosterum. We're just trying to be cool like Bender.
5,14,5,DWIGHT,"Yeah, and it's not even working. Smoking and drinking make us barf."
5,14,5,TINNY TIM,Gentle jerkwads. I know how to emulate Bender without barfing. We could commit a burglary.
5,14,5,DWIGHT,"Hey, yeah!"
5,14,5,CUBERT,Bender loves to burgle!
5,14,5,DWIGHT,Hold up though. Who could we rob? We don't even know anyone with cool stuff.
5,14,5,CUBERT,Duh! We know someone who runs on pure cool fuel. Bender!
5,14,5,DWIGHT,Whoa!
5,14,5,TINNY TIM,We'll rob Bender!
5,14,5,DWIGHT,
5,14,5,CUBERT,
5,14,6,FRY,Hey Bender. Hey Bender. Hey Bender. Hey Bender.
5,14,7,FARNSWORTH,What's going on in here? Oh. Now I'm really outraged.
5,14,7,HERMES,"Where did you requisition this party? And Zoidberg, what are you doing here?"
5,14,7,ZOIDBERG,I'm networking. Let me give you my card.
5,14,7,CUBERT,"Relax Dad, we just invited a few friends over."
5,14,7,FARNSWORTH,Hmm. There's something wrong with your story but I can't put my finger on it. Of course! You don't have friends!
5,14,7,HERMES,Yeah. Why do these popular kids consider you cool all of a sudden?
5,14,7,DWIGHT,Uh...we're just cool is all!
5,14,7,FARNSWORTH,"Balderdash! I'll be the judge of who's cool, using the cool-o-meter!"
5,14,7,COOL-O-METER,Oh yeah!
5,14,7,FARNSWORTH,"Good Lord, I'm getting a reading of over 40 mega-Fonzies!"
5,14,7,HERMES,Everybody out!
5,14,7,ZOIDBERG,"So do you guys know about anything else going on, because I'm totally still ready to party."
5,14,7,HERMES,There's enough cool stuff here to furnish a happenin' pad. Where did it all come from?
5,14,7,TINNY TIM,Don't tell comrades. All for one and one for all!
5,14,7,DWIGHT,We stole it!
5,14,7,TINNY TIM,Oh crumb!
5,14,7,BENDER,What? What's going on?
5,14,7,FARNSWORTH,I'll tell you what. Our boys have taken up stealing! One of the worst and coolest of crimes.
5,14,7,HERMES,And all from watching you on TV you cool jerk.
5,14,7,BENDER,Hey lay off me. TV would stink if everyone on it was a positive role model. Bender is about entertainment baby! You can't hold me responsible for what kids do when - hey! This is my stuff they stole! That's the last straw! Bender should not be allowed on television!
5,14,7,BENDER,Bender must be stopped. I've gone too far. Who does that guy think I am? C'mon! We're gonna march all the way to Hollywood and make them stop forcing their filthy me down our throats.
5,14,7,,"[Cut to: Planet Express: Hangar. Bender marches up the ship's steps followed by Hermes, Farnsworth and the other members of"
5,14,8,FART MOB,Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender!
5,14,8,BENDER,This mob's with me.
5,14,8,SECURITY GUARD,Go ahead.
5,14,8,FART MOB,Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with - - Bender! Down with Bender!
5,14,9,CALCULON,"As a doctor and captain of this hospital shift, I now pronounce you man and wife with six months to live."
5,14,9,FARNSWORTH,Listen up Hollywood. We're an exciting new mob.
5,14,9,BENDER,Yeah!
5,14,9,HERMES,You'd better believe it!
5,14,9,CALCULON,Great Shatner's ghost!
5,14,9,BENDER,We demand that all TVs be equipped with a v-chip that blocks Bender from appearing on the screen.
5,14,9,FARNSWORTH,Booya!
5,14,9,NETWORK PRESIDENT,I'm afraid the answer is a gritty in-your-face no.
5,14,9,BENDER,Then I quit.
5,14,9,NETWORK PRESIDENT,Then you don't quit. I think you'll be finishing the scene now Mr Bender and don't skimp on the nasty.
5,14,9,FARNSWORTH,There'll be no further nasty. We still have the option of resorting to violence.
5,14,9,HERMES,What makes you think that'll work?
5,14,9,FARNSWORTH,I saw it on TV in that episode where Bender shot Calculon! How cool is that?
5,14,9,BENDER,Ooo yeah baby c'mon -
5,14,9,FARNSWORTH,Quit the show!
5,14,9,NETWORK PRESIDENT,Do the scene.
5,14,9,FARNSWORTH,I'm a cold blooded punk!
5,14,9,NETWORK PRESIDENT,I once put a laugh track on a sitcom that had no jokes in it.
5,14,9,BENDER,"Hey look, the prop guy has a lamp!"
5,14,9,NETWORK PRESIDENT,Really?
5,14,9,FARNSWORTH,Wha?
5,14,9,BENDER,Aha!
5,14,9,FARNSWORTH,I was using that!
5,14,9,BENDER,"Listen up, 'cause I've got a climactic speech! You, cameraman, keep the camera rolling. You, director, gimmie my motivation."
5,14,9,DIRECTOR,You're angry.
5,14,9,BENDER,"Perfect. Viewers of the world, do smoking and drinking on TV really make me cool? Of course they do. How 'bout committing crimes and violence? Again, the answer is ""yes."" But do we really want our kids exposed to that kind of trash on TV? I say absolutely not! Uh...on the other hand, most - perhaps all the blame rests with the parents. That's right you! And so I ask you this one question: Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?"
5,14,9,HERMES,We're just so busy.
5,14,9,BENDER,Well make time.
5,14,9,DIRECTOR,And...cut!
5,14,9,CALCULON,Good enough. Splice in some reaction shots of me and shove it on the air.
5,14,9,BENDER [ON TV],"...Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?"
5,14,9,HERMES,"Well, I'd say we all learned a valuable lesson about TV there."
5,14,9,CUBERT,What was it?
5,14,9,FARNSWORTH,"Uh...that we should all take TV a little less seriously. And more importantly, turn it off once in a while."
5,14,9,FRY,Hear hear!
5,14,9,LEELA,Yeah!
5,14,9,BENDER,Damn right!
5,14,9,DWIGHT,"So, should we turn it off now?"
5,14,9,FARNSWORTH,"Well, uh, that depends what's on."
5,14,9,FRY,Nothing good.
5,14,9,FARNSWORTH,Ah let's just keep watching.
5,14,9,BENDER,
5,14,9,FARNSWORTH,Wha?
5,14,9,BENDER,
5,14,9,FARNSWORTH,Oh!
5,14,9,FRY,We've got nothing better to do...
5,14,9,LEELA,...Than watch TV and have a couple of brews!
5,14,9,ZOIDBERG,Don't wanna talk about anything else...
5,14,9,FRY,We don't wanna know!
5,14,9,FARNSWORTH,"We're dedicated, yes!"
5,14,9,HERMES,...To our favourite shows!
5,14,9,CUBERT,All My Circuits
