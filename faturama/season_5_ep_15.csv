5,15,0,"""THE DEVIL'S HANDS ARE IDLE PLAYTHINGS""","By Ken Keeler Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
5,15,0,BENDER,Huh? I choose to not understand these signs.
5,15,1,BENDER,Aha!
5,15,1,FRY,Bender?? I was just not playing the holophonor.
5,15,1,BENDER,Yeah well you should try not stinking at it.
5,15,1,FRY,I am trying. I've been taking lessons.
5,15,1,BENDER,Lessons? Oh that's rich! Isn't it time you gave up all hope of ever improving yourself in any way?
5,15,1,FRY,"I know I should but I just can't. Remember when I had those stomach worms that made me smart? I could play the holophonor and it made Leela like me. Hey Bender, as long as you know, I have a holophonor recital Tuesday and I'd really like to have somebody there. Please?"
5,15,1,BENDER,Fine I'll go already. Y'know sometimes I wish your real parents were still alive...not often.
5,15,1,BENDER,Whoa...hey!
5,15,1,FRY,Uh...hello Mrs Mellenger.
5,15,1,MRS MELLENGER,Hello Philip. And you must be Mr Bender. Philip's told me so much about you. Is it true that you're a robot?
5,15,1,BENDER,"I prefer the term ""love machine."""
5,15,1,BENDER,"Wow, your kid is great. How hard did you say you had to hit him?"
5,15,1,MOTHER,Fairly hard.
5,15,1,FRY,The...Grumpy Snail. Sorry.
5,15,1,KID,It's too grumpy!
5,15,1,FRY,Ow! No! Quit it! Stop it!
5,15,1,MRS MELLENGER,"Mr Bender, I simply can not teach your child."
5,15,1,BENDER,Then good day madam! We hope to see you soon for tea.
5,15,1,FRY,It's hopeless. I can hear all this great music in my head but my stupid hands can't keep up.
5,15,1,BENDER,"Aww, you know what always cheers me up? Laughing at other people's misfortunes."
5,15,1,LEELA,"Hey guys, you missed a great delivery to Space Earth. Where you been all afternoon?"
5,15,1,FRY,Uh...a concert.
5,15,1,LEELA,Ooo was it jazz-noodling? My ex-boyfriend Sean played the sax. I used to listen for hours while he sat naked on my couch and improvised.
5,15,1,BENDER,So musicians really Rodger your Hammerstein huh?
5,15,1,LEELA,"Yeah, it's weird. Sean was uneducated, unambitious. He was pastey and hunched..."
5,15,1,FRY,Pretty boy.
5,15,1,LEELA,"...But when he played I could sense this incredible, beautiful creative soul. Then one day I found someone else's couch fibres on his butt."
5,15,1,FRY,It could be my beautiful soul sitting naked on her couch if I could just learn to play this stupid thing.
5,15,1,BENDER,"Oh but you can. Although you may have to metaphorically make a ""deal with the devil."" And by ""devil"" I mean ""Robot Devil."" And by ""metaphorically"" I mean ""get your coat."""
5,15,1,ROBOT DEVIL,"God, you hit a sour note about 200 years back Doug! Let's take it from the top. Ah Bender, Fry. You've come back for more eternal damnation."
5,15,1,BENDER,"No, this isn't a religious visit. Fry just wants holophonor lessons."
5,15,1,FRY,Yep. I need to get really good without practicing.
5,15,1,ROBOT DEVIL,"Hell is full of ten year olds who wanted exactly the same thing. Trouble is, you have what my old music teacher Mrs Mellenger called ""stupid fingers."" With hands like that you'll be lucky to master a belt buckle. Now wouldn't it be nice if you had a pair of robot hands to replace them?"
5,15,1,FRY,Sure it would. Oh well. Goodbye.
5,15,1,BENDER,"Fry you smelly idiot, I think he's willing to make some kind of deal with the devil with you."
5,15,1,FRY,"He is? Great! Wait, what's the catch?"
5,15,1,ROBOT DEVIL,"No catch. I'll merely pick a robot at random from somewhere in the universe - probably one you've never even met - and then I'll remove his hands and switch them for yours. It's just the sort of guy I am, what do you say?"
5,15,1,FRY,I don't know. It doesn't seem entirely moral to -
5,15,1,BENDER,Fry if you don't take this offer right now I will lose all respect for you and punch you.
5,15,1,FRY,Well...alright. You sure I probably won't know him?
5,15,1,ROBOT DEVIL,Definitely probably not. Just sign this contract.
5,15,1,BENDER,Wow.
5,15,1,ROBOT DEVIL,And here we go!
5,15,1,BENDER,I got a hundred bucks on Rectal-Exambot!
5,15,1,FRY,Robot Devil? I get your hands? Zam!
5,15,1,ROBOT DEVIL,Oh what an appallingly ironic outcome.
5,15,1,BENDER,It's not ironic it's just coincidental. Now fork over those lady-fingers cookie!
5,15,1,ROBOT DEVIL,Y'know I only put my name on there as a show of good faith for the other robots.
5,15,1,FRY,Stop being such a baby and chop my hands off.
5,15,1,ROBOT DEVIL,Oh very well.
5,15,1,FRY,How'd you do that?
5,15,1,ROBOT DEVIL,They're very good hands.
5,15,1,FRY,At last! At last I have the power to make Leela love me.
5,15,1,ROBOT DEVIL,"Oh sorry, that'll wear off in a couple of days."
5,15,1,FRY,Check it out everyone. I'm back from hell and I've got the Robot Devil's hands!
5,15,1,AMY,Neat! Let's see a trick.
5,15,1,FRY,Alrighty!
5,15,1,SCRUFFY,Somebody called the Robot Devil's here to see somebody called Fry.
5,15,1,FRY,Uh-oh.
5,15,1,BENDER,Where'd I go just now?
5,15,1,ROBOT DEVIL,Hello Fry. Just dropped by to make sure you're as happy with our little deal as I am. Give me back my hands! These things are always touching me in places.
5,15,1,FRY,"Yeah, they get around! But I'm afraid we had a deal."
5,15,1,ROBOT DEVIL,It looks like I wasted a bus trip.
5,15,1,FRY,Yes you did.
5,15,1,GRUMPY SNAIL [ON TV],"Yes, now you can hear holophonor virtuoso Philip Fry play 900 of his classic themes in your own home on this two-record set. That's over 30 minutes of music for only $14.99."
5,15,1,ZOIDBERG,"Only $14.99 for a two-record set. Two records! Oh Zoidberg, at last you're becoming a crafty consumer! Hello? I'll take eight!"
5,15,1,SCRUFFY,Mr Hedonismbot to see you.
5,15,1,FRY,Show him in.
5,15,1,SCRUFFY,Very good sir.
5,15,1,HEDONISMBOT,"Ah Fry, congratulations. Your latest performance was as delectable as dipping my bottom over and over into a bath of the silkiest oils and creams!"
5,15,1,FRY,"Thank you sir, that's exactly what I was going for."
5,15,1,HEDONISMBOT,You were the sole diversion in what has been a pale and unamusing season. And so I would feign commission you write an opera.
5,15,1,FRY,"But, I've never written an opera."
5,15,1,HEDONISMBOT,"And I've never heard one. Still, if you can keep me amused through the overture I shall consider it a smashing success."
5,15,1,FRY,But I wouldn't even know what to write about. Unless... OK I'll do it. If I can make it about Leela.
5,15,1,LEELA,Me? Really?
5,15,1,HEDONISMBOT,"A man writing an opera about a woman? Oh sera, how deliciously absurd! I shall see you at the premiere."
5,15,3,LEELA,Is it part of the opera?
5,15,3,FRY,Leela! You shouldn't be listening. I-I don't want you to hear it 'til it's done.
5,15,3,LEELA,But it's so beautiful.
5,15,3,FRY,So's a peacock but you don't eat it 'til it's cooked. This has to be perfect. I want you to hear exactly what I hear when I think about you.
5,15,3,LEELA,Oh Fry. All this time you've had this incredible gift and I never knew. I've been a fool. A fully justified prudent fool. They're so cold.
5,15,3,FRY,No!
5,15,3,ROBOT DEVIL,"Ah Bender, this is a surprise! For you. Finding me in the refrigerator."
5,15,3,BENDER,True but at least I don't have the hiccups anymore. What up?
5,15,3,ROBOT DEVIL,Oh well it so happens I'm in the mood to make a deal with you.
5,15,3,BENDER,"Forget it, you can't tempt me."
5,15,3,ROBOT DEVIL,Really? There's nothing you want?
5,15,3,BENDER,"Hm. I forgot you could tempt me with things I want. Well, I suppose I've always wondered what it would be like to be more annoying."
5,15,3,ROBOT DEVIL,Nothing simpler! And all I ask in return is you hands. To replace these bony hotdogs!
5,15,3,BENDER,Grabby and Squeezy? Never! I love these guys!
5,15,3,ROBOT DEVIL,Is there anything else you would part with?
5,15,3,BENDER,"No, nothing ain't gonna happen."
5,15,3,BENDER,Yes! With this built-in stadium airhorn I can really annoy people. And all it cost me was my crotchplate.
5,15,3,ROBOT DEVIL,You certainly are a shrewd businessman Bender. Now find someone and give 'em a good blast!
5,15,3,BENDER,"Yeah, that'll teach the first person I see a lesson!"
5,15,3,ROBOT DEVIL,"Ah, my ridiculously circuitous plan is one-quarter complete!"
5,15,4,LEELA,"Well, Fry's opera premiere's tomorrow night. I'm off to find a pair of formal gloves that'll fit over my enormous forearms."
5,15,5,BENDER,"Pretty annoying, huh Leela?"
5,15,5,LEELA,What? Are you talking? Oh God I'm deaf!
5,15,5,BENDER,Oops. I'm so so sorry Leela. I just wanted to annoy you.
5,15,5,LEELA,What? Oh this is horrible. I won't be able to hear Fry's opera.
5,15,5,ROBOT DEVIL,Ah how delightfully ironic.
5,15,5,BENDER,"It's not ironic, it's just mean. Take this!"
5,15,5,ROBOT DEVIL,Ooh! Out of aerosol? Also ironic!
5,15,5,BENDER,Oh yeah? Well bite my shiny metal - Oh nooo!
5,15,6,LEELA,"Nobody tell Fry I'm deaf. If he found out I couldn't hear his opera, it'd break his heart."
5,15,6,BENDER,
5,15,6,HEDONISMBOT,Courtesans and gentle fops. I bid you welcome to my opera. Let us cavort like the Greeks of old. You know the ones I mean.
5,15,6,LEELA,Yay Fry!
5,15,6,ZOIDBERG,I watch TV with that guy!
5,15,6,HOLO-VOGEL,Who is this one-eyed female baby Moses?
5,15,6,HOLO-ORPHANS,"A saviour from the stars,"
5,15,6,,Or something stranger still.
5,15,6,HOLO-LEELA,Or just some lonely filthy starving child.
5,15,6,LEELA,"Amy, Fry's looking at me. What am s'posed to be feeling? Ah!"
5,15,6,HOLO-BENDER,Leela! Leela Leela save him!
5,15,6,,"Save Fry, save Fry, Godzilla will devour him, As for me, I must be off, To have my doctor check this cough!"
5,15,6,,Goodbye!
5,15,6,BENDER,I don't recall ever fighting Godzilla but that is so what I would have done.
5,15,6,AMY,One diet double Martini please.
5,15,6,BARTENDER,And for you sir?
5,15,6,HERMES,I'll just have a Shirley Hemple.
5,15,6,TINNY TIM,Extra! Extra! World's greatest opera only half over!
5,15,6,LEELA,"Half over? Oh, I'd give anything to hear the rest."
5,15,6,ROBOT DEVIL,"Anything? Thank you sir. Now, as I was saying, anything? Because I can give you new robotic ears!"
5,15,6,LEELA,"What? You can give me new ears? Wait, what seemingly reasonable thing do you want in return?"
5,15,6,ROBOT DEVIL,Just your hands my dear.
5,15,6,LEELA,"Whatever you said, forget it!"
5,15,6,ROBOT DEVIL,"Alright, just one hand."
5,15,6,LEELA,Just...my left hand? Um...uh...
5,15,6,ANNOUNCER,Please take your seats for act two.
5,15,6,HEDONISMBOT,But I'm not done vomiting.
5,15,6,LEELA,I can't stand it! OK. You can have my hand.
5,15,6,ROBOT DEVIL,"Wonderful! Just sign here. Calculon old friend, I'm afraid I need your ears."
5,15,6,CALCULON,Well I do owe you for giving me this unholy acting talent!
5,15,6,LEELA,"I can hear! I can hear like a safecracker! Hey, aren't you gonna take my hand?"
5,15,6,ROBOT DEVIL,"In good time, you go enjoy the opera."
5,15,6,HOLO-FRY,"To win Leela's heart with the holophonor's art,"
5,15,6,HOLO-ROBOT DEVIL,"Well I don't see any danger,"
5,15,6,,"In gambling with a stranger, For my head is of a most amazing thickness."
5,15,6,,"I'm stupid, I'm stupid, I'm stupider than you, I'm stupider than you in every way!"
5,15,6,ROBOT DEVIL,Stupider? Pah! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry.
5,15,6,FRY,"Look, what do you want?"
5,15,6,ROBOT DEVIL,I want my hands back.
5,15,6,FRY,"Never! A deal's a deal, Even with a dirty dealer."
5,15,6,ROBOT DEVIL,"Very well, Then I'll take what I want from Leela."
5,15,6,LEELA,Whoa!
5,15,6,ROBOT DEVIL,Leela has promised me her hand.
5,15,6,LEELA,"Fry, you do not understand."
5,15,6,,"I should have revealed I've been deafened by Bender, The shame, The shaaame, But I feared you'd stop writing this musical splendour, Deception's the curse of my whimsical gender, He gave me mechanical ears, Effective though just a bit garish, In return without shedding a tear I agreed that I'd give him my hand..."
5,15,6,ROBOT DEVIL,...In marriage!
5,15,6,LEELA,What?
5,15,6,ROBOT DEVIL,You'd give me your hand in marriage.
5,15,6,HERMES,Is this really happening or just being staged?
5,15,6,FARNSWORTH,It can't be real -
5,15,6,AMY,Not if Leela is engaged!
5,15,6,LEELA,"That isn't what I meant,"
5,15,6,,That isn't what I signed.
5,15,6,ROBOT DEVIL,You should have checked the wording in the fine... Print!
5,15,6,LEELA,I'll give you my hand...
5,15,6,BENDER,"The use of words expressing something other than their literal intention,"
5,15,6,,"Now that is ""irony!"""
5,15,6,ROBOT DEVIL,"I will marry her now and confine her to hell,"
5,15,6,FRY,"Destiny has cheated me by forcing me to decide upon,"
5,15,6,NIXON,Arooo!
5,15,6,ZAPP,Bray-vo! Enn-core!
5,15,6,FARNSWORTH,I can't believe the devil is so unforgiving.
5,15,6,ZOIDBERG,I can't believe everyone is just ad-libbing!
5,15,6,PREACHERBOT,"By the power vested in me,"
5,15,6,,By the state of New New York -
5,15,6,FRY,No! Stop! Take my hands! You evil metal dork!
5,15,6,HEDONISMBOT,Surgery in an opera? How wonderfully decadent and just as I was beginning to lose interest. The chocolate icing! Oh my!
5,15,6,FRY,My hands. My horrible human hands. And what did you do to my nails?
5,15,6,ROBOT DEVIL,I cleaned them. Now if you'll excuse me it's my poker night and I feel lucky. So it's back to hell for me. Come on Nixon!
5,15,6,NIXON,Huh?
5,15,6,HEDONISMBOT,"Less reality, more fantasy. Resume the opera."
5,15,6,FRY,But I can't play anymore.
5,15,6,ZOIDBERG,"Yes you can. The beauty was in your heart, not your hands. The music's bad and you should feel bad."
5,15,6,FRY,"Ah! Ooo, ah, whoa, hey!"
5,15,6,TINNY TIM,Extra! Extra! Greatest opera of all time sucks!
5,15,6,ZOIDBERG,I'll take eight!
5,15,6,LEELA,Please don't stop playing Fry. I wanna hear how it ends.
