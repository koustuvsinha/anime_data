5,3,0,"""A TASTE OF FREEDOM""","By Eric Horsted Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
5,3,0,ZOIDBERG,"Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!"
5,3,0,FRY,"There's no denying it: The future's crazy! Oh, well. Don't wanna stand out."
5,3,0,FRY AND ZOIDBERG,"Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!"
5,3,0,ZOIDBERG,There's nothing crazy about it. It's just Freedom Day!
5,3,0,FARNSWORTH,... an extremely dangerous mission ...
5,3,0,FRY,"So, what is Freedom Day? Sounds like some kind of feminine hygiene product."
5,3,0,ZOIDBERG,"No, it's a fabulous, crab-ulous day!"
5,3,0,AMY,"If you wanna do something, you do it! And to splick with the consequences!"
5,3,0,BENDER,You know? Like how I live every day.
5,3,0,HERMES,Happy Freedom Day! Ooh! I think my wrist is broken.
5,3,0,FARNSWORTH,"Of course, it wouldn't be Freedom Day without the traditional Freedom Tub!"
5,3,0,HERMES,Mmm! That'll feel nice on my shattered bones!
5,3,0,FRY,Wow! Nude hot-tubbing? That's all I need to hear about Freedom Day!
5,3,0,ZOIDBERG,"Then consider the following lecture a bonus: On Earth, freedom is a given. But on my planet, we have to suffer for it."
5,3,0,DECAPODIAN WOMAN,"Sure, you can be a comedian instead of a doctor -- If you want your parents to roll over in their graves!"
5,3,0,DECAPODIAN MAN,Sure. You can vote for Shkinadel -- If you want there should be a recession!
5,3,0,DECAPODIAN WOMAN,Sure. You can go to medical school -- If you've given up on your dream of being a comedian!
5,3,0,ZOIDBERG,"That's why I love Earth! You can do what you want, and no-one makes you feel guilty because no-one cares."
5,3,0,FRY,We're not listening!
5,3,0,ZOIDBERG,That's what I'm talking about!
5,3,0,STILT PEOPLE,"Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy! Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!"
5,3,0,BENDER,"Scuse me, comin' through. Freedom train arriving on track one."
5,3,0,WOMAN,Ow! You broke my foot!
5,3,0,BENDER,Freedom!
5,3,0,MORBO,"What's this next float, Linda?"
5,3,0,LINDA,"Representing our men, women and children in uniform, it's Earth's greatest space hero, Zapp Brannigan!"
5,3,0,ZAPP,"Happy Freedom Day, ladies! Come on, let loose and show me something! Anything. Seriously, I'd take an armpit. Oh, yeah! Thank you, Linda!"
5,3,0,LINDA,"You're welcome! OK, Morbo, now it's your turn."
5,3,0,MORBO,If that is your Freedom Day wish.
5,3,0,NIXON,"Thank you, Secretary of Transportation. My fellow Earthicans, we enjoy so much freedom, it's almost sickening. We're free to choose which hand our sex-monitoring chip is implanted in. And if we don't want to pay our taxes, why, we're free to spend a weekend with the Pain Monster."
5,3,0,PAIN MONSTER,"See you April 15th, folks!"
5,3,0,NIXON,"Cue the fireworks guy! Incidentally, tonight's Freedom Day celebration is brought to you by ... ... ""Shankman's Rubbing Compound"". When something needs rubbing, think ""Shankman""."
5,3,0,BENDER,Yay! Shankman!
5,3,0,HERMES,It costs a little more but it's worth it!
5,3,0,NIXON,"Our planet has been through so much this past year: Wars, droughts, impeachments! But we've never lost our sense of what's truly important: The great taste of ""Charleston Chew""! And now, let us salute that beloved symbol of freedom, our flag, Ol' Freebie!"
5,3,0,ZOIDBERG,I'm swelling with patriotic mucus!
5,3,0,NIXON,"In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms!"
5,3,0,FRY,Anyone who laughs is a Communist!
5,3,0,NIXON,"Knowing that, with a shifty glance skyward, we will see by the rocket's red glare, that our flag is still there. It's gone!"
5,3,0,ZOIDBERG,"Yes, fellow patriots, I ate your flag. And I did it with pride. For to express oneself with doing a thing is the very essence of Freedom Day! Bless this planet and all its wonderful people!"
5,3,0,NIXON,Kill him! Kill the traitor!
5,3,0,MAN,"Hey, it's the guy who desecrated our flag!"
5,3,0,NIXON,Stop that red menace!
5,3,1,ZOIDBERG,I'm all scuttled out! Huh? My planet's embassy? They're paid to not kill me! A-yoop!
5,3,1,ZOIDBERG,"I thought I understood this world. I thought I was fitting in. But I guess I don't belong on here anymore than I belong on our crappy home planet-- Ooh, sorry."
5,3,1,DECAPODIAN MAN,"What sorry? Our planet stinks, we all know it."
5,3,1,AMBASSADOR MOIVIN,"Enough with the persecution, I'm saying. Zoidberg, as Ambassador, I promise you the full support of our government already."
5,3,1,DECAPODIAN WOMAN,Poor boy. You want maybe a nice mug cocoa?
5,3,1,ZOIDBERG,"Ambassador Moivin, you and your staff are so kind. I'm truly humbled. What, no marshmallows?"
5,3,2,NIXON,Let's storm the place ... without my prior knowledge.
5,3,2,BENDER,"Scuse me, comin' through. Freedom train, step aside. You too, fatso. Freedom!"
5,3,2,LEELA,"Cool your jowls, Nixon. You may not like it that Dr. Zoidberg desecrated a flag. You might even find the image of it festering in his bowels somehow offensive. But the right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Earth constitution."
5,3,2,NIXON,Aroo! Maybe so. But I know a place where the constitution doesn't mean squat.
5,3,2,MYRTLE FU,The Supreme Court hereby accepts the case of Earth vs Zoidberg.
5,3,2,NIXON,Sock it to 'em!
5,3,2,CROWD,"Two, four, six, eight, Eating the flag is bad."
5,3,2,SCOUT LEADER,Now your noose knot has exactly seven twists.
5,3,2,MAN,"You can eat my dog, You can eat my truck, But you eat my flag, And you're outta luck!"
5,3,2,,"She's a-wavin' proud around the world, From Dallas to Fort Worth, Let me say it again,"
5,3,2,CROWD,Don't mess with Earth!
5,3,2,FRY,They sure hate Dr. Zoidberg.
5,3,2,BENDER,Pft. Posers! I was hating Zoidberg before it was cool.
5,3,2,FRY,Where are we ever going to find a lawyer to take his case?
5,3,2,LEELA,I'll ask the head of the ACLU. Once he's done singing.
5,3,2,MAN,Don't mess with Earth. Kill Zoidberg! Goodnight!
5,3,2,OLD MAN WATERFALL,Howdy there! I'm a lawyer and I'd like to help your friend out of his pickle.
5,3,2,FRY,"Who are you, old man?"
5,3,2,OLD MAN WATERFALL,"Name's Old Man Waterfall. But most folks just call me ""Old Man""."
5,3,2,FRY,I'll never remember that.
5,3,2,OLD MAN WATERFALL,"I'm a veteran of three dozen wars. Name a body part and a planet and I've taken a bullet in it, on it. All to keep our flag flying free."
5,3,2,BENDER,"And you wanna defend Zoidberg? Are you familiar with the old robot saying ""Does Not Compute""?"
5,3,2,OLD MAN WATERFALL,"Son, to me a robot's just a garbage can with sparks comin' out it."
5,3,2,BENDER,The sparks keep me warm.
5,3,2,OLD MAN WATERFALL,I don't condone what Dr. Zoidberg did but I'll fight tooth and nail for his freedom to do it. Or I would if I hadn't lost my teeth and nails on Mars and Saturn respectively.
5,3,2,FRY,"Wait, you're a lawyer? You're hired!"
5,3,2,FRY,"You OK there in the embassy, Zoidberg?"
5,3,2,HOLO-ZOIDBERG,No. There's no coaco marshmallows and every night the rats eat a little more of my foot.
5,3,2,BAILIFF,"Oyez, oyez, oyez. All rise for the Honourable Chief Justice, Myrtle Fu, and the associate justices."
5,3,2,MYRTLE FU,"Counsel, you may address the court on behalf of Earth, if you're ready."
5,3,2,HYPER-CHICKEN,"I was hatched ready! Honourable judge heads, yonder crawdad done ate up our flag."
5,3,2,HOLO-ZOIDBERG,I was doing freedom of speech. Earth's most sacred right.
5,3,2,HYPER-CHICKEN,"Your Honour, freedom of speech applies to what comes out of a mouth. Not what goes in."
5,3,2,O'CONNOR,Can counsel cite precedent?
5,3,2,HYPER-CHICKEN,"Uh, yes darlin', I can. In ""State Of Alabama vs. Giant Space Iguana"", chewin' the corners off the constitution was deemed ""nonprotected speech""."
5,3,2,SOUTER,"He shut you up, O'Connor."
5,3,2,MYRTLE FU,"Mr. Waterfall, you may now present arguments on behalf of Dr. Zoidberg."
5,3,2,HOLO-ZOIDBERG,"Oh, God, I'm nervous. Two of my three hearts are having attacks."
5,3,2,BENDER,Court's kinda fun when it's not my ass on the line! Nachos?
5,3,2,OLD MAN WATERFALL,"Oh, land-o-Goshen! Your Honours, I'm not some slick, big-city lawyer like my opponent here. But I am a veteran who has fought for his planet. You see this hand of mine?"
5,3,2,SCALIA,"Yes, I do."
5,3,2,OLD MAN WATERFALL,"No, you don't 'Cause I lost my real hand plantin' the flag when we took back Halley's Comet! Yet it was worth it. So much do I love that flag. I love it even more than I love my seven wives. That's right, I'm a polygamist. Yet I would gladly eat a flag myself, had I not used my intestine as a rope to hoist a flag made of my own skin, if it would protect the freedoms of the proud people who salute that flag. Freedom such as polygamy. I rest my case. Whoa, jeez!"
5,3,2,MYRTLE FU,"The justices and I will now confer using high-speed telepathy. By a vote of six to three, we find that flag eating is not protected by the constitution."
5,3,2,BENDER,Six to three? I beat the spread!
5,3,2,MYRTLE FU,The court orders an immediate public apology.
5,3,2,HOLO-ZOIDBERG,Apology accepted. Just don't let it happen again.
5,3,2,HERMES,"She means you, you turkey of the sea!"
5,3,2,HOLO-ZOIDBERG,"Me? Apologise? Never! I came to this planet to learn the meaning of freedom. But I say it's you who should get a nice lesson! So do your worst, because no punishment could be worse than denying my freedom."
5,3,2,MYRTLE FU,You are hereby sentenced to death.
5,3,2,HOLO-ZOIDBERG,"Wait, let me finish!"
5,3,2,MYRTLE FU,"Also, in a rare double-whammy decision, the court finds polygamy constitutional."
5,3,2,OLD MAN WATERFALL,I can't wait to tell my husband!
5,3,2,ZAPP,"Remember, men: Take him alive so there's something left to kill."
5,3,2,AMBASSADOR MOIVIN,Stay back! This embassy is sovereign mud of the mud planet Decapod 10. Invading these mud premises is an act of war.
5,3,2,ZAPP,"Yeah? Well what are you going to do about it, Shrimp-y?"
5,3,2,AMBASSADOR MOIVIN,"You wanna see, Mr. Big-Shot? Attack Earth. Yes I know it's a schlep. Just do it!"
5,3,2,ZOIDBERG,Aha! Now the rubber band's on the other claw!
5,3,2,ZAPP,Ready? Retreat!
5,3,3,PERSON,Sh!
5,3,4,ZOIDBERG,"Deny my freedom, will you? Well we'll do to you what we did to the Squash Men of the Squash Planet! Squish them!"
5,3,4,AMBASSADOR MOIVIN,Charleston Chew?
5,3,4,ZOIDBERG,You bet!
5,3,5,ZAPP,"Alright, Kif, let's show these freaks what a bloated, runaway military budget can do. Bring me the activation codes for our global defence network."
5,3,5,KIF,"Aye, aye, sir."
5,3,5,COMPUTER VOICE,Commence lip identification scan. No tongue.
5,3,5,ZAPP,"We can't be too careful with these codes. Rumour has it a double agent may be aboard this very ship. I'm watching you! You, ensign? What's your name?"
5,3,5,"""ENSIGN""","Hugh Man, sir!"
5,3,5,ZAPP,"Hugh Man? Now that's a name I can trust. Run down to the central battle computer and enter these codes. Chop, chop!"
5,3,5,KIF,"Um, sir? There's something about that ensign that's--"
5,3,5,ZAPP,You're damn right there is! That strapping young lad's gunning for your job. And he just might get it.
5,3,6,ZAPP,"The enemy approacheth! Lieutenant, fire missile one and recommend me for another medal. Make it gaudy, I'm going clubbing later. Tick, tock!"
5,3,6,KIF,"Sir, all planetary defences have been disabled. Perhaps the Decapodians acquired our secret codes, somehow."
5,3,6,ZAPP,"Well, Kif, stand by to take the blame. Steady, steady ... now!"
5,3,6,LEELA,"Dr. Zoidberg, how can you claim to love freedom and then enslave all of Earth?"
5,3,6,ZOIDBERG,"Bah! Your planet doesn't deserve freedom until it learns what it is to not have freedom. It's a lesson, I say."
5,3,6,FRY,Ow!
5,3,6,BENDER,What the hell is this dirt pile we're building anyhow?
5,3,6,ZOIDBERG,"None of your beeswax, slave! You'll find out soon enough. Just focus on globing that mud. Glob!"
5,3,6,FRY,I'm no good at being a slave. I'm thinking about graduate school. Y'know? To become a barber?
5,3,6,LEELA,This can't go on. Today is the day we fight back!
5,3,6,BENDER,It's already 10 o'clock!
5,3,6,LEELA,"Oh, you're right. Tomorrow is the day we fight back."
5,3,6,ZAPP,"Yeah? Well good luck, sister. All our modern technology is useless."
5,3,6,BENDER,I know I am.
5,3,6,FRY,"Hey, wait! I'm having one of those things. You know? A headache with pictures?"
5,3,6,LEELA,An idea?
5,3,6,FRY,"Back in my day, we didn't have your fancy all-digital weapons but we still managed to kill each other just fine."
5,3,6,BENDER,"Ah, the crossbow. A pitiless, elegant killing machine. The Bender of the 15th century."
5,3,6,FRY,Not big enough. We need something that can take out an entire army. Something you could commit a war crime with--
5,3,6,BENDER,Wow! Ow!
5,3,6,AMBASSADOR MOIVIN,"Earth slaves, behold the fruit of your labours: The Mobile Oppression Palace."
5,3,6,BENDER,Neat!
5,3,6,AMBASSADOR MOIVIN,"I don't need to tell you that occupation forces are expensive. But with the Mobile Oppression Palace, a few dignitaries can oppress your entire planet for pennies a day. Warships, dismissed!"
5,3,7,OLD MAN WATERFALL,"Do your worst, you sea devils! I'll make my stand with Ol' Freebie. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Argh! My spirit!"
5,3,7,FRIEDA WATERFALL,"Great Grandpa, no! Another victim of the mano-centric male-ocracy."
5,3,8,ZOIDBERG,"Ambassador Moivin, you killed my lawyer."
5,3,8,AMBASSADOR MOIVIN,You're welcome.
5,3,8,ZOIDBERG,He defended my freedom when no-one else would. He was a good and honourable man.
5,3,9,OLD MAN WATERFALL,I request a Satanic funeral.
5,3,10,ZOIDBERG,Is it possible that all this slavery and oppression is shmutzing up our freedom lesson?
5,3,10,AMBASSADOR MOIVIN,"Ah, take a pill, Zoidberg. Begin again with the crushing!"
5,3,12,FRY,"You haven't won yet, Moivin! You didn't expect us to even go to a museum, much less steal this ancient heat-seeking missile."
5,3,12,AMBASSADOR MOIVIN,I don't even know you.
5,3,13,DECAPODIAN WOMAN,"Oh, it's gonna make such a mess!"
5,3,14,AMBASSADOR MOIVIN,"This is your secret plan? Meh! Heat-seeking missiles are useless against the Mobile Oppression Palace. All Decapodian technology is cold-blooded, like us!"
5,3,15,ZOIDBERG,All eyes on Zoidberg! Ew!
5,3,15,BENDER,"Hey, I need that to smoke!"
5,3,15,FRY,"Zoidberg, how could you? I used to think you were cool."
5,3,15,ZOIDBERG,"Wait! People of Earth, listen. Yes, I'm desecrating a flag. But to preserve the freedom it represents!"
5,3,15,LEELA,"Zoidberg, you set us free! I feel like I could stand to hug you! I can't, but you know what I'm trying to say."
5,3,15,CROWD,Zoidberg! Zoidberg! Zoidberg!
5,3,15,ZOIDBERG,"Ah, if only they appreciated freedom this much on my home planet. Wait a second! They do! Because this is my home planet."
5,3,15,NIXON,"And now, to raise this beautiful new flag, a red lobster that won't ruin your dinner: Dr. John Zoidberg!"
5,3,15,ZOIDBERG,"You're a nice man, Nixon."
5,3,15,SCOOP CHANG,"Dr. Zoidberg, how's about you take a bite of the flag for tomorrow's papers?"
5,3,15,ZOIDBERG,"Oh, I couldn't."
5,3,15,NIXON,"No, no, no, go ahead. You've earned it!"
5,3,15,ZOIDBERG,"Well, maybe just a taste. Mmm! Now that's a grand old flag! I wonder what the Shroud of Turin tastes like."
