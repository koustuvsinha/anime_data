5,4,0,"""KIF GETS KNOCKED UP A NOTCH""","By Bill Odenkirk Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
5,4,0,AMY,Woohoo! Shman! The Great Rad Spot is mega sweet for mega party-boarding.
5,4,0,FARNSWORTH,Indeed.
5,4,0,AMY,Any calls while I was out?
5,4,0,LEELA,Yeah. You got a telesonic transmission from Kif a couple hours ago.
5,4,0,AMY,My Kiffie called? Kif?
5,4,0,KIF [ON SCREEN],Ooo Amy you're back. Another hour and I would have thought about hanging up.
5,4,0,AMY,Why didn't you just leave a message sweetie?
5,4,0,KIF [ON SCREEN],"Well um, I've left hundreds of messages with your answering machine but you never seem to..."
5,4,0,AMY (SHOUTING),Bender!
5,4,0,BENDER,Not my fault if you don't check me! Messages erased.
5,4,0,KIF [ON SCREEN],"Oh dearest, this long distance relationship is too much to bear......when even an inch seperates us I quiver with misery. So you can imagine how I feel when it's a billion light years."
5,4,1,AMY [ON SCREEN],"Kif, don't cry, or you'll get a tummy ache."
5,4,2,ZAPP [ON SCREEN],"Lieutenant, some things came off me and clogged the drain so if you could......oh ho! What's this?"
5,4,3,ZAPP,"Well well well! Do my eyes believe me or is that my bosomy swan, Leela?"
5,4,3,LEELA [ON SCREEN],Say again. You're breaking up!
5,4,4,FARNSWORTH,Good news everyone. You'll be delivering pain medicine to the hive mind of Nigel
5,4,4,SCRUFFY,Scruffy's rollin' out a large pill!
5,4,4,AMY,You're going to Nigel 7? Kif's on patrol near there! You could drop me off on the way!
5,4,4,FARNSWORTH,We could but we won't! It's a spaceship dammit not a prom limousine! If anyone needs me I'll be in the Angry Dome.
5,4,5,LEELA,"This is a very long trip, so we'll all have to go into hibernative-naptosis to save oxygen."
5,4,5,BENDER,I don't even breathe oxygen!
5,4,6,AMY (WHISPERING),Here I come Kif!
5,4,6,ZAPP,"They jump right out of their pants! Oh what now? Activate glass window. Kif, I'm sensing a very sensual disturbance in the force. Prepare for ship-to-ship intimacy!"
5,4,6,KIF,Yes sir captain!
5,4,8,ZAPP,How 'bout I help you finish that dream you were having about me?
5,4,8,LEELA,
5,4,8,ZAPP,"Uh, let's try that a little lower and a lot softer!"
5,4,8,KIF,Imagine you stowing away and stealing a licenced starship! Oh it's so romantic it gives me the shivvers!
5,4,8,AMY,I don't care how much trouble I get in. I needed to feel my lips pressed against your lipless beak!
5,4,8,KIF,"Oh Amy, I can't stand having a whole universe between us. I've been thinking a lot about this and, well, would you move in with me?"
5,4,8,AMY,Here? But...uh...wouldn't it be crowded?
5,4,8,KIF,"No no, it's really twice the size! You can use the floor and, I'll have the ceiling! See?"
5,4,8,AMY,"Kif! You have so much creativity and niceness, but......I'm not sure if I"
5,4,8,KIF,"Hush! Before you answer, come thither!"
5,4,8,KIF,"This is the Holo-Shed. It can simulate anything you desire, and nothing can hurt you. Except when it malfunctions and the holograms become real."
5,4,8,AMY,"Well, that probably won't happen this time."
5,4,8,KIF,I wanted to show you what life would be like if we were together. Computer: Run program Kif-1.
5,4,8,AMY,This is so beautiful! Spirit! Kif! That's the pony I always wanted but my parents said I had too many ponies already!
5,4,8,KIF,"Yes. I prgorammed it in for you! 4 million lines of BASIC! And, if this isn't the life you want, how 'bout this? Run program Kif-2!"
5,4,8,AMY,Oh Kif!
5,4,8,KIF,"We could live here by the shore of the tranquilibrious sea, in a timeshare. And I would pluck the moon from the sky, just to see you smile. Almost got it. It seems to be sort of, stuck! I love you! Run program Kif://3."
5,4,8,AMY,This isn't bad. My aunt had a place like this.
5,4,8,KIF,"Amy, we could live in a bus station bathroom for all I care. As long as we're together it will feel like a castle to me."
5,4,8,AMY,"Kif, I'd love to live with you...someday. But before then there's still lots I wanna do on my own. What was that?"
5,4,8,KIF,"Oh dear. I feel the Holo-Shed might be broken again. Well, as long as we don't cross paths with Atilla the -"
5,4,8,AMY,Look! Spirit!
5,4,8,KIF,"And there's Professor Moriarty, Jack The Ripper, Evil Lincoln!"
5,4,8,MORIARTY,"Right-o gents it's another simulation gone mad so murder and mayhem, standard procedure!"
5,4,8,JACK THE RIPPER,Rampage!!
5,4,8,EVIL LINCOLN,Real hologram simulated Evil Lincoln is back!!
5,4,8,KIF,"The Holo-Shed's on the fritz again, the characters turned real!"
5,4,8,ZAPP,Damn. The last time that happened I got slapped with three paternity suits. Listen up history's greatest villains......Get back into the Holo-Shed before I start blasting!
5,4,8,ATILLA THE HUN,Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!
5,4,8,ZAPP,Spare me your space-age technobabble Atilla The Hun!
5,4,8,AMY,Kif! Hold on!
5,4,8,KIF,I totally want to!
5,4,8,LEELA,Grab on!
5,4,8,FRY,Over here!
5,4,8,KIF,Hold me!
5,4,8,BENDER,"Have a good one! Aw, man!"
5,4,8,ZAPP,After all that I could use some relaxation. I'll be in the Holo-Shed.
5,4,8,DOCTOR,"Well, except for a few broken bones, some internal hemoraging and a partially barfed up heart, everyone appears fine. Oh and Kif is pregnant."
5,4,8,KIF,Oh joy!
5,4,8,KIF,"Amy, isn't it wonderful? I'm pregnant!"
5,4,8,AMY (UNSURE),Yes it's...great. A great miracle.
5,4,8,LEELA,And not one of those bogus everyday miracles like a sunrise. Aren't you a male?
5,4,8,BENDER,"Yeah what's the deal? Just when I thought I'd figured out you biological creatures, its something else! Lemme at 'im! Come...over...lemme...!"
5,4,8,ZAPP,"Look, I'm sure we're all a little unclear on how anyone gets pregnant. So Kif, pray explain. And don't spare the dirty words where appropriate."
5,4,8,KIF,"Well it's quite simple really. When one of my species experiences deep feelings of love we enter a so called ""receptive state."""
5,4,8,ZAPP,You disgust me! Go on.
5,4,8,KIF,"At that point, our skin becomes a semi-permeable membrane which allows the passage of genetic material. I held Amy's hand and voila."
5,4,8,BENDER,Oh OK. but that better be all there is!
5,4,8,KIF,Oh Amy! You'll be a mother!
5,4,8,KIF,What a wonderous affirmation of our love! And all from the touch of your hand.
5,4,8,FRY,Dude hold up! Remember when Zapp blew a hole in the ship?
5,4,8,EVIL LINCOLN,Indeed.
5,4,8,FRY,Kif touched everybody there. Couldn't any one of us be the mother?
5,4,8,AMY,Hey yeah! I mean...what about that Kif?
5,4,8,KIF,Well I suppose I might have gotten pregnant that way. Or even from a toilet seat. Though that's impossible since I have a private washroom.
5,4,8,ZAPP,"Ah, my home away from home. By the way Kif, your flush seemed to be set on stun, not kill."
5,4,8,AMY,"Look Kif, I probably am the mother. Although maybe I'm not. Of course I hope I am but just in case I'm not, maybe we should have a test."
5,4,8,BENDER,A test. I demand a test!
5,4,8,FARNSWORTH,"Even I laughed at me when I built this alien cross species genetic analyser but I guess I showed myself! Subjects, please enter the chamber. Now to take a DNA sample. When I pull this switch the maternifuge will spin at 10,000 RPM, seperating out everyone who isn't the mother....father...whatever."
5,4,8,BENDER,Faster! Faster!
5,4,8,FARNSWORTH,Good. Fry's ejection indicates that he is not the man-mom. Nor is Captain Brannigan.
5,4,8,KIF,Oh thank you merciful God!
5,4,8,FARNSWORTH,Zoidberg?! What the hell were you doing in there?
5,4,8,ZOIDBERG,That's where I live. I have no home.
5,4,8,KIF,Amy? But that means...
5,4,8,KIF,"Leela must have impregnated me when she grabbed my ungloved hand. That explains the poster in hygiene class: No Glove, No Love."
5,4,8,LEELA,"Wow, this is all so confusing."
5,4,8,ZAPP,Leela! How could you? Our love has had to endure your constant hatred and now this? Stop testing our love!
5,4,8,KIF,"Please captain. I thank Leela for the DNA she gave me but in my species, the true parent is the one that inspired the initial feeling of love. We call that person the smizmar. And my smizmar is Amy."
5,4,8,ZAPP,So the toilet seat is like the uncle or something?
5,4,8,LEELA,Sorry I got your boyfriend pregnant.
5,4,8,AMY,"That's OK, at least Kif's baby shower should be fun. I'd better put it on my calendar. Thursday: Baby shower. Enter. Might as well plan for my new life while I'm at it. Set Motherhood Mode."
5,4,8,LEELA,To motherhood.
5,4,8,AMY,"Mom, Dad, I know this is weird but -"
5,4,8,MRS WONG,"Yeah yeah, we don't care how squishy alien get pregnant. All we care is we have grandchild now."
5,4,8,KIF,You're very open-minded Mrs Wong.
5,4,8,MR WONG,Hey! You call her grandma now!
5,4,8,MRS WONG,Call me grandma like crazy! All the time!
5,4,8,FRY,Check it out y'all. Everyone we invited is here.
5,4,8,ZOIDBERG,Also Zoidberg!
5,4,8,FRY,So lets open the gifts!
5,4,8,KIF,Lets start with this one. From Bender.
5,4,8,BENDER,It's my booties from when I was a kid.
5,4,8,AMY,"Uh, they're already bronzed."
5,4,8,BENDER,They are bronze.
5,4,8,KIF,"And this one's from Leela, oh I just love the bow! I wonder what it is!"
5,4,8,ZAPP,Yes I wonder what we got you.
5,4,8,KIF,It's a basket! F-for picnics?
5,4,8,LEELA,It means a lot to me. It's the basket my parents left me in at the Orphanarium.
5,4,8,HERMES,You could use it for picnics.
5,4,8,MRS WONG,Here Amy. We get this one for you.
5,4,8,AMY,Is it a party board?
5,4,8,MRS WONG,It's a board alright! An ironing board!
5,4,8,MR WONG,We had your old party board converted now that you not be partying anymore.
5,4,8,AMY,"You, you trashed my party board?"
5,4,8,MRS WONG,"Damn right! Now you're a mom, the only surfing you do is under a big wave of responsibilty."
5,4,8,KIF,Oh this is the happiest moment of my life! You all brought such wonderful gifts! But the greatest gift...
5,4,8,BENDER,Mine!
5,4,8,KIF,"...is the bond I share with my smizmar Amy. And soon, the quivvering mass of life within me will depend on us both. Even now I can sense it feeding, squirming, searching, questing and shortly, it will wren my loins into way and pull us down, down, down into the deep dark waters of commitment."
5,4,8,ZOIDBERG,That's so beautiful!
5,4,8,AMY (CRYING),"Yes, yes it's......no! I can't do this!"
5,4,8,BENDER,Oh my God!
5,4,8,KIF,Oh how could Amy leave me? When will women learn to take responsibilty for the children they've helped create? The quickening! My time is near. I must return to my homeworld to perform the ancient birthing rites.
5,4,8,SCRUFFY,Lemme know how that turns out.
5,4,8,KIF,I must now embark on a perilous journey. To give birth in precisely the same swamp I was born.
5,4,8,LEELA,If it's so dangerous I'd better go with you. A gal has to protect her DNA.
5,4,8,KIF,"No Leela. Tradition demands that I make this journey with my smizmar, and since Amy isn't here I must go it alone. Farewell. For we may never meet again."
5,4,8,KIF,My scrapes feel a little better now.
5,4,8,BENDER,"Hey, what's this fat ugly thing? A frog? A toad? Or your momma!"
5,4,8,KIF,It's a poisonous froad! No one move.
5,4,8,BENDER,I'm back baby!
5,4,8,KIF,Behold. The sacred ancestral birthing grounds of my family.
5,4,8,ZAPP,Smells like a jockstrap.
5,4,8,MIDWIFE,I am the Grand Midwife.
5,4,8,FRY,Hi!
5,4,8,KIF,I am Kif of the clan Kroker. I come to bear my young.
5,4,8,MIDWIFE,"Then let the Tea Of New Life be brewed. As it is written ""and both shall lift the jug together"". Where is your smizmar?"
5,4,8,KIF,She's not with me.
5,4,8,MIDWIFE,Oh the sorrow. Oh the shame. I'm sorry I'm probably just making you feel worse.
5,4,8,KIF,As long as Amy is with me in my heart I will have the strength of two. Apparently Amy hasn't been working out much lately.
5,4,8,MIDWIFE,"As the tea boils please join hands with your beloved smizmar. Oh right sorry, but I memorised the ceremony by heart and it mentions her a lot."
5,4,8,KIF,I'll try to endure.
5,4,8,MIDWIFE,Good 'cause I'm not changing it. Now turn ye to and gaze deeply into each other's eyes.
5,4,8,BENDER,What are you looking at?
5,4,8,MIDWIFE,"May the love I sense between you at this moment remain with you both for all your days. The Tea Of New Life is ready. Let those who's love created this life speak each other's names, then drink."
5,4,8,KIF,Amy.
5,4,8,AMY (SHOUTING),Kif!
5,4,8,KIF,Amy! Is it you or have I gone crazy with lonliness?
5,4,8,BENDER,Both.
5,4,8,AMY,"I still don't know if I'm ready for this but, I do know I love you. And I wanna be here beside you."
5,4,8,MIDWIFE,Great! Now I lost my place! I'm starting over!
5,4,8,KIF,Oh no time! It has begun! Oh my!
5,4,8,BENDER,Neat!
5,4,8,AMY,You can do it Kif!
5,4,8,KIF,Oh nearly!
5,4,8,BENDER,Aww man!
5,4,8,KIF,"Amy my love, tell me, are they making it to the water?"
5,4,8,LEELA,Amy!
5,4,8,AMY,Shoo! Stay away from my babies!
5,4,8,MIDWIFE,The birthing is complete!
5,4,8,KIF,Oh thank you!
5,4,8,MIDWIFE,I will now take my leave. I live here so I won't actually be going anywhere but you don't have to talk to me anymore.
5,4,8,FRY,Congratulations!
5,4,8,ZAPP,Nice work!
5,4,8,BENDER,Way to go squishy!
5,4,8,LEELA,There goes my DNA. What a disgusting and beautiful process.
5,4,8,FRY,That's birth for you.
5,4,8,KIF,Well we've given them a great start Amy. And in 20 years they'll sprout legs and crawl back onto land as children.
5,4,8,AMY,And I'll be ready then.
