5,5,0,"""LESS THAN HERO""","By Ron Weiner Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
5,5,0,SEWERCOM ANNOUNCER,Your call is being connected by SewerCom - Reach out and touch the sewers.
5,5,0,MUNDA [ON SCREEN],"Look Morris, it's Leela calling."
5,5,0,LEELA,"Hi Mom, hi Dad! Ready for your big trip to the surface?"
5,5,0,MORRIS [ON SCREEN],We're excited honey but we don't wanna embarrass you. I mean your mother and I are basically monsters.
5,5,0,LEELA,"Dad, relax. You are being so mutant!"
5,5,0,MUNDA [ON SCREEN],I found this adorable little bag to wear over my head. And it was on sale!
5,5,0,LEELA,"No one's wearing anything adorable over their head. Now listen, I could never ever be ashamed of my parents. I'll see you this weekend."
5,5,0,LEELA,"Hey, guess who I just got off the videophone with?"
5,5,0,BENDER,No.
5,5,0,LEELA,My parents! They're coming up from the sewers for a visit Sunday.
5,5,0,AMY,Are you off your rocket? Your parents are mutants. It's illegal for them to come above ground 'cause they're inferior genetic scum..uh present company excluded of course!
5,5,0,LEELA,I'm getting them a special one-day surface permit from Citihall.
5,5,0,HERMES,"Ooo, while you're there, could you pick me up a licence to kill?"
5,5,0,LEELA,Sure. Bare hands or weapon?
5,5,0,HERMES,"Uh, what does piano wire count as?"
5,5,0,FARNSWORTH,"Good news anyone, the Swedish robot from pi-kea is here with the supercollider I ordered."
5,5,0,PI-KEA ROBOT,Enjoy your affordable Swedish crap!
5,5,0,FRY,"Let's see what tools we'll need. Uh-huh, Uh-huh, Uh-huh! Alright, we're all set."
5,5,0,BENDER,Nothing like the rustic wholesomeness of working with one's own hand.
5,5,0,BENDER,"Ah, there, finished. And with only six missing pieces!"
5,5,0,FRY,Those Swedes sure know how to put in almost everything you need.
5,5,0,LEELA,"Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rouns with Mighty Thor."
5,5,0,FRY,I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.
5,5,0,ZOIDBERG,"I've got just the thing, genuine miracle cream I bought from a travelling salesman. ""Come one come all,"" he said, ""Step right up!"" This sounds too good to be true I thought. He said I looked like a smart young man. ""So is it a deal?"" I enquired. Two hours later he was gone, with 60 of my dollars. But I have the miracle cream..."
5,5,0,FARNSWORTH,"Bad news nobody, the supercollider super-exploded. I need you to take it back and exchanged it for a wobbly CD rack and some of those ransid meatballs."
5,5,0,MUGGER,Excuse me? Hi! Do you have a minute? I live in Jersey City and my car broke down and I need to get back because my Aunt's real sick and she needs this medicine but I need money for the bus. So I'm mugging you. Hand over your wallets.
5,5,0,LEELA,I don't believe that story for a second.
5,5,0,MUGGER,"It doesn't matter, I'm mugging you."
5,5,0,FRY,There's no bus to Jersey City.
5,5,0,MUGGER,Give me your wallets now or my robot'll shoot.
5,5,0,ANDREW,Don't make me hurt you.
5,5,0,FRY,"I'm too scared to find my pocket. Here, I'll just take of my pants and give you those."
5,5,0,MUGGER,Hey! I don't like what I'm seeing. Give it to him Andrew! Give it to him again Andrew! What the...? Laser proof shirts huh? I'll show you.
5,5,0,LEELA,What the? Hey! Quit it! Heyya!
5,5,0,MUGGER,Foiled. And after years of planning.
5,5,0,ANDREW,You're outta the game!
5,5,0,LEELA,How did we manage to survive? What gave us those strange powers?
5,5,0,FRY,Maybe we're all wearing magic rings but they're invisible rings so we don't even realise it. Also you can't feel the rings.
5,5,0,LEELA,"Fry, shut up and look at this! May cause superpowers in humans!"
5,5,0,FRY,Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub into your skin? You'd think it'd be something you have to freebase.
5,5,0,LEELA,"Let's see, which powers do we have? Super-strength?"
5,5,0,FRY,Yup.
5,5,0,LEELA,Uh-huh. Lickety speed?
5,5,0,FRY,Check.
5,5,0,LEELA,Yes sir! Ability to command a loyalty of sea creatures?
5,5,0,FRY (SHOUTING),"Hey Zoidberg, get in here!"
5,5,0,LEELA,Ain't got that.
5,5,0,FRY,Nope!
5,5,0,LEELA,"Wow, superpowers! I'll be able to pack my day with twice as many humdrum activity."
5,5,0,FRY,"Leela, I think you're missing the big picture. When you were a kid what was your biggest fantasy?"
5,5,0,LEELA,To have parents.
5,5,0,FRY,Whatever. The correct answer is: To be a superhero. We have superpowers and we're Americans. This is our chance.
5,5,0,LEELA,"Hmm, I have been looking for a way to serve the community that incorporates my violence. Let's do it!"
5,5,0,FRY,You'll barely regret this!
5,5,0,BENDER,"Hey, a friend of mine said he mugged you today and you had superpowers."
5,5,0,LEELA,It's true. Thanks to this funky fresh cream.
5,5,0,FRY,Now me and Leela are forming an awesome crime-fighting duo.
5,5,0,BENDER,"Wow, crime-fighting. Cool. You say you're a duo? Yeah duos are good. Of course sometimes they're a little short handed. See ya. With two humans you'd think there'd be a robot in there...to balance things out. But, whatever. I have these three costumes you could use. But, I guess I'll just throw one away."
5,5,0,LEELA,We'd love to have you on the team Bender. But aren't you more on the supply side of crime?
5,5,0,FRY,"Plus the cream won't give you superpowers, you're a robot."
5,5,0,BENDER,So? I'm already super-strong. And my arms do this. Also I got this going.
5,5,0,LEELA (SHOUTING),Listen up New New York! There's a new group of superheros in town! And we're
5,5,0,LEELA,Sorry! A new era of justice has begun.
5,5,0,FRY,Captain Yesterday!
5,5,0,LEELA,Clobberella!
5,5,0,BENDER,And Superking! The best one of the three!
5,5,0,FRY,Wow!
5,5,0,SONG,"Go Go New Justice Team,"
5,5,0,,">Go team, go team, team team team,"
5,5,0,,"Who's the newest Justice Team, The New Justice Team!"
5,5,0,,"Captain Yesterday is fast, Also he is from the past, Not just fast but from the past..."
5,5,0,,He runs ahead to the end of the tube.]
5,5,0,,...Captain Yesterday!
5,5,0,,"Superking has the power, 'Cause all the kings have all the power, All the power of Superman, Also he's a robot, ain't it cool? Superking you rule!"
5,5,0,SONG,"Clobberella beats you up, Clobberella beats you up! Who does she beat up? You!"
5,5,0,,Clobberella!
5,5,0,SONG,"Citizens never fear, Crazy do-good freaks are here, Until they run out of steam..."
5,5,0,,"...Miracle cream, miracle cream, Gives the power to the team!"
5,5,0,,"It's effects wear off for sure, So they just slop on some more. The New Justice Team!"
5,5,0,BENDER,Ta-da!
5,5,0,WOMAN (SEXFULLY),"Captain Yesterday, I find your skintight highwaters incredibly sexy! Let's get together sometime!"
5,5,0,FRY,Sure. I'm listed in the phone book so once I reveal my real name to you along with my home address and a copy of my birth certificate -
5,5,0,LEELA,Are you crazy?? We have to keep our secret identities secret.
5,5,0,FRY,From everybody?
5,5,0,LEELA,Especially from everybody.
5,5,0,FRY,Give several reasons why.
5,5,0,LEELA,"For one, superheroes cause a lot of collateral damage, and we don't wanna get our butts sued."
5,5,0,FRY,Or do we...? No I guess not.
5,5,0,LEELA,"Also, if our identities get out, every crook in the city will be after us. Or, God forbid, our loved ones."
5,5,0,BENDER,Superking has no need for loved ones. How ya doin' kid?
5,5,0,POOPENMEYER,There you go. Two one-day mutant surface passes.
5,5,0,LEELA,Thank you Mayor Poopenmeyer.
5,5,0,POOPENMEYER,Mayor here...what's that? Horrible crime in the works? Ruthless villain? Citizens in danger? That's fantastic news! Because I get to summon The New Justice Team!
5,5,0,LEELA,Shh!
5,5,0,POOPENMEYER,"Uh, they're usually here by now."
5,5,0,LEELA,"Well, so long. Keep in touch."
5,5,0,POOPENMEYER,"Wait, stay and meet the superheroes. There's three of you and three of them so it'll be perfect. Is this clown on? Where are those daring crimestoppers?"
5,5,0,LEELA,"Oh, I completely forgot, I left my apartment on fire!"
5,5,0,BENDER,"Uh, as for me, I'm late for my LSAT's."
5,5,0,FRY,And I can't take life anymore.
5,5,0,POOPENMEYER,Clobberella! Captain Yesterday! My liege! You're just in time! We've received a tip that the Museum of Natural History will be robbed tomorrow at exactly 9am. The target: The priceless Quantum Gemerald!
5,5,0,FRY,Who's the perp?
5,5,0,POOPENMEYER,"A dangerous villain know as The Zookeeper, who commits crimes aided by a pack of highly trained animals."
5,5,0,FRY,Pack of highly. Got it!
5,5,0,POOPENMEYER,"His crew includes a badger with a troubled past and nothing left to lose, an elephant who never forgets - to kill! And a seldom used crab named Lucky aka Citizen Snips."
5,5,0,LEELA,You can count on us Mr Mayor! Justice away!
5,5,0,BENDER (GASPING),Hold the elevator!
5,5,0,BENDER,We're in here too.
5,5,0,FRY,"Uh, Leela, how you gonna meet your folks tomorrow? We've already scheduled the Zookeeper for a 9am foiling at the museum."
5,5,0,LEELA,Not a problem. I've cleverly arranged to meet my parents right there at the same museum at 10.
5,5,0,BENDER,"9, 10 a big fat hen. The name...Bender!"
5,5,0,LEELA,I can't believe the Zookeeper is this late for his own heist. It's just rude! Total hell! It's 10! I'm supposed to meet my parents and I'm still in my secret costume! There they are!
5,5,0,MUNDA,How could Leela not be here? Do you think she forgot?
5,5,0,MORRIS,Relax. I'm sure she's just ashamed of us.
5,5,0,SECURITY GUARD,Yo! Freakjobs! Hit the nearest manhole! Pronto like.
5,5,0,MORRIS,But we have passes that allow us to be up here. From the mayor himself.
5,5,0,SECURITY GUARD,I dunno...I never heard of no mayor.
5,5,0,RANDY,The Zookeeper!
5,5,0,ZOOKEEPER,"Sorry I'm late, long story. Now everybody hit the deck! I'm cutting the entire line and stealing the exhibit."
5,5,0,LEELA,You're not stealing anything! Nobody hit the deck!
5,5,0,ZOOKEEPER,"Ah, superheroes! Or should I say superzeroes!"
5,5,0,FRY (SADLY),That was uncalled for.
5,5,0,ZOOKEEPER,"Animals, attack."
5,5,0,TOUR GUIDE,Please to not feed the animals!
5,5,0,BENDER,You're going down my friend! Down Under!
5,5,0,TEDDY ROOSEVELT,Man boxing a kangaroo is a peculiar spectacle. But a kangaroo boxing a robot? Now I'm afraid you've lost me! Citizen Snips!
5,5,0,ZOOKEEPER,Nice job Fingers!
5,5,0,MUNDA,I'm scared and confused. I think we've wandered into an off-Broadway play.
5,5,0,MORRIS,No there are way too many people here.
5,5,0,ZOOKEEPER,"Later, if anyone asks how I got away, tell them right now!"
5,5,0,LEELA,Forget it Zookeeper! You're going into captivity!
5,5,0,ZOOKEEPER,Fool! A quip without putting me behind bars would have been far more delicious! Here catch!
5,5,0,LEELA,"No, Fry you can't fall fast enough!"
5,5,0,BENDER,I got it I got it! I don't got it!
5,5,0,TEDDY ROOSEVELT,You've saved the Gemerald!
5,5,0,FRY,Yet the Zookeeper escaped. Thus proving that the deadliest animal of all is the Zookeeper!
5,5,0,BENDER,You can get off me anytime.
5,5,0,LEELA,Oh no! My parents are leaving! I've gotta go change back into street-Leela.
5,5,0,POOPENMEYER,Thank you mysterious heroes. The value of the Gemerald you saved is slightly greater than the cost of the damage you caused to this museum. A net gain for our great city!
5,5,0,MUNDA,It's good that Leela doesn't love us. She'll be less sad when we die.
5,5,0,LEELA,Mom? Dad? I showed up! And I got the audio tour for Treasures Of Liberachi's Tomb!
5,5,0,MORRIS,"Sweetie, it's OK. You don't have to apologise for standing us up on the only visit to the surface we'll ever have."
5,5,0,LEELA,I wanna tell you why I didn't show up. But I can't. Just please believe me that it was a very good reason. I'm sorry I disappointed you.
5,5,0,MUNDA,"Leela, you could never disappoint us."
5,5,0,MORRIS,We're so proud of everything that you are. And we always will be. You're our baby girl.
5,5,0,LEELA,"Oh, I can't take it! Mom, Dad, I'm Clobberella!"
5,5,0,MORRIS,Galloping gators!
5,5,0,MUNDA,You're a superhero? Well that's wonderful! But did you have to make the costume so revealing?
5,5,0,MORRIS,Look at me! Proud dad of a superhero! We should print up T-Shirts! And F-Shirts for our friends with two arms on the same side!
5,5,0,LEELA,"No, listen. It's very important that you never ever tell anyone. Under any circumstance."
5,5,0,MORRIS,What if I've had a few?
5,5,0,LEELA,"Dad, you drink? No. Not even then."
5,5,0,MORRIS,Alright. My sucker is sealed.
5,5,0,LEELA,"In fact, I shouldn't even be wearing this around here. It was brisk, I dressed in layers."
5,5,0,MUNDA,That's my girl!
5,5,0,MORRIS,"So uh, anyway, my daughter's Clobberella."
5,5,0,RAOUL,Leela is Clobberella?
5,5,0,LEG MUTANT,You're pulling me!
5,5,0,MORRIS,"Shh, keep it under your sock. It's a big secret. That's why I'm only telling you two."
5,5,1,BIG EARED MUTANT,Oh my God! That guy's daughter is Clobberella! But don't tell anyone.
5,5,1,BIG MOUTHED MUTANT,Gotcha!
5,5,1,FARNSWORTH,"I don't remember much buddy, and you're no looker!"
5,5,1,LEELA,"Uh Professor, isn't it time for your nap?"
5,5,1,FARNSWORTH,Yes dammit!
5,5,1,LEELA,Zookeeper! How did you know our real identities?
5,5,1,PARROT [ON SCREEN],Leela told her parents. Leela's parents blabbed.
5,5,1,FRY,"Leela, is the person that parrot is mimicking telling the truth by proxy?"
5,5,1,LEELA (SADLY),"Yes. My parents were so hurt, I couldn't help it! But I distinctly told them not to tell anyone."
5,5,1,BENDER,We are not amused.
5,5,1,LEELA,Mom! Dad!
5,5,1,MUNDA [ON SCREEN],Leela please forgive us! Especially your father who's the one who told thank you very much Morris.
5,5,1,LEELA,Are you alright? Has he hurt you?
5,5,1,MORRIS [ON SCREEN],No but my allergies are going nuts. Oh God!
5,5,1,MUNDA [ON SCREEN],Every couch and table has animal fur all over it. He lets them climb on everything!
5,5,1,LEELA,"Alright Zookeeper, what do you want?"
5,5,1,MUNDA [ON SCREEN],Save us Leela! I mean...if you don't have anything better to do.
5,5,1,LEELA,We're out of options. We have to steal the Gemerald!
5,5,1,FRY,"But, should superheroes commit crime? Even to save lives? I need moral guidance. Bender?"
5,5,1,BENDER,"Hmm, the thought of stealing anythig fills Superking with disgust. But if it must be so, then let a museum heist be pulled!"
5,5,1,FRY,Oh no! Our superpower cream is out of itself!
5,5,1,LEELA,Check inside the cap! There might be a caked in goldmine!
5,5,1,FRY,El zilcho! I'm afraid we're boned.
5,5,1,BENDER,El zilcho...is it too late to change my superhero name?
5,5,1,LEELA,Just be cool. Nobody knows we're superpowerly challenged.
5,5,1,FRY,"Man, this costume is so damn heavy!"
5,5,1,KID,"Hey Captain Yesterday, can I like, wail on you with this 2x4 and it doesn't hurt you?"
5,5,1,FRY,Owww! That...didn't hurt.
5,5,1,SECURITY GUARD,"Hi superheroes, everything OK?"
5,5,1,LEELA,"Big O, little k my friend! Just checking if everything's alright!"
5,5,1,SECURITY GUARD,It's OK alright!
5,5,1,LEELA,
5,5,1,BUBBLEGUM TATE,"Yo, the superheroes have turned evil! Most uncool!"
5,5,1,SECURITY GUARD,Get 'em!
5,5,1,LEELA,"Stay back! Or we'll, beat the tour out of you...using superpowers!"
5,5,2,FRY,So this is your lair?
5,5,2,ZOOKEEPER,Of course not. You think I'd show you my lair? My lair's a million times nicer than this!
5,5,2,FRY,
5,5,2,BENDER,"Well, here's your lousy Gemerald."
5,5,2,ZOOKEEPER,Hawk! Fetch!
5,5,2,FRY,That seemed unnecessary.
5,5,2,ZOOKEEPER,"Our transaction is complete. Come Solomon, to the lair."
5,5,2,LEELA,"Mom, Dad, oh I'm so sorry I got you kidnapped by a crazy madman who tried to feed you to pirhanas."
5,5,2,MUNDA,We're just happy to be involved in your life.
5,5,2,LEELA,"No no, it's my fault for telling you I was a superhero."
5,5,2,MORRIS,That's true.
5,5,2,LEELA,I just couldn't stand to have you to think I was ashamed of you.
5,5,2,MUNDA,"That's OK sweetie, but, it's natural for children to be a little ashamed of their parents."
5,5,2,FRY,Oh yeah!
5,5,2,MORRIS,Just like it's natural for parents to be a little disappointed in their children...n-not that we are.
5,5,2,MUNDA,But you could call a little more often.
5,5,2,OK.,
5,5,2,MUNDA,And would it kill you to use some mouthwash?
5,5,2,BENDER,Hey Fry we've still got our costumes on. Wanna steal some more stuff?
5,5,2,FRY,"I guess, as long as you think it's right."
5,5,2,BENDER,Superheroes away!
5,5,2,SONG,"Go go go New Justice Team! Fighting justice is their quest! Superking, Clobberella, and the rest! Here's to you New Justice Team, Do the things that make your team, Help each other, do some things! Winners don't use drugs! The New Justice Team!"
