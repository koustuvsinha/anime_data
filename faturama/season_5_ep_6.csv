5,6,0,"""TEENAGE MUTANT LEELA'S HURDLES""","By Jeff Westbrook Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
5,6,1,FARNSWORTH,Pazuzu you ungrateful gargoyle! I put you through college and this is how you repay me?
5,6,1,FARNSWORTH,"Let's get this gargoyle hunt on the road. Driving gloves, driving goggles. Driving thong. There."
5,6,1,LEELA,"Uh, maybe I should drive."
5,6,1,FARNSWORTH,You? A woman? I'm trying to catch a monster not find the quickest route to the mall! Let me just adjust the seat.
5,6,1,FRY,"My God, he's gonna do it! Everybody, seatbelts to maximum buckling."
5,6,1,RANDY [FROM HIS CAR],"Hey grandpa, move your wrinkly old kiester!"
5,6,2,LEELA,For heaven's gate Professor this ship can do 99% light speed. Why are we going at 35 miles an hour?
5,6,2,FARNSWORTH,Because we're in a hurry that's why.
5,6,2,LEELA,Plus you have the highbeams on!
5,6,3,BENDER,"Yo, Captain Cateracts, what are we doing here?"
5,6,3,FARNSWORTH,"Oh it's 2:30, we can still catch the early bird dinner special."
5,6,3,FRY,"Uh, aren't we looking for your gargoyle?"
5,6,3,FARNSWORTH,My wha?
5,6,3,FARNSWORTH,Hello Mavis! Surprised to see me back again so soon?
5,6,3,WANDA,Mavis is dead.
5,6,3,FARNSWORTH,I expect you'll want to see my angry crotchety grandpa discount card!
5,6,3,WANDA,Sir this card is expired.
5,6,3,FARNSWORTH,But it's good for a lifetime.
5,6,3,WANDA,Well yours expired.
5,6,4,LEELA,Oh Lord! Teeth do not belong in your pants Professor.
5,6,4,FARNSWORTH,Well I can't keep them in my mouth. They're nuclear powered!
5,6,4,FRY,Ow! It bit me!
5,6,4,LEELA,No! No! It's tasted human blood!
5,6,4,FARNSWORTH,Mmm! Damn good meat!
5,6,4,LEELA,Professor we've talked it over and everyone thinks you're too old.
5,6,4,AMY,Right on.
5,6,4,FRY,Yup.
5,6,4,BENDER,Uh huh!
5,6,4,HERMES,We've decided to do the merciful thing and have you Youthasized.
5,6,4,FARNSWORTH,Dear God no!
5,6,4,AMY,"Oh relax Professor. Youthasizing is a trendy new spa treatment, its this seasons shark cartilage enema."
5,6,4,FARNSWORTH,"But I like being old. I don't have to talk to my parents, no one asks me to help move their stuff, I don't need to understand today's ""edgy TV sitcoms."""
5,6,4,LEELA,
5,6,4,FARNSWORTH,My thong!
5,6,4,HEATHER,"Hi, I'm Heather your personal Youthasizer! Lets get started with a nice botulism treatment shall we?"
5,6,4,FARNSWORTH,Go to hell Heather!
5,6,4,HEATHER,Oh! In small doses botchelism toxin tightens and tones the facial muscles instead of killing you in the most horrible fashion imaginable.
5,6,4,FARNSWORTH,Give me back my floppy face!
5,6,4,FARNSWORTH,Careful with the giblets!
5,6,4,HEATHER,"Hmm, you're still retaining a lot of grump in these joints. More pressure."
5,6,4,FARNSWORTH,Ahh!
5,6,4,HEATHER,"Since this is such a serious case of old, we'll have to try our strongest treatment. A soothing full body bath in searing hot tar. Sir, its not neccesary or wise to be naked."
5,6,4,FARNSWORTH,You sound just like my tennis instructor.
5,6,4,HEATHER,The tar blisters the age right out of the body in what top scientists suspect is a miracle.
5,6,4,FARNSWORTH,"Oh I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain."
5,6,4,FRY,He still sounds sorta old. Sorta real old.
5,6,4,BENDER,"Step aside lady. Like everything else in life, pumping is just a primative degenerate form of bending. C'mon Bender pump harder! Harder! I'm trying as hard as I can. Harder damn you!"
5,6,4,FARNSWORTH,Well that was an utter waste of time.
5,6,4,AMY,Professor it worked! You look young enough to be my father!
5,6,4,FARNSWORTH,Poodlespit! 53 years old? Now I'll need a fake ID to rent ultra-porn.
5,6,4,FRY,This is great Professor! We should go out and celebrate!
5,6,4,FARNSWORTH,"Dear Lord, you've all reverted to your childhood forms!"
5,6,4,ZOIDBERG,Hooray! I'm a teenage hearthrob again!
5,6,4,FARNSWORTH,"While I try to restore our normal ages, I expect you all to go about your jobs like normal professionals."
5,6,4,HERMES,"It wasn't me Mr F, it was Amy! Stop it Amy!"
5,6,4,AMY,You stink!
5,6,4,HERMES,You know you did it!
5,6,4,FARNSWORTH,Quiet! Quiet I say!
5,6,4,LABARBARA,"We're here to take my little stub of a husband home. Hermes, say goodbye to Mr Farnsworth."
5,6,4,HERMES,Goodbye Mr Dumbsworth!
5,6,4,LEELA,"Hey, this my chance to spend time with my parents too!"
5,6,4,FRY,But your parents are gross sewer mutants.
5,6,4,LEELA,"When I was an orphan I always wished I could grow up with my mom and dad. And now, thanks to being hurled backwards through time -"
5,6,4,FARNSWORTH,That's not what happened! Shut up and go live with your parents.
5,6,5,LEELA,"It's gonna be totally awesome mom! You and me can bake and argue about my hairstyle hiding my pretty face. And if some kid picks on me, my dad can beat up his dad."
5,6,5,MORRIS,Can't I just beat up the kid?
5,6,5,MUNDA,"Well OK Leela, if you think you can put up with your father, welcome home. We'll try to respect your independence and your freedom."
5,6,5,LEELA,"No! I want the real teen experience! Chores, curfew, the works!"
5,6,5,MORRIS,"Fine Leela we'll be the strictest parents ever. Now, lets all have some tequila to celebrate!"
5,6,5,LEELA,Dad I'm underage!
5,6,5,MORRIS,Oh right. Here's a silly straw.
5,6,5,MRS WONG,Oh my Amy's sweet little girl again. This like a mother's dream. Bad dream that is! At this rate I'm never going to get a grandchild!
5,6,5,MR WONG,Maybe she not grown up but she sure grown out! She fat!
5,6,5,AMY,"Dad, if you're gonna make fat jokes until I get cute again I'm just gonna stay in my room."
5,6,5,MR WONG,Stay in room? You so fat you gonna stay all around room!
5,6,5,FARNSWORTH,I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth! Suddenly I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork every three hours! And those jerks at social security stopped sending me cheques! Now I have to pay them!
5,6,5,BENDER,"I'm tired of your yapping. All you ever do is complain, you never try to make things better. Well I'm running away from this dead end family! I know there's a place for people like me with new ideas. There has to be!"
5,6,5,FARNSWORTH,"Fine, get going!"
5,6,5,BENDER,"Oh I'm going! You're gonna be all ""Where's Bender? I miss Bender!"""
5,6,5,FARNSWORTH,We won't know that until you leave.
5,6,5,BENDER,"Oh, I'm leaving!"
5,6,5,FARNSWORTH,There's the door.
5,6,5,BENDER,I'll be good.
5,6,5,MUNDA,"Ah, do you have to shed your skin on the couch? What do we live in, a zoo?"
5,6,5,MORRIS,I'm getting the doorbell. For me?
5,6,5,FRY,"Oh, hello sir. It's a lovely evening you have tonight. Um I'm here to pick up your daughter."
5,6,5,LEELA,Hi Fry! I like your blazer.
5,6,5,FRY,Thanks. These aren't pockets they're just flaps. I put my money in my sock.
5,6,5,MUNDA,"So, where are you taking my daughter tonight?"
5,6,5,FRY,A movie. A movie ma'am.
5,6,5,MORRIS,"Well whatever you're really doing, don't wake us if you get in after 12."
5,6,5,LEELA,"Dad, you're being too leaneant again! I have to be back by 11."
5,6,5,MUNDA,
5,6,5,LEELA,No I'm not!
5,6,5,FRY,I'd like a sewer burger but without the rat feces.
5,6,5,LEELA,What are you on a diet?
5,6,5,MOOSE,Uh Leela you look hot!
5,6,5,MANDY,"Jeez Moose, just dump me right in front of her why don't you!"
5,6,5,LEELA,"Moose, Mandy, this is my friend Fry - from the surface!"
5,6,5,MANDY,Oh so this is the famous Fry! What is he like the biggest loser on the surface so he has to hang out in the sewer?
5,6,5,FRY (WHISPERING),They're onto me.
5,6,5,LEELA,"Hey come on, let's act like grown ups here! Wanna race?"
5,6,5,MOOSE,Uh yeah!
5,6,6,SAL,Theres. The worlds drinkings water is safes for another days. Whoas! Cripe!
5,6,7,LEELA,A tapeworm!
5,6,7,FRY,"We missed the turn, we'll never catch them."
5,6,7,LEELA,Yes we will. This sewer goes right under Planet Express and its's 9pm!
5,6,9,FRY,Yeah!
5,6,9,LEELA,All right!
5,6,9,FRY,"Leela you can stop winning now, we won!"
5,6,9,LEELA,I'm too short to reach the handbrake!
5,6,10,DWAYNE,That's detention!
5,6,10,FRY,"And then, and then, this giant tapeworm tried to play us for chumps but we like totally dissed Moose!"
5,6,10,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, I'd like to meet this ""moose."" But in the meantime I have good news. I may have solved our age problem."
5,6,10,FRY,Yay!
5,6,10,FARNSWORTH,"It seems the Youthasizer tar was saturated with time-altering chronitons. A thin layer is still stuck to our DNA as well as Bender's Robot DNA or ""RNA."""
5,6,10,BENDER,Question.
5,6,10,FARNSWORTH,Yes?
5,6,10,BENDER,You stink!
5,6,10,FARNSWORTH,Yes yes. Anyhow I've designed an oil eating bacterium that should take the tar right off.
5,6,10,FRY,C'mon! Lets go tell Leela so we can grow up together!
5,6,10,LEELA,Thanks Professor but I don't want the treatment.
5,6,10,FARNSWORTH,"Don't you understand you little nitwit? Unless you're treated soon, the only way to restore your true age would be to grow into it! Just as God intended."
5,6,10,MUNDA,He has a point honey. What about your job and your friends? Do you really want to abandon your old life?
5,6,10,LEELA,My old life wasn't as glamourous as my webpage made it look. All I ever wanted was to grow up here. With you. Please?
5,6,10,MUNDA,Well if it's what you really want.
5,6,10,LEELA,It is. I know it is.
5,6,10,FRY,I'll miss you Leela. I'll come ack and visit when I'm all grown up.
5,6,10,LEELA (WHISPERING),Bring beer.
5,6,10,MORRIS,No beer 'til you finish your tequila!
5,6,10,AMY,Let's go!
5,6,11,FARNSWORTH,Initiating controlled infection.
5,6,11,ZOIDBERG,I'm no doctor but this machine guy could use a lozenge.
5,6,11,AMY,Aw poo! We're even younger!
5,6,11,FARNSWORTH,"Damn! the bacteria pigged out on the tar and now they're getting freaky deaky, spreading chronitons throughout our systems. We're getting younger by the minute!"
5,6,11,ZOIDBERG,What I'm going to revrt through all my larval stages?
5,6,11,FARNSWORTH,Word! We'll all keep getting younger and younger until we suffer a fate worse than death - pre-life! Then death.
5,6,11,FARNSWORTH,I've got to stop this reverse aging before we all shrivel up and suffer the agony of unbirth. Think you disco duck think!
5,6,11,AMY,What's that squirming under your shirt?
5,6,11,FARNSWORTH,Get off me you parasitic lamprey!
5,6,11,ZOIDBERG,Oh sure like you need all your blood.
5,6,11,FARNSWORTH,Would you all chill! I can't think with you kids cramping my style! Oh I need a babysitter!
5,6,11,LEELA,
5,6,11,ZOIDBERG,I can't see from down here I can't.
5,6,11,LEELA,There. Todays story is from New Teen magazine. What would you rather hear about? Four legged Chachi or tentacled Chachi?
5,6,11,FRY,I wanna hear a space story!
5,6,11,LEELA,"It's kind of a baby book. But OK. Let's see. Snow White Dwarf And The Seven Red Dwarves, Charlotte's Tholian Web, The Fountain Of Aging."
5,6,11,FARNSWORTH,"The Fountain Of Aging? Hmm, it is just a legend. Still, they called the Tooth Fairy a legend and now it's head of the FBI."
5,6,11,FARNSWORTH,Sup? Kids ready?
5,6,11,FRY,"Professy's back! Eww, you smell like smoking. And drinking."
5,6,11,FARNSWORTH,I had a few beers but I'm cool to drive.
5,6,11,LEELA,"I wish I could come with you to say goodbye, before you all turn back in to grown ups but I'm grounded for knocking the school over."
5,6,11,MUNDA,"Who cares Leela? It was just a public school. Now go with your friends, please."
5,6,11,LEELA,No! A grounded teenager must be confined to her room!
5,6,11,LEELA,...until she sneaks out!
5,6,11,BENDER,When I grow up I wanna be a steam shovel!
5,6,11,LEELA,"According to this, the fountain is located within the darkest, most ancient region of space, just past teddybear junction."
5,6,11,FARNSWORTH,"Teddybear junction, the worst scum hole in the galaxy."
5,6,11,FARNSWORTH,This solar system is like way old.
5,6,11,LEELA,Look how high the asteroid belt is pulled up on that planet.
5,6,11,FARNSWORTH,Newsflash! Everything's getting older the closer we get to that sun!
5,6,11,LEELA,"Dude, the Fountain Of Aging must be on the sun itself!"
5,6,11,FARNSWORTH,Shut up! I was gonna say that!
5,6,11,LEELA,We've got to hurry. The kids have only one change of pants!
5,6,11,FARNSWORTH,We gotta be real real careful to stay in just long enough to make us our right ages again.
5,6,11,FARNSWORTH,Zoidberg! Get out of there!
5,6,11,ZOIDBERG,"The current, its too much already! Help!"
5,6,11,FARNSWORTH,Jeepers!
5,6,11,LEELA,Zoidberg is dead!
5,6,11,ZOIDBERG,No! Zoidberg's brother is dead! funny story. I just reverted to the age where my siblings budded from me and my brother Norman split off and jumped in the fountain.
5,6,11,SIBLING,He always had to be the centre of attention!
5,6,11,LEELA,Oh no! Quick! Get them into the fountain!
5,6,11,FARNSWORTH,Thanks for the help Weewa. Once we're gwown up you can go back to your famiwy. We'wl never bother you again.
5,6,11,LEELA,You can bother me a little.
5,6,11,FARNSWORTH,It's working! Hooray! I can't hold on!
5,6,11,LEELA,I'm coming in after you!
5,6,11,FARNSWORTH,No Leela! You can't give up your childhood! You'll never have another chance at it!
5,6,11,FRY,We did it! We're the right ages again!
5,6,11,LEELA,I think I might be a couple years younger.
5,6,11,AMY,"Oh, me too!"
5,6,11,LEELA,He's too far out! We can't reach him!
5,6,11,HERMES,Are you back to your original age Professor?
5,6,11,FARNSWORTH,Even older! Huzzah!
5,6,11,FRY,I'm sorry you had to give up being a kid Leela.
5,6,11,LEELA,"Well, I guess ever adult wants to be a kid sometimes. But I worked hard to be the person I am!"
5,6,11,FRY,The fabulous person!
5,6,11,LEELA,With friends like you guys -
5,6,11,FRY,Fabulous friends!
5,6,11,LEELA,And I'm really happy I have that life back.
5,6,11,FARNSWORTH,And you my faithful fiend! How can I ever repay you?
