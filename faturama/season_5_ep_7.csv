5,7,0,"""THE WHY OF FRY""","By David X. Cohen Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
5,7,0,FRY,Delivery boy Philip J. Fry reporting for duty.
5,7,0,ZOIDBERG,"Dr Zoidberg, soaking in brine."
5,7,0,FRY,"What is the meaning of this? We've got a delivery people, let's move, let's move! Amy? Mission profile? Interesting, interesting. Dr Zoidberg, mission bag?"
5,7,0,ZOIDBERG,Packed and ready sir.
5,7,0,FRY,What's this? This is the same toy surprise I got last time! I can't work under these conditions. And without me there is no mission. I am the mission!
5,7,0,LEELA (SHOUTING),We're back from the mission!
5,7,0,FRY,Wh-what? You went without me?
5,7,0,BENDER (SHOUTING),You were looking up curse words in the dictionary. It seemed like a better use of your time.
5,7,0,FRY,"But, but I'm the delivery boy."
5,7,0,LEELA,"Don't worry, everything went fine."
5,7,0,BENDER,Better than usual!
5,7,0,LEELA,We got medals! Good work team! We really pulled together on this one.
5,7,0,BENDER,Woo-hoo!
5,7,0,FRY,I'm real sorry I missed the mission. I wasn't there and you might have needed me.
5,7,0,BENDER,Nope.
5,7,0,FRY,But if I'd been there I -
5,7,0,BENDER,Nope.
5,7,0,L -,
5,7,0,BENDER,Nope.
5,7,0,FRY,Bender's great.
5,7,0,BENDER,Nope! Ohh!
5,7,0,FRY,"Listen Leela, let me make it up by taking you out to dinner tonight."
5,7,0,LEELA,Nope. I've got a date with Chaz.
5,7,0,FRY,Chaz?
5,7,0,LEELA,I met him at that charity cock fight last week. He's the mayor's aide.
5,7,0,BENDER,"Ooo, you go mutant girl!"
5,7,0,LEELA,I do go! He's a very important man.
5,7,0,FRY,"So? I'm just as important as him. It's just that, the kind of importance I have, it doesn't matter if I...don't do it."
5,7,0,FRY,I'm nobody. There are guys in the background with Mary Worth comics who are more important than me.
5,7,0,BENDER,"Ah, buck up meatloaf. Bender'll take you out tonight and cheer you up. What do you wanna do? And I mean anything. You have the power! Name it an I'm there, you the man!"
5,7,0,FRY,"Um, OK. Let's go bowling."
5,7,0,BENDER,Nah.
5,7,0,ELZAR,Table for two? Step right this way.
5,7,0,CHAZ,"I'm afraid we don't have a reservation but uh, as you can see......I'm the mayor's aide. Table for two please."
5,7,0,ELZAR,
5,7,1,ELZAR,Bam!
5,7,1,CHAZ,It's OK my man. I got you covered on your next health inspection.
5,7,1,ELZAR,"I really appreciate that mister mayor's aide. Here you go, compliments of the house."
5,7,1,LEELA,"Wow, free bread at a restaurant? Is there anything you can't do?"
5,7,1,CHAZ,"I can't fail the mayor, not ever."
5,7,1,FRY,"Oh jeez, better not let Leela see me."
5,7,1,LEELA,"Hey, I hear Fry. Boy am I glad you're here!"
5,7,1,FRY,You are? So things aren't working out with whatshisname?
5,7,1,LEELA,"Actually...they are! Confidentially, I might not make it back to my apartment tonight! Could you walk Nibbler for me?"
5,7,1,FRY,Um..uh...
5,7,1,LEELA,And bring a baggy in case he drops a steamer. Have a great night!
5,7,1,FRY,"Oh no, please, no! Perfect!"
5,7,1,SMITTY,"Whoa, smells like a 289 in progress!"
5,7,1,URL,"Failure to scoop, aw yeah!"
5,7,1,FRY,"Wait, I'm trying. It weighs as much as a thousand suns!"
5,7,1,CHAZ,"Don't worry Fry, I'll pull some strings. See if I can't get you tried as a juvenile!"
5,7,1,LEELA,Oh Chaz!
5,7,1,FRY,I'm as worthless as this trashcan.
5,7,1,TRASHCAN,You think I'm as worthless as you? Try catching garbage in your head and raising six kids you dumb townie!
5,7,1,FRY,"Oh Nibbler, at least I'm important to you. Even if it's only 'cause I clean up you poop."
5,7,1,NIBBLER,The poop eradication is but one aspect of your importance.
5,7,1,FRY,D-d-did you just talk?
5,7,1,NIBBLER,Indeed. And I have other amazing powers as well.
5,7,1,FRY,Like what?
5,7,1,FRY,Are you my mommy?
5,7,1,NIBBLER,Negative.
5,7,2,FIONA,Welcome Lord Nibbler.
5,7,2,NIBBLER,Welcome acknowledged. I bring with me...the Mighty One.
5,7,2,FRY,Eh?
5,7,2,KEN,"At last, our centuries upon centuries of waiting have achieved fruition."
5,7,2,FRY,"Aww, aren't you a fuzzy wittle guy?"
5,7,2,KEN,Stop that! Uh...please. Your mightiness
5,7,2,FRY,Mightiness? Are you off your nut? I just got kidnapped by a bunch of guineapigs.
5,7,2,KEN,Does he not know?
5,7,2,NIBBLER,He does not know.
5,7,2,FIONA,He knows not?
5,7,2,NIBBLER,Knows not does he.
5,7,2,NIBBLONIAN,Not he knows?
5,7,2,KEN,"Enough! Fry, it is my duty to inform you that the fate of humanity, the fate of our race, indeed the fate of all that exists and all that will exist rests with you. You are the single most important person in the universe."
5,7,2,FRY,Oh snap!
5,7,2,NIBBLER,"On this auspicious occasion, let the Hall Of Eternity cut a thunderous blast."
5,7,2,FIONA,The Feast Of A Thousand Beasts is begun.
5,7,2,NIBBLONIAN,You gonna eat that?
5,7,2,FRY,Maybe later.
5,7,2,KEN,The time has come to discuss matters of the gravest importance.
5,7,2,NIBBLER,"Fry, do you remember some months ago when the Earth was attacked by flying brains?"
5,7,2,FRY,"Hmm, I remember the square dancing stomachs, although that might have been a milanta commerical. Wait! The brains! I do remember! But no one else does. They said I was crazy."
5,7,2,KEN,On the contrary. You remember beause you were the only one immune to the brain's mental attack.
5,7,2,FRY,Because I'm so smart?
5,7,2,KEN,"Oh my. Anyway, your immunity is due to the fact that you lack the delta brainwave. It's a genetic abnormality which resulted when you went back in time and performed certain actions which made you your own grandfather."
5,7,2,FRY,I did do the nasty in the pasty!
5,7,2,NIBBLER,Verily. And that past nastification is what shields you from the brains. You are the last hope of the universe.
5,7,2,FRY,So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?
5,7,2,KEN,Yes. Except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.
5,7,2,KEN,"For a thousand years, the evil brains have been constructing the giant Infosphere, a giant memory bank twice the size of three ordinary memory banks."
5,7,2,FRY,What's so evil about that?
5,7,2,FIONA,They plan to collect all the information in the universe and store it in the sphere.
5,7,2,FRY,So they're trying to learn things?
5,7,2,FIONA,Right.
5,7,2,FRY,Those bastards!
5,7,2,NIBBLER,"Being brains, they feel compelled to know everything. And soon they will."
5,7,2,FRY,I'm as mad as I've ever been.
5,7,2,KEN,"Once their task is complete, they will ensure no new information arises in the only way possible: by destroying the universe."
5,7,2,FRY,Now it's personal.
5,7,2,FIONA,"Your mission is to infiltrate the Infosphere and plant this quantum-interphase bomb, blasting them into an alternate universe, from which there is no return."
5,7,2,NIBBLER,Then outrun the blast on this Scooty-Puff Jr.
5,7,2,FRY,
5,7,2,FRY,Aah! Brains!
5,7,2,KEN [ON SCREEN],"Fear not Mighty One, your missing brainwave makes you invisible to them. So long as you avoid intense thinking."
5,7,2,FRY,"Sorry, what? I wasn't paying attention."
5,7,2,KEN [ON SCREEN],That is most wise.
5,7,2,FRY,Who?
5,7,3,KEN [ON SCREEN],In a few seconds the brains will finish scanning the last bits of information in the universe.
5,7,3,KEN [ON SCREEN],"Now the Infosphere will open it's protective crust so as to scan itself, completing it's thousand year task."
5,7,3,FIONA [ON SCREEN],This is your one chance to enter the sphere! Scoot! Scoot now!
5,7,4,FRY,I'm at the input console. I'm a little nervous and I've got brain in my buttcrack.
5,7,4,NIBBLER [ON SCREEN],Roger.
5,7,4,KEN [ON SCREEN],"Once you press the detonator, you will have 60 seconds for an exciting escape."
5,7,4,FRY,"Hey wait, this brain knows everything about everything right?"
5,7,4,KEN [ON SCREEN],It will soon. That's why you're supposed to be setting off a bomb.
5,7,4,FRY,"Yeah yeah, but I can't pass up a chance to learn the answers to the greatest questions of all time. Is it true that post-it stamp glue is made up of -"
5,7,4,INFOSPHERE BRAIN,Correct. Toad mucus.
5,7,4,KEN [ON SCREEN],There's no time for this. Activate the bomb.
5,7,4,FRY,Wait wait wait. What really killed the dinosaurs?
5,7,4,INFOSPHERE BRAIN,Me!
5,7,4,COMPUTER VOICE,Unauthorised Data Access.
5,7,4,FRY,Uh oh.
5,7,4,GIANT BRAIN,Detecting trace amounts of mental activity. Possibly a dead weasel or a cartoon viewer.
5,7,4,FRY,Eww gross. Cut it out!
5,7,4,BRAIN #1,Odd. He is immune to our sionic attack.
5,7,4,BRAIN #2,Impossible. We're an ambitious young squad with everything to prove.
5,7,4,GIANT BRAIN,"It appears we are in the presence of the fabled one. But without his Scooty-Puff Jr, he cannot escape. Huh?"
5,7,4,BRAIN #2,A quantum-interphase bomb? Are you insane in the membrane?
5,7,4,FRY,You got it poindexter!
5,7,4,BRAIN #1,"Oh, not good!"
5,7,4,COMPUTER VOICE,Detonation in T-60 Earth seconds.
5,7,4,BRAIN #3,You fool. You'll be transported to the other universe with us. Trapped there for all eternity.
5,7,4,BRAIN #1,"And we'll form a tightly-knit clique, that you won't be part of!"
5,7,4,FRY,Well at least I did one important thing with my life. Leading good to victory over evil!
5,7,4,KEN [ON SCREEN],Exactly!
5,7,4,GIANT BRAIN,The Nibblonians? Good? During your last moments in this universe perhaps you should query our database concerning the night of December 31st 1999.
5,7,4,FRY,The day I got frozen? What about it?
5,7,4,NIBBLER [ON SCREEN],"No! Don't ask about that! It, it would be uh...boring!"
5,7,4,FRY,Eh forget it then.
5,7,4,GIANT BRAIN,Query!
5,7,4,FRY,
5,7,4,INFOSPHERE BRAIN,Clarification request. Are you the Philip J. Fry from Earth or the Philip J. Fry from Hovering Squidworld 97A?
5,7,4,GIANT BRAIN,Earth you fat idiot! Hurry up!
5,7,4,FRY [ON SCREEN],Hello? Pizza delivery for uh...I. C. Wiener? Aw crud!
5,7,4,FRY,"Eurgh! I can't believe how fat I look! Aw, Nibbler's there. Wait! What?!"
5,7,4,FRY [ON SCREEN],What the?
5,7,4,FRY,
5,7,4,COMPUTER VOICE,Detonation in T-15 seconds.
5,7,4,FRY,You little runts froze me! You took away my life!
5,7,4,NIBBLER [ON SCREEN],We can explain!
5,7,4,FRY,No you can't. Shut your adorable trap!
5,7,4,NIBBLER [ON SCREEN],We had no choice. You were the only one who could help us. What is one life weighed against the entire universe?
5,7,4,FRY (CRYING),But it was my life.
5,7,4,COMPUTER VOICE,"Detonation in 2, 1. Will the owner of a white Pontiac Firebird...oh nevermind. Zero!"
5,7,6,GIANT BRAIN,"Well, here we are. Trapped for eternity."
5,7,6,BRAIN #2,We could sing American Pie.
5,7,6,FRY,Go ahead. I deserve it. I wish those stupid racoons had never brought me to the future.
5,7,6,INFOSPHERE BRAIN,I have shocking data relevant to this conversation.
5,7,6,GIANT BRAIN,"We don't care you dope! We're in another universe, you're not in charge anymore."
5,7,6,INFOSPHERE BRAIN,It is possible for the Philip Fry to resume his life on December 31st 1999.
5,7,6,FRY,Really? I can go back in time?
5,7,6,INFOSPHERE BRAIN,"There is a nexus point between universes, at the space-time you entered the cryogenic tube. You and only you can return there."
5,7,6,GIANT BRAIN,Interesting. You could stop the Nibblonian from pushing you into the cryogenic tube.
5,7,6,FRY,That is interesting. Why?
5,7,6,GIANT BRAIN,It would be as if you never came to the future. You will have your life back and we will suceed in our plan to understand and destroy the universe.
5,7,6,FRY,Everybody wins!
5,7,6,BRAIN #2,The human will be returned to the past!
5,7,6,NARRATOR,Meanwhile...
5,7,6,LEELA,I love rocket skating! But the wait is always so long. Fry once stood in line for six hours just to get me a ticket.
5,7,6,CHAZ,Six hours? Pfft. Sounds like a real nobody! But now it's time for somebody and some chick he's with to go skating.
5,7,7,LEELA,You reserved the whole rink?
5,7,7,CHAZ,"Yup. Buzzed ahead, let 'em know who's aide was coming by. The mayor's, that's who's."
5,7,7,LEELA,Oh Chaz!
5,7,7,SALLY,Mr Vogel. I thought we was going skating.
5,7,7,VOGEL,No. We're not important enough. Everybody just hold hands until the bus driver gets back from his haircut.
5,7,7,LEELA,"Aww, let's let those kids skate with us."
5,7,7,CHAZ,What? Seriously? I'm trying to impress you with my cloud here.!
5,7,7,LEELA,"I know, and it's working. But think how much skating would mean to those kids."
5,7,7,ORPHAN,We came here instead of eating today.
5,7,7,LEELA,This may be their only chance to skate in their whole lives. Who are we to say they can't?
5,7,7,CHAZ,"The mayor's aide, and his badge! Beat it kids! Come back when you got connections."
5,7,7,VOGEL,Alright kids. Back to the Orphanarium. You can slide around the gym in your socks.
5,7,7,SALLY,What socks?
5,7,7,CHAZ,So am I gonna get lucky tonight or what?
5,7,7,FRY,I hope your calculations are correct.
5,7,7,GIANT BRAIN,Our calculations are always correct. For we are gigantic brains.
5,7,7,BRAIN #2,Initiate space-time transfer.
5,7,7,NIBBLER,I hereby place and order for one cheese pizza.
5,7,7,PANUCCI [ON PHONE],"One pie, nothing good on it. Name?"
5,7,7,NIBBLER,I-period C-period Wiener.
5,7,7,PANUCCI [ON PHONE],"Uh, talk a little louder. It's sounds like you got some kind of tiny head on you or something."
5,7,7,PAST FRY,"Hellooo? Pizza delivery for uh, Icy Wiener? Wiener? Aw crud."
5,7,7,FUTURE FRY,Gotcha!
5,7,7,NIBBLER,I don't understand.
5,7,7,FUTURE FRY,Yes you do! You came back in time to knock me into that freezer. Now I came back in time to stop you.
5,7,7,NIBBLER,I did not come back in time. My people lack that ability.
5,7,7,FUTURE FRY,"But, I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop."
5,7,7,NIBBLER,Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. You will meet me when I'm a thousand years older.
5,7,7,FUTURE FRY,Not if you don't freeze me.
5,7,7,NIBBLER,"Please. Our saviours foresee that in a thousand years, at one moment, the fate of the universe will depend on you. Since you will not live that long I must freeze you now."
5,7,7,FUTURE FRY,"Well, why couldn't you just ask me?"
5,7,7,NIBBLER,We were afraid you would refuse.
5,7,7,FUTURE FRY,"Of course not, I love the future."
5,7,7,NIBBLER (CHOKING),Then why are you choking me right now?
5,7,7,FUTURE FRY,Because I don't like being used.
5,7,7,NIBBLER,Well now it's your choice. Is there nothing in the future worth saving?
5,7,7,FUTURE FRY,Leela. But she doesn't think much of me.
5,7,7,NIBBLER,"Ah, she must be the other."
5,7,7,FUTURE FRY,Wha?
5,7,7,NIBBLER,You must not give up on her. I am stationed on a distant world known as Vergon 6. But if you return to the future I will transfer to Earth to give you what help I can.
5,7,7,FUTURE FRY,You really think I would have had a chance with Leela?
5,7,7,NIBBLER,You must choose. The present or the future? To save yourself? Or to save Leela?
5,7,7,FUTURE FRY,Yes! Here I come future! Oh no! Wait! I'm gonna get trapped in the Infosphere again! Just remember that Scooty-Puff Jr sucks...
5,7,7,NIBBLER,In a thousand years I'll get right on it.
5,7,7,NARRATOR,"And so, a thousand years later Fry once again infiltrated the Infosphere and set off his amazing bomb. Only this time..."
5,7,7,NIBBLER,Thank you for saving the universe Fry. Here.
5,7,7,FRY,"Whoa, thanks! If you ever need a saviour again, just ask."
5,7,7,NIBBLER,Oh we will. We will.
5,7,7,FRY,"Man, I can't wait to tell everyone what happened."
5,7,7,NIBBLER,Uh yes. Incidentally I need to remain undercover so I'm blanking your memory.
5,7,7,FRY,Huh. Did everything just taste purple for a second? Oh well. Let's go home you dumb poop machine.
5,7,7,LEELA,"Bender, would you do the honours?"
5,7,7,BENDER,With gusto.
5,7,7,FRY,Hey Leela. I guess I got this for you.
5,7,7,LEELA,Oh. Thank you. You know what Fry. I don't care if you're not the most important person in the universe. It really makes me happy to see you right now.
5,7,7,FRY,Then I am the most important person in the universe.
5,7,7,FRY (OVER CREDITS),Yes!
