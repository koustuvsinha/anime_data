5,8,0,"""THE STING""","By Patric M. Verrone Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
5,8,0,BENDER,"A hush comes over the crowd. The only sound is Bender calling everyone else a jerk and he swings! And he slices it into the water, oh man!"
5,8,0,FARNSWORTH,Bad news everyone. You're not good enough to go on your next mission.
5,8,0,FRY,Hooray!
5,8,0,BENDER,Not good enough!
5,8,0,LEELA,Why? Says who?
5,8,0,FARNSWORTH,Because. And says me. It's an extremely dangerous mission that killed my last crew. And you're not nearly as good as them.
5,8,0,FRY,Woohoo!
5,8,0,BENDER,We live to suck another day!
5,8,0,LEELA,We're just as good as any of those crews you sent to their deaths. What's the mission?
5,8,0,FARNSWORTH,Collecting honey. Ordinary honey.
5,8,0,LEELA,That doesn't sound so dangerous.
5,8,0,FARNSWORTH,This is no ordinary honey. It's produced by vicious space bees. A single sting of their hideous neuro-toxin can cause instant death!
5,8,0,HERMES,"And that's if you're not allergic! You don't wanna know what happens then, oh no no, God no!"
5,8,0,FARNSWORTH,Your insides will boil out of your eye sockets like a science fair volcano!
5,8,0,HERMES,I didn't want to know1
5,8,0,FARNSWORTH,These bees are larger than most Buicks and twice as ugly!
5,8,0,FRY,Larger than an American sedan? How big is the honey comb?
5,8,0,HERMES,Honey comb's big. Yeah yeah yeah.
5,8,0,BENDER,It's not small?
5,8,0,HERMES,No no no.
5,8,0,LEELA,It'll take more than deadly deadly bees to keep us from doing our job. Come on boys!
5,8,0,FRY,But Leela we're no good!
5,8,0,LEELA,"Listen, I'm scared too. But I'm more scared of disappointing myself."
5,8,0,FRY,I'm not scared of that at all!
5,8,0,LEELA,Now bees communicate by dancing.
5,8,0,FRY,"Like my parents. Oh wait, that was hitting!"
5,8,0,LEELA,So this language cartridge will let you distract them.
5,8,0,BENDER,Ah good! I always have thoughts and feelings that can only be expressed through dance! You stink! Bender's great! Deal with it!
5,8,0,LEELA,Bender quick! Waggle something!
5,8,0,BENDER (IN BEE),Hello fellow bees. How's the abdomen? Swollen with nectar I trust?
5,8,0,BEE (IN BEE),Duh!
5,8,0,FRY,Leela let's turn back. There's absolutely no shame in wussing out.
5,8,0,LEELA,"Relax, everything'll be fine!"
5,8,0,FRY,Oh my God! The old Planet Express ship!
5,8,0,LEELA,There's the black box!
5,8,0,MAN [ON TAPE],"Captain, the bees have us surrounded! Oh the Professor was right, we're not as good as his old crew!"
5,8,0,CAPTAIN [ON TAPE],Well I aim to prove him wrong! It'll take more than a few deadly deadly bees to - Oh Lord!
5,8,0,LEELA,"Uh, couldn't make that out. Too much static!"
5,8,0,BENDER,Ew!
5,8,0,LEELA,We found it! The honey comb hideout!
5,8,0,FRY,Hey what's this goop?
5,8,0,LEELA,Royal jelly. They feed it to the queen.
5,8,0,FRY,Bees make honey and jelly? Huh. How come nothing humans make taste good? Help! I can't swim in jelly as far as I know!
5,8,0,LEELA,Look! It's a baby queen! Aww she's so cute! You adorable wittle itty bitty fuzzy wuzzy -
5,8,0,FRY,Leela! Stop bonding and lets go! I got jelly in my underpants!
5,8,0,LEELA,I'm taking this bee with us. With queen we can build a hive and make more honey ourselves. Let me just pack her a lunch and we'll go.
5,8,0,BENDER (IN BEE),Pick up the pace lady! I'm sick of shaking my booty for these fat jerks! I didn't mean you're all fat. Just fatso there.
5,8,0,BEES (IN BEE),He insulted our fat queen!
5,8,0,QUEEN (IN BEE),"You try keeping your figure after 10,000 kids!"
5,8,0,LEELA,This is where we distinguish ourselves from the last crew. Activate emergency high speed self contained escape pack crisis response unit! Quick!
5,8,0,,[She flies off with a jet pack. Fry turns his on but he is wearing it the wrong way and flies off upside down. The bees chase him and Leela. Fry hits the sides of the honey comb on the way through the tunnels and Bender hangs onto the queen's sting screaming. Leela dodges a bee and it hits the comb and explodes.
5,8,1,LEELA,Good luck Bender!
5,8,4,BENDER,I'm back baby!
5,8,5,FRY,We made it! We're alive!
5,8,5,LEELA,Burn on that old crew! The only things they did better than us were suck and die!
5,8,5,FRY,Leela we got lucky this time but you should be more careful. I don't want anything to happen to you.
5,8,5,LEELA,"Thanks, but I can look out for myself. Frankly I can smell danger a mile away."
5,8,5,FRY,Look out! You want her you'll have to go through me.
5,8,5,LEELA,You call that a wound? That's a boo boo top! But thanks for trying to save me Fry! Fry? He's...he's dead.
5,8,5,BENDER (CRYING),Who will make Bender waffles just the way he likes them now?
5,8,5,LEELA (CRYING),It was all my fault! He died because of me!
5,8,5,FARNSWORTH,No no no no no no no. I'm lying to make her feel better.
5,8,5,LABARBARA,"Husband, can't you go anywhere without lighting something up?"
5,8,5,HERMES,It's an old Jamaican accounting tradition. We burn his timecard. That way his zombie doesn't come back looking for his final paycheque.
5,8,5,AMY,He looks so natural. It's funny to think he's clammed full of sawdust and preservatives.
5,8,5,ZOIDBERG,I only wish I could have removed the stinger.
5,8,5,PRIEST,"I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him."
5,8,5,HERMES,Soothe us with sweet lies.
5,8,5,PRIEST,It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only 15 seconds. Yet the pain was so intense that it felt to him like 15 years. And it goes without saying that it caused him to empty his bowels. We now commend Fry's body to the ages.
5,8,5,AMY,He's walking on sunshine now.
5,8,5,FARNSWORTH,This makes me the oldest member of my family.
5,8,5,AMAZONIAN,Him do good snu-snu.
5,8,5,BENDER,"All those times I said ""Kill all humans"" I'd always whisper ""except one."" And Fry was that one. And I never told him so."
5,8,5,TERRY (DRAMATICALLY),Farewell from the world of tomorrow!
5,8,5,LEELA (CRYING),They say a spoonful of space honey helps ease the pain. It's good. I feel funny. Haha funny!
5,8,5,FRY,Leela?
5,8,5,LEELA,Fry? I thought you were dead.
5,8,5,FRY,"Nope, I'm better than ever. Before the accident I couldn't do this!"
5,8,5,LEELA,Impressive! But it does sorta support my You-Are-Dead theory.
5,8,5,FRY,Then I'll prove I'm alive! By telling you something only I could know. There's a surprise for you in my locker. I got it at a Swedish novelty shop before we left.
5,8,5,LEELA,It's too beautiful to open! Can I open it?
5,8,5,FRY,Sure. There's just one thing I want you to.
5,8,5,LEELA,What?
5,8,5,FRY,I want you to wake up.
5,8,5,LEELA,Wake up? But I'm not -
5,8,6,LEELA,In my dream Fry said he hid a gift for me in my locker. If it's true then he must still exist in some form.
5,8,6,FARNSWORTH,"Oh course he still exists. As a frozen corpse in outer space! Oh, I made myself sad."
5,8,6,LEELA,"Well, here goes."
5,8,6,ZOIDBERG,Bupkiss!
5,8,6,BENDER,"Well, I feel better now. Pawning all the stuff in Fry's locker helped give me closure."
5,8,6,LEELA,Was there anything in there that might have been a gift for me?
5,8,6,BENDER,No. Nothing. Not at all. No way Jos√©! Here it is.
5,8,6,LEELA,You took this from Fry's locker?
5,8,6,BENDER,Hey the guy's dead! There's no law against grave robbing!
5,8,6,LEELA,That proves it. Fry is alive somewhere and he's reaching me in my dreams.
5,8,6,FARNSWORTH,Bullpies!
5,8,6,FARNSWORTH,Lay down here and we'll do some tests. If Fry is out there then Leela's brain could be acting as a five pound ouija board.
5,8,6,LEELA,Is this some sort of brain scanner?
5,8,6,FARNSWORTH,"Some sort yes. In France it's called a ""guillotine."""
5,8,6,LEELA,Professor! Can't you examine my brain without removing it?
5,8,6,FARNSWORTH,Yes. Easily.
5,8,6,BENDER,"Hey, what if Fry wasn't actually dead when we buried him? Y'know like Julia Roberts?"
5,8,6,FARNSWORTH,Well I suppose there's a slim - I don't believe it!
5,8,6,LEELA,What is it? Is Fry alive in some other dimension or something?
5,8,6,FARNSWORTH,"No. According to this gizmometer, Fry is dead and nothing can bring him back! Remarkable."
5,8,6,LEELA,"But, my dream. Your science can't unprove that! How could I have know the gift was in Fry's locker?"
5,8,6,HERMES,Easy! He told you about it before he died! And your grief roasted mind blocked it out.
5,8,6,LEELA,Are you saying I'm going crazy?
5,8,6,FARNSWORTH,"No no, no one's saying that! But I'm certainly thinking it loudly."
5,8,7,FRY,"Hi Leela! I'm just gonna keep talking, even if you can't hear me. Blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah."
5,8,7,LEELA,"Shut up, I can hear you. The Professor says you're just a dream."
5,8,7,FRY,Oh yeah? Could a dream take you dancing in an illusion garden?
5,8,7,LEELA,"Well yes, technically. It's still very sweet of you."
5,8,7,FRY,Then what if we shared a sleigh ride across the ice fields of Hiperia?
5,8,7,LEELA,Oh Fry you must be alive! I've never been treated so romantically by my own imagination before!
5,8,7,FRY,"Here, take my jacket. You look a little cold."
5,8,7,LEELA,Thank you. It's all so beautiful I forgot how many hundreds of degrees zero it must be. I just wish I could convince the others you're alive.
5,8,7,FRY,You can. All you have to do is wake up.
5,8,7,LEELA,No no! Don't say that! This is real!
5,8,8,LEELA,Not another dream! Fry's jacket! The one he was buried in! My dream was real! He's alive!
5,8,8,BENDER,That's better!
5,8,8,LEELA,Fry's alive! I have proof!
5,8,8,BENDER,You do not!
5,8,8,HERMES,"I'm from Jamaica, the show-me island. So show me you're blowing it out your fanny."
5,8,8,LEELA,But he gave me his jacket. Look.
5,8,8,FARNSWORTH,That's not Fry's jacket. Fry's jacket is red! That's your jacket. An off the rack lime green affair.
5,8,8,LEELA,But Fry...his jacket...and when I woke up it was on me.
5,8,8,HERMES,"You're under a lot of guilt stress Leela. Here, work it off."
5,8,8,LEELA [SQUEEZING],I am not under stress dammit!
5,8,8,LEELA,What?
5,8,8,AMY,I said everything's going to be alright.
5,8,8,LEELA,Oh. Maybe I am freaking out a little.
5,8,8,BENDER,A little? You're screwier than my Aunt Rita! And she's a screw!
5,8,8,LEELA,I need to calm down. I'd better take some more of that space honey.
5,8,8,FARNSWORTH,You've been taking space honey? Be careful you purple haired imbecile!
5,8,8,ZOIDBERG,"One spoonful calms you down, two spoonfuls help you sleep, but three spoonfuls, you'll go into a sleep and never wake up! Never!"
5,8,8,BENDER (AMY'S VOICE),Never!
5,8,8,LEELA,"One spoonful to calm me down. OK, I've got a pretty good calm going! Two spoonfuls to help me sleep. Uh oh, still awake. I guess one more spoonful couldn't hurt. Oh my gosh! I'd better get a sponge! Fry? Is that you? I don't need a sponge!"
5,8,8,FRY,Why and I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?
5,8,8,FARNSWORTH,"Incredible! According to the gizmometer, Fry touched the royal jelly in the space hive, leaving an imprint of his DNA and brainwaves. Then, when it spilled on the couch, it recombined with trace amounts of Fry's hair and skin -"
5,8,8,BENDER,And blood! Don't forget about Fry's blood!
5,8,8,FARNSWORTH,"Yes Bender, thank you. In short, the various fluids Fry left in the couch caused the royal jelly to regenerate his entire being!"
5,8,8,FRY,Neat!
5,8,8,BENDER,This is great! My buddy's alive and his credit cards are valid again! Lets go get hammered!
5,8,8,ZOIDBERG,I should warn you: I'm a mean drunk.
5,8,8,LEELA,"Fry, I'm so glad I didn't kill you."
5,8,8,FRY,Me too.
5,8,8,LEELA,Feeling responsible for your death was driving me mad. But now everything is alright.
5,8,8,FRY,"Uh, not everything."
5,8,8,LEELA,What? What do you mean?
5,8,8,FRY,You have to wake up.
5,8,8,LEELA,Wake up? Oh no! No! It can't be!
5,8,9,LEELA,Poo.
5,8,9,LEELA,"I'm cracking up. In my dreams I'm happy because Fry is alive, but when I'm awake my mind plays tricks on me."
5,8,9,HERMES,Oh take it easy Leela.
5,8,9,AMY,In every life we have some trouble.
5,8,9,BENDER,But when you worry you make it double.
5,8,9,FARNSWORTH (SINGING),The landlord says your rent is late...
5,8,9,HERMES (SINGING),He might have to litigate.
5,8,9,BENDER (SINGING),But don't worry!
5,8,9,BEE (SINGING),Bee...
5,8,9,FARNSWORTH (SINGING),...happy!
5,8,9,ZOIDBERG (SINGING),"Ain't got no cash, Ain't got no style, Ladies vomit when I smile, But does Zoidberg worry?"
5,8,9,BEE (SINGING),Bee...
5,8,9,ZOIDBERG (SINGING),...happy!
5,8,9,HERMES (SINGING),Don't worry now Amy!
5,8,9,AMY (SINGING),
5,8,9,BENDER (SINGING),Take us home Bender! Don't worry!
5,8,9,BEE (SINGING),Bee...
5,8,9,BENDER (SINGING),...happy!
5,8,9,LEELA,"Uh, were you just singing?"
5,8,9,BENDER,No I was telling you not to worry. I'm not allowed to sing - court order.
5,8,9,LEELA,"I'll find Fry's coffin, take his corpse and keep it under my mattress to remind me he's really dead. That'll prove I'm not insane."
5,8,9,LEELA,
5,8,10,LEELA,What happened? Why am I in my apartment?
5,8,10,LEELA,Stop it! Stop it!
5,8,10,BENDER,You killed Fry!
5,8,10,LEELA,
5,8,10,FRY'S PHOTO,"Leela! No! Listen to me, you don't want to lie in bed like a vegetable and do nothing the rest of your life. I've tried it. Bedsores hurt!"
5,8,10,LEELA (CRYING),Then what am I s'posed to do?
5,8,10,FRY'S PHOTO,Fight it!
5,8,10,LEELA (CRYING),I can't!
5,8,10,FRY'S PHOTO,You can! The Leela I know doesn't give up this easily.
5,8,10,LEELA,
5,8,10,FRY'S PHOTO,I don't know if you can hear me Leela but there's something I wanna tell you. I love you.
5,8,10,LEELA (CRYING),I'm so scared Fry I don't know what to do.
5,8,10,FRY'S PHOTO,Just wake up Leela. Please. Just wake up.
5,8,10,LEELA (CRYING),I don't understand what you mean!
5,8,11,FRY (CRYING),Just wake up. Please. Just wake up Leela.
5,8,11,LEELA,Fry. You're alive!
5,8,11,FRY,Leela! You're awake!
5,8,11,LEELA,Of course I'm awake. You wouldn't stop waking me. Where am I?
5,8,11,FRY,In the hospital. The ambulance brought you here right after the bee stung you.
5,8,11,LEELA,But the bee stung you. It barely touched me.
5,8,11,FRY,Stinger went right through me and you got all the poison. My new spleen came from a guy who liked to motorcycle.
5,8,11,HERMES,Sweet three toed sloth of ice planet Hoth! She's awake!
5,8,11,BENDER,You were in the best coma I've ever seen!
5,8,11,AMY,The doctor said you'd never wake up.
5,8,11,LEELA,Really? How long was I out?
5,8,11,AMY,Two weeks. Fry never left your side for a minute.
5,8,11,ZOIDBERG,"And he talked non-stop, like a parrot of the sea he was."
5,8,11,FRY,"I though that if you heard a familiar voice, it might help keep your mind together. But, who knows if it really got through."
5,8,11,LEELA,It got through Fry. It got through.
