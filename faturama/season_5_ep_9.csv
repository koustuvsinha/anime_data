5,9,0,"""THE FARNSWORTH PARABOX""","By Bill Odenkirk Transcribed by Dave, The Neutral Planet"
5,9,2,FRY (SHOUTING),"I know you've rejected me a lot before but frankly I wasn't sure we were right for each other either, but now I am! So how 'bout a date tonight?"
5,9,2,LEELA,": Sorry I think I, um, I think I left my toaster on."
5,9,2,FRY (SHOUTING),"C'mon Leela, what's the real reason you won't go out with me?"
5,9,2,LEELA (SHOUTING),"Look, I'm embarrassed to admit this but you forced me to. I can't go out tonight because ......I have sweaty boot rash!"
5,9,2,AMY,No spluh! Why do you think I'm sitting over here in the stink-free zone?
5,9,2,FRY,"So, will you go out with me?"
5,9,2,FARNSWORTH,"Good news everyone, I'm still technically alive! Yes! But I need to you to dispose of this crazy ass experiment that almost killed me. You'll have to throw it into the sun itself, for only the thermonuclear inferno of the sun has enough energy to ensure its total destruction!"
5,9,2,BENDER,I can hit it with a shovel!
5,9,2,FARNSWORTH,That's not good enough.
5,9,2,BENDER,This one time I pounded a guy into the ground like a stake with a shovel!
5,9,2,FARNSWORTH,Yes yes!
5,9,2,ZOIDBERG,So what's in the box already?
5,9,2,FARNSWORTH,No peeking! I don't know what's in there but I'm sure our minds would be unable to comprehend -
5,9,2,HERMES,Ow! You hurt my collater!
5,9,2,FARNSWORTH,"I don't care. Listen well: No matter what happens, no matter how great your curiosity, you are forbidden to look in this box. Forbidden! Pretty tantilising though!"
5,9,2,FRY,Whatever's in there it's the only thing I've ever wanted.
5,9,2,ZOIDBERG,In my experience boxes are usually empty. Or maybe with a little cheese stuck to the top. And one time pepperoni! What a day that was! Give me the box!
5,9,2,HERMES,"Scram you lousy green snakes! Here Leela, take this and use it to shoot those guys."
5,9,2,LEELA,Right! If they try to look in the box.
5,9,2,HERMES,Whatever.
5,9,2,FRY,Let's just forget about the box. The Professor said to stay away.
5,9,2,BENDER,"Fry, how can you be so naive? He was joking. Get it?"
5,9,2,FRY,No.
5,9,2,BENDER,That's what makes it so funny! OK he wasn't joking now shut up and follow me.
5,9,2,FRY [FROM VENT],Ow it's hot! The butter in my pocket is melting!
5,9,5,BENDER,We thank you Bender for the gift we are about to receive!
5,9,5,FRY,Tangled up Christmas lights! We can take shifts untangling them!
5,9,5,BENDER,Unlabled booze! Widemouth too!
5,9,6,LEELA,That oughta keep those dopes occupied. I can guard the real box in peace now that no one's curious about it.
5,9,6,LEELA,"Well, I got through the night and no one looked in the box. Not even me. The person who gave up her whole evening to watch it. A whole evening of TV gone. What a mockery of justice it is that I can't take even a little tiny peek! I need coffee. OK. Heads I look, tails I don't. Oh yeah! Heads! I mean - alright then! No. I have a duty not to look. But then again, I promised the coin I would. Oh it's deep. Deeper than a small box should be."
5,9,7,LEELA,Ouch! My lawyer will hear about this!
5,9,7,FRY 1,"Leela, what have you done?"
5,9,7,LEELA,"Nothing. What do you mean ""why was I looking in the box?"""
5,9,7,FRY 1,I mean your hair. It's all different-y.
5,9,7,LEELA,Bender? Is that you?
5,9,7,BENDER 1,You know it! Large and in charge!
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH 1,"Leela? Oh, there's a woman for you! Always dying her hair instead of not looking in a box."
5,9,7,LEELA,I didn't dye my hair. This is how I always look.
5,9,7,BENDER 1,"No, that's how you always look. This throws my entire perception of reality into question. Clone? Robot? Or long lost twin? Taking all bets! I also offer video poker!"
5,9,7,FRY 1,It's some guy wearing a Leela costume! Get him!
5,9,7,LEELA,Hold it! You have this all wrong. I just fell into the box and then I fell out somehow.
5,9,7,FRY 1,You shut up sir.
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH 1,"No wait, I've got it! I know what's in the box. Oh I've been as dumb as Fry!"
5,9,7,FRY 1,Am not!
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH 1,It contains a parallel universe! And when you create a parallel universe it's almost always populated by evil twins!
5,9,7,LEELA,"No look, I am not evil. My loan officer said so."
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH 1,Oh you'd like us to believe that wouldn't you Leela? Or should I say Eveela?
5,9,7,BENDER 1,Oh this is awful. Somewhere there's a Bender more evil than me. I do my best dammit!
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH 1,Leela? The good Leela. I want you to snoop around the other universe and find out how evil they are. Here.
5,9,7,LEELA,I tell you they're not evil. But don't be confused. They are jerks.
5,9,7,LEELA 1,Come out of your universe with your hands up!
5,9,7,FRY,Oh wow. It's like that drug trip I saw in that movie when I was on that drug trip.
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH,Astonishing. I must have created a parallel universe!
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH 1,Baldercrap! I created your universe! All you created was my fist parallel to your face!
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH,Ow.
5,9,7,LEELA,Look. It doesn't matter who created what. The important thing is - yah!
5,9,7,LEELA 1 (WHISPERING),"We're exactly the same. I know all her moves. Therefore, I've got the upper hand."
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH 1,"Now now, perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything."
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH,Let's recap what's happened so far. As you can see I accidentally created a box containing your universe.
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH 1,"While I, in a simultaineous blunder created a box containing your universe."
5,9,7,LEELA,"This is getting confusing. Why don't we call our universe ""Universe A"" and this universe ""Universe B""?"
5,9,7,BENDER 1,"Hey, why can't we be universe A?"
5,9,7,FRY 1,Yeah!
5,9,7,AMY 1,Yeah!
5,9,7,ZOIDBERG 1,We want the best letter!
5,9,7,FRY,"We called it first. Besides, this place kinda feels like a ""B"" y'know?"
5,9,7,LEELA 1,"Alright, you can be crummy universe A. And we'll be universe 1!"
5,9,7,FRY 1,"Or ""The Mongooses,"" that's a cool team name. The Fighting Mongooses!"
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH,Wait a minute. If our universes are identical then why did our Leela look into the box and your Leela didn't?
5,9,7,LEELA 1,Well to be honest I tossed a coin. It came up tails so I didn't look.
5,9,7,LEELA,That's weird. Mine came up heads so I did.
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH,Interesting. Apparently the key difference between our universes is that coin flips have opposite outcomes.
5,9,7,BENDER,That explains fruity here! I tossed a coin to pick my finish. Foghat grey!
5,9,7,BENDER 1,Hey! Bite my glorious golden ass!
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH,Your people and your slight differences disgust me. I'm going home. Where's that blue box with our universe in it?
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH 1,Oh you'd like to get back to your evil universe wouldn't you? And destroy your box with our universe inside it.
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH,Nonsense! I would never do such a thing unless you would already have been going to do that!
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH 1,Wha?
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH,You heard me!
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH 1,"In any case, I've hidden the box and it will remain hidden unitil I'm convinced you're not evil! Everyone, keep an eye on your evil counterpart."
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH,And you all do the same!
5,9,7,LEELA 1,"Um, can Fry and I watch our parallel selves together? We have plans tonight."
5,9,7,LEELA,You guys are dating?
5,9,7,FRY 1,Oh no no no. We're married.
5,9,7,BENDER,I've got my eye on you boy!
5,9,7,BENDER 1,Don't even think about it lunch-pail! You'd be dead before you hit the ground!
5,9,7,BENDER,Good point. Whatyya say we just hit a strip joint?
5,9,7,BENDER 1,"I was waitin' for one of us to say that! Bender A, you're a prince among robots! Can you forgive me for distrusting you?"
5,9,7,BENDER,"Aw, I can't stay mad at what is essentially me. I love me!"
5,9,7,AMY 1,This is so great! I always wanted an imaginary friend!
5,9,7,AMY,"I'm not imaginary, I'm parallel! We're exactly the same, right down to the - Splech! Is that pink nail polish?"
5,9,7,AMY 1,"Is that not pink nail polish? The Professor's right, you are evil! And shallow!"
5,9,7,AMY,I am not evil!
5,9,7,LEELA,"So Fry, Leela, how'd you two get together?"
5,9,7,FRY 1,Funny story. I asked Leela out a million times and she just kept rejecting me.
5,9,7,LEELA 1,"I'd make up things like ""I have sweaty boot-rash"" or ""I have to meet the President""!"
5,9,7,FRY 1,"Oh man, you never heard such excuses! But, like a dope, I believed her. Looking back on it now it's kinda funny!"
5,9,7,FRY (SARCASTIC),"It sure is, right Leela? Funny. Ha ha ha ha!"
5,9,7,LEELA 1,Then one night when Fry asked me out the only excuse I could think of involved ghosts. I knew he wouldn't buy it so I did what I always do in those situations.
5,9,7,LEELA,Oh Lord!
5,9,7,LEELA 1,I flipped a coin. It came up heads and we went out.
5,9,7,FRY,You mean you flipped the coin too? And it was tails? So that's why you said you had to meet that ghost.
5,9,7,LEELA 1,You really missed out on something Leela. That date was magical.
5,9,7,FRY 1,"One year later I gave Leela a diamond scrunchy, and we were married."
5,9,7,LEELA,Woo!
5,9,7,FRY,One year later I got beat up at a Neil Diamond concert by a guy named Scrunchy!
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH 1,Well that was pointless.
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH,"Say, I hope you won't think it ""evil"" of me to ask how you got that stylish head wound!"
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH 1,Oh this old thing? I was experimenting to see if I could remove my own brain!
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH,Of course! I had the same idea! I flipped a coin to decide if I should proceed but it came up tails - so I didn't. How'd it go?
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH 1,Well getting the brain out was the easy part. The hard part was getting the brain out!
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH,Oh you!
5,9,7,ZOIDBERG 1,"So, tell me about yourself!"
5,9,7,ZOIDBERG,Well don't look into it but I'm a respected internal medicine doctor! Ooo a can!
5,9,7,ZOIDBERG 1,"As for me I design mansions, then live in them. I'm lying! I'm an appalling failure!"
5,9,7,ZOIDBERG (CRYING),Me too! A big fat one.
5,9,7,ZOIDBERG 1,And those co-workers. Always looking down on us Zoidbergs. What are they? From Nob Hill?
5,9,7,ZOIDBERG,"They're all like ""Stop spraying me with ink Zoidberg!"" ""Put on pants Zoidberg!"" ""Don't touch our fancy box Zoidberg!"""
5,9,7,ZOIDBERG 1,Oh that box! Too good for us is it?
5,9,7,ZOIDBERG,"Bah! Someday they'll watch! From down in the gutter they will, as King Zoidberg caresses their fancy box."
5,9,7,ZOIDBERG 1,"You know, maybe a certain blue lobster saw where Professor hid the box!"
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH 1,Good news everyones!
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH,"After carefully reading the scriptures, we've concluded that none of us are evil!"
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH 1,"Yes, the Bible is the real good news! Anyhow, you're all free to go back to your own universe."
5,9,7,HERMES 1,What's goin' on here? Why aren't you all out destroying the Professor's box?
5,9,7,LEELA 1,"Hermes, aren't you confused about the fact thats there's two of everybody?"
5,9,7,HERMES 1,"No. Now like my granny used to say back in her tall paper shack on Montego Bay ""If you want a box hurled into the sun, you got to do it yourself!"""
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH 1,Your granny can go to hell! I've hidden the box so that no one can destroy the home universe of my handsome friend here!
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH,Oh go on! Wait a second. If your Hermes was about to destroy the box containing our universe...
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH 1,Then your Hermes...
5,9,7,FARNSWORTH,Oh my!
5,9,8,HERMES,"Like granny said ""If you want a box hurled into the sun, you got to do it yourself!"" God rest her zombie bones."
5,9,8,LEELA,So we go through the box and stop Hermes?
5,9,8,FARNSWORTH,Right. Good thing Professor B there hid it in the sealed clam tank. No one but a crazy lobster would look there!
5,9,8,FARNSWORTH 1,It's gone!
5,9,9,ZOIDBERG,All hail Zoidberg! The king with the box! Now it's my turn maybe?
5,9,9,ZOIDBERG 1,The box says no.
5,9,9,HERMES 1 (CRYING),"If I know parallel Hermes, he's at the sun by now."
5,9,9,BENDER 1,Our universe is doomed!
5,9,9,BENDER AND BENDER 1,Dooooomed!
5,9,9,FARNSWORTH 1,Now don't give up yet you cry babies. The box is gone but we still have one preposterously slim hope.
5,9,9,AMY,Is it a kind of hairspray?
5,9,9,FARNSWORTH,No. We must attempt to create another box containing our universe! Doy!
5,9,9,FRY 1,Well? Is that your universe in there?
5,9,9,FRY [FROM BOX],Nope. Too cold.
5,9,9,HERMES 1,"Oh man it's hopeless! We'll never find your universe in time! Plus, this box is stuck on my fat head."
5,9,9,FARNSWORTH 1,Yes it's the apocalypse alright. I always thought I'd have a hand in it!
5,9,9,BENDER 1,"I'm not sad. Because I finally found someone as great as me! It's like I always say: ""Make new friends and keep the old. One is silver..."""
5,9,9,BENDER,"""...and the other's gold!"""
5,9,9,ZOIDBERG 1,Why with the long faces?
5,9,9,LEELA 1,The idiots have the box!
5,9,9,ZOIDBERG,I think she means you.
5,9,9,FARNSWORTH 1,Grab them!
5,9,9,AMY,Splug! Which one did they go into?
5,9,9,FARNSWORTH 1,"We'll have to search a universe. Everyone, grab a length of wire first so you can find your way back."
5,9,9,AMY 1,Hello? Did you see two smelly lobsters?
5,9,9,HERMES 25,We didn't see anything.......ever!
5,9,9,FRY,"Yo, did two shellfish in scrubs go by?"
5,9,9,FRY 1729,Hell no.
5,9,9,LEELA 1729,Shut up!
5,9,9,BENDER 1729,Beat it jerk!
5,9,9,LEELA,"Uh, have you robot versions of yourselves seen any extra Zoidbergs around here?"
5,9,9,LEELA,"Uh, access denied."
5,9,9,BENDER 1,Hey man look what I snagged from the leprachaun universe!
5,9,9,BENDER,Yeah leprachaun universe is fine...if you haven't seen pirate universe!
5,9,9,BENDER 1,Faith and begota!
5,9,9,FARNSWORTH XVII,Quae?
5,9,9,ZOIDBERG,"Quick, into another box!"
5,9,9,ZOIDBERG 1,"There aren't any in this universe there aren't. Hey you, what with the no boxes?"
5,9,9,FARNSWORTH 420,"Baby they're somewhere, everything's like somewhere! Place is kinda au natural right now."
5,9,9,FARNSWORTH 1,There they are!
5,9,9,FARNSWORTH,Gotcha!
5,9,9,FARNSWORTH 420,Dig it! All of you living in this boxed is like seriously freaked up!
5,9,9,FARNSWORTH,"Nonsense, why there's a whole universe in there."
5,9,9,FARNSWORTH 420,"Dude, there's a universe in all of us."
5,9,9,AMY 420,Right on Professor Freaksworth!
5,9,9,FARNSWORTH,Get a job! We've got the box. Everyone pull your wires.
5,9,9,FARNSWORTH,Hurry! Back to Universe A!
5,9,9,FARNSWORTH,Hermes don't press that button!
5,9,9,OK.,
5,9,9,ZOIDBERG,So long your majesty!
5,9,9,FRY,"There but for the flip of a coin go we. So uh Leela, seeing how the universe wasn't destroyed, you wanna catch an ape fight? Y'know? Together?"
5,9,9,LEELA,"Well, I guess you deserve one more flip."
5,9,9,FRY,So? Heads or tails?
5,9,9,LEELA,"Y'know, lets just say it's heads."
5,9,9,FARNSWORTH,Ready?
5,9,9,FARNSWORTH,There. That space-time inversion has given us their box and vice-versa!
5,9,9,LEELA,So what you think you just explain to us is that -
5,9,9,FARNSWORTH,Correct! This box contains our own universe!
5,9,9,HERMES,Sweet honey bee of infinity!
5,9,9,LEELA,"Bender, quit destroying the universe!"
5,9,9,BENDER,But...aw!
5,9,9,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, all that is and ever shall be is in that box! And the box itself is probably worth something too. We must cherish it, as we cherish every moment of our lives."
