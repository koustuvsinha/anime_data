0,0,513,SAWYER,What?
0,0,513,SAYID,Sixteen years. Five months. And nine days. That's the count.
0,0,513,CHARLIE,The count? What -- ?
0,0,513,BOONE,"You wanna give us a minute here, man? 'Cause this is --"
0,0,513,SAYID,"The message. The iterations. It's a distress call. A mayday. A plea for help. And if the counter's right, it's been playing... over and over for sixteen years."
0,0,514,BOONE,Someone else was stranded here?
0,0,514,KATE,Maybe someone came for them...
0,0,514,SAWYER,"If someone came, why's it still playing?"
0,0,515,CHARLIE,Guys -- where are we?
0,0,22,KOREAN MAN,
0,0,26,CLAIRE,-- I'm having contractions--
0,0,27,JACK,-- that's not ideal... how many months pregnant are you--?
0,0,27,CLAIRE,-- almost eight months--
0,0,27,JACK CLAIRE,"-- how far apart are they--? -- I don't know, a few of 'em just happened--"

0,0,33,JACK (CONT'D),I'll be back soon.
0,0,33,CLAIRE,-- thank you--
0,0,34,HURLEY,"-- hey, what's your name?!"
0,0,35,JACK,Jack!

0,0,38,JACK BOONE,-- stop -- her head's not tilted far back enough -- -- are you sure? I'm a you're blowing air into her lifeguard! I'm licensed! stomach-- -- you seriously need to think about giving back that license --

0,0,41,BOONE JACK,"-- hey man, she's still not -- yeah, good idea -- you go Maybe we need to do one of get me a pen! those hole things -- where you stick a pen in her throat?"

0,0,50,JACK (CONT'D),-- you okay?
0,0,51,JACK (CONT'D),Stay with her.
0,0,51,HURLEY,"Dude, I'm not goin' anywhere."
0,0,57,BOONE,-- I didn't know which one would work best.
0,0,58,JACK,... they're all good. Thanks...
0,0,61,CHARLIE SAWYER,"-- you, uh... s'cuse me, ya -- you sure you want me to sure you should be smoking--? shove my foot up your ass?"
0,0,62,CHARLIE,"Okay. Excellent, just... thought I'd raise it."
0,0,63,CHARLIE (CONT'D),-- mind if I... bum one then? Thanks...
0,0,71,JACK,Excuse me!
0,0,72,JACK (CONT'D),D'y'ever use a needle?
0,0,73,KATE,... d-- what?
0,0,73,JACK,Have you ever patched up a pair of jeans?
0,0,73,KATE,... I... I made the drapes in my apartment--?
0,0,73,JACK,That's fantastic -- d'you have a second? I need a little help.
0,0,74,KATE,... help with what?
0,0,75,JACK,This.
0,0,76,JACK (CONT'D),I'd do it myself-- I'm a doctor -- but I just can't reach it.
0,0,76,KATE,You want me to sew that up.
0,0,76,JACK KATE,"It's just like drapes, same -- no, I used a sewing thing-- machine on the drapes--"
0,0,76,JACK,"You can do this, I'm telling you. If you wouldn't mind."
0,0,77,JACK (CONT'D),-- thank you --
0,0,78,JACK (CONT'D),It's for your hands.
0,0,79,JACK (CONT'D),Save some for me. The wound.
0,0,80,JACK (CONT'D),You're gonna have to sterilize the needle.
0,0,83,KATE,"Any, uh... color preference?"
0,0,84,JACK,Standard black.
0,0,85,KATE,So I might throw up on you.
0,0,85,JACK,You're doing fine.
0,0,86,JACK (CONT'D),You live in New York?
0,0,87,KATE,... I used to. I've been in New Zealand. About a year.
0,0,87,JACK,... how come?
0,0,87,KATE,"Oh, I just... had to get away."
0,0,87,JACK,So what were you doing in New Zealand?
0,0,87,KATE,Everything. Feels like.
0,0,87,JACK,Like what-- I'll appreciate any distraction.
0,0,87,KATE,"I was, uh... mixing paint for a while. At a hardware store. I worked for a veterinarian, in Lumsden."
0,0,87,JACK,Lumsden.
0,0,87,KATE,M-hm. I was an au pair for a few months. I worked on a farm--
0,0,88,JACK KATE,"... hey... hey, listen, I can -- no. No, I'm okay. get someone else to do this--"
0,0,89,KATE (CONT'D),You don't seem afraid at all. I don't understand that.
0,0,89,JACK,"Fear's sort of an odd thing. It's like an in-law who just drops in. You don't like it, but you can't just get rid of it. It's a struggle. But you have to learn to deal with it or it'll make you insane."
0,0,89,KATE,I haven't had much success with fear.
0,0,90,JACK,"When I was in residency, my first solo procedure was a spinal surgery on a sixteen year-old kid. Girl. At the end of it -- thirteen hours later - I was closing her up... and I... I accidentally ripped her dural sack -- you know what that is?"
0,0,91,JACK (CONT'D),"It's at the base of the spine, where all the nerves come together. Membrane as thin as tissue. So it ripped open -- the nerves just spilled out like angel hair pasta-- her spinal fluid flowing out and I just... froze. 'Cause I knew. If I didn't get those nerves back in that sack and sew it up... those thirteen hours were for nothing, that girl would be paralyzed. I had about a minute. And all the assistants were just watching me, I could feel their eyes. And the terror was so... crazy, so real... and I knew I had to deal with it. So I just made a choice. I'd let the fear in. Let it take over. Let it do its thing. But only for five seconds. That's all I was gonna give it. So I started to count to five. I could feel it inside -- like when you drink a milkshake on a hot day. One, two, three, four, five. And it was gone. I got back to work. Sewed her up. She was fine."
0,0,92,JACK (CONT'D),I think everyone has something like that. A moment where you establish your relationship with fear. And either you learn to deal with it... or you don't.
0,0,93,KATE,If that had been me... I think I would've run for the closest door.
0,0,93,JACK,"No, I don't think that's true. You're not running now."
0,0,99,SAYID,You! What's your name?
0,0,100,CHARLIE,-- what-- sorry-- Charlie.
0,0,100,SAYID,"Charlie, we need some help with the fire! No one will see it if it isn't big!"
0,0,100,CHARLIE,-- right! I'm on it! What's your name?
0,0,100,SAYID CHARLIE,"Sayid. -- Sayid! I am on it, Sayid!"
0,0,103,JIN,"I want you to stay in my sight at all times. If I walk away, you follow. We need to stay together, do you understand me? We cannot be apart. -- and as he continues, Hurley CROSSES FRAME -- we FOLLOW HIM NOW. He carries two dozen THAWED-OUT AIRPLANE MEALS. He arrives at:"
0,0,103,CLAIRE,"The pregnant woman, who sits in a disembodied Business Class chair on the beach. She rests comfortably. Relatively speaking, she's doing fine. Hurley offers her a meal:"
0,0,103,HURLEY,Hungry?
0,0,103,CLAIRE,-- yeah. Thank you.
0,0,103,HURLEY,"Any more, uh... you know, baby stuff?"
0,0,103,CLAIRE,No. No... I'm all right.
0,0,104,HURLEY,Hang in there.
0,0,104,CLAIRE,Yeah. You too.
0,0,107,SHANNON,As if I'm gonna start eating chocolate.
0,0,108,BOONE,How are your toenails coming.
0,0,108,SHANNON,"They're fine, thanks."
0,0,109,BOONE,"Shannon, we might be here a while."
0,0,109,SHANNON,I can go a day without eating if I have to.
0,0,109,BOONE,We might be here longer than a day.
0,0,109,SHANNON,"The plane had a black box, idiot. They know exactly where we are, they're coming. Lemme guess. You don't think they are."
0,0,109,BOONE,"No, I'm pretty sure they're not."
0,0,109,SHANNON,Why.
0,0,109,BOONE,Because you're so sure they are.
0,0,109,SHANNON,You're such an ass.
0,0,109,BOONE,"While that may be true, I am still -- I swear to God for reasons I will never understand -- concerned about your survival."
0,0,110,SHANNON,I'll eat on the rescue boat.
0,0,112,HURLEY,We got chicken or lasagna.
0,0,113,HURLEY (CONT'D),"They're not cooked, but they can't be worse cold than they were heated."
0,0,114,HURLEY (CONT'D),Hello?
0,0,115,HURLEY (CONT'D),"Okay, you too."
0,0,117,KATE,-- why aren't you removing that?
0,0,117,JACK,Because it could be holding his stomach together. Pulling this out could cause more damage than leaving it until help comes. His head wound's bad too.
0,0,117,KATE,... is he gonna live?
0,0,117,JACK,I could tell you a lot more if there was a CAT scan around.
0,0,118,JACK (CONT'D),... do you know him?
0,0,118,KATE,... he was sitting next to me.
0,0,121,MICHAEL,Hey. Walt. Sure you're warm enough?
0,0,121,WALT,... yeah.
0,0,122,MICHAEL,Love you.
0,0,124,JACK (O.S.),"We must've been close to 40,000 feet when it happened."
0,0,125,JACK (O.S.) (CONT'D),When we hit a pocket of dead air.
0,0,127,JACK,We dropped. Must've been two-hundred feet. The turbulence that followed... by far the worst I've ever been through... but turbulence doesn't bring down planes.
0,0,127,JAC K (CONT'D),Electrical power came in and out. Sounded like the hydraulics went out. It was pretty clear what was happening. How long would you say that lasted?
0,0,127,KATE,... five minutes?
0,0,127,JACK,"Yeah, that's what I was thinking... There was too much stress on the structure of the plane. That's when the tail broke away."
0,0,128,JACK (CONT'D),-- we were out of control. We actually went up for a while. Then dropping... flipping... What row where you in?
0,0,131,KATE,I didn't. I saw the whole thing. We were falling... I knew the tail was gone. I couldn't make myself look back. Then the... the front section came apart.
0,0,132,JACK,-- did it hit something?
0,0,132,KATE,It might have. We crashed maybe five seconds later.
0,0,133,JACK,The front end of the fuselage isn't on the beach. Neither's the tail. I woke up about five hundred yards away from the beach... must've fallen out while the fuselage was cartwheeling... We need to figure out which way we came in.
0,0,133,KATE,Why.
0,0,133,JACK,"Because there's a chance we could find the cockpit. If it's still intact, there could be a transceiver. That would let us send a signal, help a rescue party find us."
0,0,133,KATE,How do you know all that?
0,0,133,JACK,I took a couple of flying lessons. Wasn't for me.
0,0,133,KATE,"I saw some smoke. From the beach -- about a mile inland. -- through the valley. From the jungle, there."
0,0,133,JACK,-- where?
0,0,134,KATE,"If you're going for the cockpit, I'm going with you. We'll leave as soon as it's light."
0,0,135,JACK,I don't know your name.
0,0,135,KATE,I'm Kate.
0,0,135,JACK,Jack. So what were you doing in Sydney?
0,0,136,KATE,I was just flying through. I've been in New Zealand.
0,0,136,JACK,Yeah? Doing what?
0,0,136,KATE,"Everything. Feels like. I was, uh... mixing paint for a while. At a hardware store. I worked for a veterinarian, in Lumsden."
0,0,136,JACK,Lumsden.
0,0,136,KATE,"So what's up with the tattoos, Jack? You one of those really hardcore spinal surgeons or what?"
0,0,138,OTHER SURVIVORS,"Turn in the distance, looking, scared as Kate enters frame in FOREGROUND -- in"
0,0,138,KATE,... what was that...?
0,0,141,WALT,-- I think that's Vincent --
0,0,141,MICHAEL,-- that's not Vincent --
0,0,142,CLAIRE,-- did anyone hear that sound--?
0,0,143,HURLEY,"... I think, uh... unfortunately all of us did."
0,0,146,SHANNON,-- okay... this isn't funny--
0,0,147,SHANNON (CONT'D),-- Boone -- wait--!
0,0,151,CHARLIE,Terrific.
0,0,155,JACK,It's good.
0,0,156,JACK,It's not a very strong drink.
0,0,157,FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1,Shh.
0,0,157,JACK,This of course breaks some critical FAA regulations --
0,0,157,FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1,I saw you when you got on. Giving your first class ticket to that older lady.
0,0,157,JACK,"Oh, I wasn't being sweet. She guilted me into it. She's like six-hundred years old and says she's never flown before."
0,0,157,JAC K (CONT'D),Come on.
0,0,157,FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1,You think it's all an act?
0,0,157,JACK,I'm pretty sure.
0,0,160,CHARLIE,Sorry...
0,0,160,ROSE,Guess he really had to go.
0,0,164,JACK,It's normal.
0,0,164,ROSE,"... oh, I know. I've just never been a good flier. My husband always reminds me that planes want to be in the air."
0,0,164,JACK,Well he sounds like a smart man.
0,0,164,ROSE,You be sure and tell him that when he gets back from the bathroom.
0,0,165,JACK,"I'll keep you company 'til he does. Don't worry, it'll be over in a --"
0,0,167,MICHAEL,"It wasn't natural, whatever it was..."
0,0,167,ROSE,"-- that sound it made -- I keep thinking, there was something familiar about it."
0,0,167,SHANNON,Really? Where are you from?
0,0,167,ROSE,The Bronx.
0,0,167,CHARLIE,It could've been something like monkeys.
0,0,167,SAWYER,"Yeah, I'm sure it was monkeys. It's Monkey Island."
0,0,167,HURLEY,"Technically, you know, we don't even know if we're on an island --"
0,0,167,SAYID,We're on an island.
0,0,168,KATE,You ready?
0,0,169,JACK,"Kate, you showed me where the smoke was. I can get there myself--"
0,0,169,KATE,I'm coming with you.
0,0,169,JACK,I want you to stay here.
0,0,169,KATE,-- no.
0,0,169,JACK,We don't know what the terrain's gonna be. You're safer if you--
0,0,169,KATE,"I can't prove to you that I'm up for it. All I can say is my gym had a rock climbing wall -- and yeah, I realize how pathetic that sounds. I'm going with you."
0,0,170,JACK,You're gonna need better shoes.
0,0,173,CHARLIE,-- anyone have any sunscreen?
0,0,173,SHANNON,"Yeah, I do."
0,0,173,HURLEY,"So I was just looking inside the fuselage. It's pretty grim in there. You think we should be doing anything about the, uh..."
0,0,174,MICHAEL,"What are you spelling, man, ""Bodies""?"
0,0,174,SHANNON,They'll deal with 'em. When they get here.
0,0,174,CHARLIE,
0,0,174,SHANNON,Fine.
0,0,175,JACK,"I'm going to look for the cockpit. See if we can find a transceiver to send out a distress signal. Help out the rescue team. You're gonna need to keep an eye on the wounded. If that guy in the suit wakes up, try to keep him calm -- don't let him remove that piece of shrapnel. You understand?"
0,0,175,BOONE,What about the guy with the leg? Your tourniquet --
0,0,175,JACK,Stopped the bleeding. I took it off last night. He'll be all right.
0,0,175,BOONE,"-- yeah, okay. Cool -- uh, good job."
0,0,175,CHARLIE,"-- hey, I'm coming with-- I wanna help--"
0,0,175,JACK,-- I don't need anymore help--
0,0,175,CHARLIE,"No, I wanna go, I'm not too keen on keeping still--"
0,0,176,SAWYER,"Yeah, this is genius. Going into the jungle? After that sound last night? The thing that moved those trees? Yeah, this is a great idea."
0,0,177,KATE,-- what's going on?
0,0,177,JACK,-- nothing--
0,0,177,SAWYER,When they show up to rescue us while you're gone? We're not waiting around.
0,0,177,JACK,Let's go.
0,0,177,CHARLIE,"-- oh, she's coming too? Excellent."
0,0,180,KATE,You mind if I ask you something?
0,0,180,CHARLIE,"Me? No, I'd be thrilled -- I've been waiting."
0,0,180,KATE,Have we ever met anywhere?
0,0,180,CHARLIE,Nah. That would be unlikely.
0,0,180,KATE,Hm.
0,0,181,CHARLIE,I look familiar though.
0,0,181,KATE,Yeah.
0,0,181,CHARLIE,You can't quite place it.
0,0,181,KATE,"No, I can't."
0,0,181,CHARLIE,"Yeah. Yeah, I think I know."
0,0,181,KATE,... you do?
0,0,182,CHARLIE,"""Till the ennnnnd of time! You know you thought you would be caught -- Till the ennnnd of time...!"""
0,0,183,CHARLIE (CONT'D),You still don't get it? You never heard that song?
0,0,183,KATE,"-- of course I've heard it, I just don't know what the hell that has to--"
0,0,183,CHARLIE (CONT'D),-- well that's why I'm-- that's us! Drive Shaft!
0,0,183,KATE,-- what?
0,0,183,CHARLIE,God -- have you never heard of bloody Drive Shaft?
0,0,183,KATE,The band?
0,0,187,CHARLIE,"Yes, the band!"
0,0,190,KATE,You know Drive Shaft?
0,0,191,KATE (CONT'D),They were good.
0,0,191,CHARLIE,"-- you don't have to keep using the past tense, you know. We're still together. In fact, I'm supposed to be in the middle of a comeback. So..."
0,0,192,REVERSE ANGLE,Through the overgrown bushes -- something's watching them. It's the WHITE LAB from the opening...
0,0,193,CHARLIE,This-- is this normal...?
0,0,195,JIN,There's no more room here! Over there! There's room over there!
0,0,197,HURLEY,"I'm telling you, you don't wanna go in there! Too many bodies!"
0,0,200,SAYID,I need to put up the other side!
0,0,200,SAWYER,"Yeah, I'm all right in here, Osama."
0,0,201,SAYID,... what did you call me?
0,0,202,CLAIRE,"-- look-- oh God, look, out there --"
0,0,203,ROSE,... that's the way the doctor went...
0,0,207,KATE,
0,0,210,CHARLIE,"Let's find your transgizmo and get outta here, yeah?"
0,0,214,CHARLIE (CONT'D),God... this is horrible...
0,0,216,JACK,-- get back...
0,0,217,JACK (CONT'D),Come on-- come on-- COME ON!
0,0,220,JACK,You okay?
0,0,220,KATE,"-- yeah, you?"
0,0,220,CHARLIE,I'm all right! FYI-- I'm good...
0,0,223,JACK,-- you don't have to come up here--
0,0,223,KATE,"-- no, I'm good."
0,0,224,KATE (CONT'D),-- so what does a transceiver look like?
0,0,224,JACK,-- like a complicated walkie talkie.
0,0,225,JACK (CONT'D),-- hey-- can you hear me? -- I need the water --
0,0,225,PILOT,-- what-- wh--
0,0,226,PILOT,-- how many-- survived?
0,0,226,JACK,At least forty-eight. Including you. -- anything feel broken?
0,0,227,PILOT,Head hurts -- dizzy...
0,0,227,JACK,Probably a concussion.
0,0,227,PILOT,-- how long has it been?
0,0,227,JACK,Sixteen hours.
0,0,227,PILOT,-- sixteen... -- has anyone come?
0,0,227,JACK,Not yet.
0,0,228,PILOT,Six hours in. Our radio went out. The redundant system... the transponder -- wasn't functioning. No one could see us. So we turned back. To land in Fiji. When we hit that turbulence... we were over a thousand miles off course -- They'll be looking in the wrong place.
0,0,229,PILOT (CONT'D),We have a transceiver--
0,0,229,JACK,"-- good, that's what we were hoping --"
0,0,230,JACK (CONT'D),You shouldn't try to...
0,0,230,PILOT,I'm all right. Transceiver's in there.
0,0,231,JACK,-- where's Charlie?
0,0,232,PILOT,-- it's not working...
0,0,234,KATE,"-- hey, what're you d--?"
0,0,235,CHARLIE,-- what? Nothing --
0,0,237,PILOT,-- what the hell was that?
0,0,237,JACK,Kate!
0,0,238,KATE,-- it's right outside --
0,0,238,PILOT,-- what's righ--?
0,0,238,JACK,-- shh!
0,0,241,JACK (CONT'D),-- I wouldn't do that.
0,0,241,PILOT,-- good to know.
0,0,243,KATE,... do you s--
0,0,245,JACK,No...
0,0,252,CHARLIE,Runs through THICK TANGLED ROOTS and WIPES OUT -- coming down HARD -- WIND knocked out of him -- he tries to get up but CAN'T -- suddenly JACK is there to help him up --
0,0,253,KATE,"Still running, up ahead -- CRYING as she runs through the rain -- almost losing her footing, but not -- distant SCREAMS OVERWHELMED by a THUNDERCLAP and Kate SCREAMS as she runs:"
0,0,256,KATE (CONT'D),One... two... three... four...
0,0,262,CHARLIE,-- I don't know!
0,0,265,CHARLIE,"-- he pulled me up. If he hadn't, that th-"
0,0,265,KATE,-- did you see it?
0,0,265,CHARLIE,No. No. But it was right behind us. We were dead -- I was. Until Jack came back for me.
0,0,266,KATE,We have to go back for him.
0,0,266,CHARLIE,Go back? There? Love -- listen -- there's a certain... gargantuan quality to whatever the hell that thing is --
0,0,267,KATE,-- then don't come.
0,0,272,CHARLIE,... what the hell's that...?
0,0,273,JACK (O.S.),It's the pilot.
0,0,274,KATE,-- did you see it?
0,0,274,JACK,"No. It was right behind me, I dove into the bushes."
0,0,275,CHARLIE,"... excuse me, people... but... how the hell does something like that happen...?"
0,0,277,CHARLIE,Anything?
0,0,277,JACK,... you keep asking me if there's anything.
0,0,277,CHARLIE,"Pardon me for appearing desperate, but in case you didn't hear the pilot before he was eaten, they're never going to find us unless we get that thing to work. So is there anything?"
0,0,277,JACK,No.
0,0,277,KATE,What were you doing. In the bathroom.
0,0,277,CHARLIE,"Oh, I thought you could tell. I was getting sick. Puking. My one...tangible contribution to this trek."
0,0,277,KATE,"No, I'm glad you came."
0,0,277,CHARLIE,"Yeah, every trek needs a coward."
0,0,277,KATE,You're not a coward.
0,0,280,CHARLIE,"Yeah -- I'm good, thanks."
0,0,281,CHARLIE,I'm fine. Thank you. Please.
0,0,290,FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1,Sir? Excuse me --
0,0,291,CHARLIE,Sorry...
0,0,292,ROSE (O.S.),Guess he really had to go.
0,0,293,CHARLIE,-- bugger--
0,0,296,FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1 (O.S.),Sir? Are you all right?
0,0,297,FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1 (O.S.),"Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to open the door..."
0,0,298,FLIGHT ATTENDANT #2 - MALE (O.S.),"Open the door now, sir."
0,0,309,SHANNON,Not really.
0,0,310,CLAIRE (O.S.),Is that your boyfriend?
0,0,311,SHANNON,My brother. Boone. God's friggin' gift to humanity.
0,0,312,SHANNON (CONT'D),Do you know what it is? A beat for Claire.
0,0,312,CLAIRE,Not yet. ... I haven't felt the baby kick since yesterday.
0,0,317,MICHAEL (O.S.),Excuse me.
0,0,318,MICHAEL (CONT'D),Have you seen my boy?
0,0,319,SUN,My apologies... but I do not speak English.
0,0,320,JIN,"Your top button is undone! Button it, please, right now!"
0,0,321,MICHAEL,"... I'm, uh... I'm sorry... And Michael walks off."
0,0,322,WALT (O.S.),Vincent! Vincent!
0,0,323,WALT (CONT'D),Vincent!
0,0,325,MICHAEL (O.S.),Hey!
0,0,326,MICHAEL (CONT'D),"--What did I tell you? -- after everything that's happened - I told you to stay on the beach. -- no, don't do this"
0,0,329,WALT,-- I thought maybe Vincent would be around--
0,0,330,WALT (CONT'D),... I just found' em.
0,0,338,JIN,I have food. Here. Try this.
0,0,339,HURLEY,S'up.
0,0,339,JIN,"Try this. Sea urchin, it's good, it'll keep you alive."
0,0,340,HURLEY,"-- what. That? What, eat that?"
0,0,340,JIN,"It's food, there's enough for everybody."
0,0,340,HURLEY,"Dude, guess what, I'm starving. But I am not nearly that hungry. No. Thank you. No way. No."
0,0,343,MICHAEL,... that comic's in Spanish. ... d'you... read Spanish--?
0,0,343,WALT,No. I found it.
0,0,344,MICHAEL,"Esta ese libro bueno, pequeño hombre? That was... I was kidding. Tell me about your school-- you go to school?"
0,0,344,WALT,"Yeah, I go to school."
0,0,344,MICHAEL,... though maybe 'cause you travelled so much that y--
0,0,344,WALT,I go to school.
0,0,345,MICHAEL,Tell you what. When we get home... I'll get you another dog.
0,0,347,SAYID,"The others. They've heard about the thing you saw. The pilot. I understand why you and the doctor decided not to frighten us, but your English friend is telling anyone who will listen. They think we are insane for going back in there."
0,0,348,KATE,"If he told you about the pilot, he told you what the pilot said. The rescue people -- they're looking in the wrong place. They're not gonna find us."
0,0,349,SAYID,"I don't like it here. But you... you don't like it here even more than I do. I agree, sending a signal from high ground -- this is something we need to do. But your... willingness to go back in. After you saw... whatever it is you saw. It is either impressive. Brave. Or something else... I can't really understand."
0,0,355,BOONE,... what the hell are you doing.
0,0,356,SHANNON,... I think I was mean to him.
0,0,356,BOONE,... what?
0,0,356,SHANNON,He was the guy.
0,0,356,BOONE,What guy?
0,0,356,SHANNON,The guy at the gate. The guy who wouldn't give us our seats. In first class.
0,0,357,SHANNON (CONT'D),Remember him?
0,0,358,SHANNON (CONT'D),He saved our lives.
0,0,359,BOONE,"Shannon, come on, we're trying to clear the wreckage why don't you help out."
0,0,360,BOONE (CONT'D),"Come on, you're being worthless over here."
0,0,361,SHANNON,... I'm being what?
0,0,361,BOONE,"-- well come on, you're sitting on your ass staring at bodies -- that isn't--"
0,0,361,SHANNON,"Hey, I've been through a trauma, okay--?!"
0,0,361,BOONE,-- we've all been through a trauma! The difference is that since the crash you've actually given yourself a pedicure!
0,0,361,SHANNON,"You know what? It's so easy to make fun of me-- and you're good at it, I get it-- well screw you -- you don't know the first thing about what I'm thinking-- -- no you don't!"
0,0,361,BOONE,-- I'd rather not waste my time making fun of you!
0,0,364,SHANNON,I'm going with them. On the hike.
0,0,365,SHANNON (CONT'D),I'm going.
0,0,365,BOONE,Oh yeah?
0,0,365,SHANNON,Yup.
0,0,366,BOONE,-- no you're not. Shannon!
0,0,367,SHANNON,I'd like to come with you.
0,0,367,KATE,"Thanks, but we're--"
0,0,367,BOONE,She's not going. -- she doesn't want to go -- she does this--
0,0,367,SHANNON,-- the hell I'm not--
0,0,368,BOONE,She postures -- makes choices just to infuriate her family-- which at the moment is me --
0,0,368,SHANNON,Shut-up and stop trying to be charming-- I'm coming with you.
0,0,368,KATE,I'm not sure that's a good idea--
0,0,368,SHANNON,"What're you -- like, two years older than me? Please. You're going, right?"
0,0,368,CHARLIE,"-- where, on the hike? Are you?"
0,0,368,SHANNON,Yup.
0,0,368,CHARLIE,"-- yes, I'm going. Definitely."
0,0,368,KATE,"Look, everybody can come. But we're leaving now."
0,0,369,CHARLIE,"You couldn't tell from that, but she's quite nice, really."
0,0,380,KATE,Decided to join us--?
0,0,380,SAWYER,"Yeah, looks like it."
0,0,380,KATE,What changed your mind?
0,0,380,SAWYER,"I'm a complex guy, Sweetheart."
0,0,383,CHARLIE,Y'ever heard of Drive Shaft?
0,0,383,SHANNON,"... what, the band?"
0,0,383,CHARLIE,Yeah.
0,0,383,SHANNON,Yuchhh.
0,0,383,CHARLIE,Right.
0,0,383,SHANNON,Why?
0,0,383,CHARLIE,Nothing. Horrible.
0,0,383,SHANNON,Do you have one of their songs stuck in your head--
0,0,383,CHARLIE,"-- uh, yeah, sort of--"
0,0,383,SHANNON,"God, I'm sorry."
0,0,383,CHARLIE,Yeah. Me too.
0,0,384,JACK,I need some help.
0,0,384,HURLEY,-- okay --
0,0,384,JACK,"I need you to help me go through the luggage -- I need any prescription medication you can find -- especially any drugs that end with ""mycin"" or ""cillin""-- those are antibiotics--"
0,0,384,HURLEY,-- what's this for?
0,0,384,JACK,Please just do it-- you'll see.
0,0,384,INSERT,
0,0,385,JACK,... how's your son?
0,0,386,MICHAEL,"Walt? Yeah, I think he'll be all right."
0,0,386,JACK,How old is he?
0,0,386,MICHAEL,Eight. Nine.
0,0,387,MICHAEL (CONT'D),"Walt's more worried about his dog than anything. It was on the plane, so... Kids, you know. They're--"
0,0,387,JACK,Was it a white lab?
0,0,387,MICHAEL,... yeah.
0,0,387,JACK,"-- yeah, I saw him yesterday. In the jungle."
0,0,387,MICHAEL,-- what? Where?
0,0,387,JACK,"Over there, hundred yards in or so. He looked good."
0,0,388,MICHAEL,-- what was that thing you saw. In the jungle -- what was it?
0,0,389,JACK,I have no idea.
0,0,392,LOCKE,Do you play?
0,0,393,WALT,Nope. ... what is it? Is it like Checkers?
0,0,394,LOCKE,Not really. It's a better game than Checkers.
0,0,395,LOCKE (CONT'D),Do you play checkers with your pop?
0,0,395,WALT,No. I was in Australia with my mom.
0,0,395,LOCKE,You have no accent.
0,0,395,WALT,"Yeah, we move a lot. She got sick. She died. So."
0,0,396,LOCKE,You're having a rough month.
0,0,397,LOCKE (CONT'D),Backgammon is the oldest game in the world. Much older than chess. Archaeologists found sets when they excavated the ruins of Ancient Mesopotamia. Would you like to guess how old they were?
0,0,397,WALT,A hundred years?
0,0,397,LOCKE,Five thousand years.
0,0,397,WALT,... five thousand...
0,0,397,LOCKE,... that's older than Jesus Christ.
0,0,398,WALT,Did they have dice and stuff?
0,0,398,LOCKE,Yes. But theirs weren't made of plastic. Their dice were made of bones.
0,0,398,WALT,Cool.
0,0,399,LOCKE,"The Persians called it ""Takhteh Nard"" which means ""Battle on Wood""."
0,0,399,LOC KE (CONT'D),Two players. Two sides. One is light. One is dark.
0,0,400,LOCKE (CONT'D),Walt. ... you wanna know a secret?
0,0,403,CLAIRE,... oh. No thank you.
0,0,404,JIN,"You will need to eat -- especially you, you should have some."
0,0,405,JIN (CONT'D),"It's good, isn't it?"
0,0,407,CLAIRE,-- oh my God--
0,0,407,JIN,-- what is it? Are you-- are you okay?
0,0,408,CLAIRE,-- I felt it! Come here-- feel this!
0,0,409,CLAIRE (CONT'D),"-- do you feel that?! Feel that! It's a kick! That's a foot! Right there-- no wait, it's moving-- he's moving around-- he... I guess I think it's a he..."
0,0,409,JIN,"-- excuse me, that's okay, I don't need to-- I would rather not-- no, that's all right, please let go of my hand--"
0,0,410,CLAIRE (CONT'D),-- I felt you-- thank you-- thank you!
0,0,411,SAWYER,Okay. Wide open space. You should check the radio -- see if we're good.
0,0,411,SAYID,We're not gonna have any reception yet--
0,0,411,SAWYER,-- tell you what -- just try it.
0,0,411,SAYID,I don't want to waste the batteries--
0,0,411,SAWYER,-- I'm not asking you to keep it on all day--
0,0,411,SAYID,-- we're still blocked by the mountain--
0,0,411,SAWYER,-- just check the damn radio!
0,0,411,SAYID,"If I just CHECK, we might not have any juice left when we get to--"
0,0,412,BOONE,-- the hell's that?
0,0,412,SHANNON,-- oh God--
0,0,413,KATE,... something's coming --
0,0,416,CHARLIE,"-- coming towards us, I think...?"
0,0,425,SHANNON,... that's... that's a big bear.
0,0,425,BOONE,-- you think... that's what killed the pilot?
0,0,426,CHARLIE,"That? No. No, that's maybe a little tiny preemie baby version-- this is nothing compared to that--"
0,0,426,KATE,Guys? This isn't just a bear. It's a polar bear.
0,0,429,HURLEY,You sure he's out?
0,0,429,JACK,He's out.
0,0,429,HURLEY,How do you know he won't wake up when you pull that thing out?
0,0,429,JACK,I don't.
0,0,430,HURLEY,"Hey, guy -- you awake? Yo! There's a rescue Plane! Hey! Yeah, he's out."
0,0,431,HURLEY (CONT'D),... so what do I--?
0,0,431,JACK,"It's unlikely he'll regain consciousness, but the pain might bring him around. If it does... I need you to hold him down."
0,0,431,HURLEY,"Uh -- I'm not so good around blood, man."
0,0,431,JACK,Then don't look.
0,0,431,HURLEY,Yeah. But I'm not so good around blood.
0,0,431,JACK,"Just do your best, okay?"
0,0,432,HURLEY,"Shouldn't you like, wash your hands?"
0,0,432,JACK,"I did. But he'll probably get infected no matter what I do. He lives, we just hope the antibiotics work. Don't look."
0,0,432,HURLEY,Okay...
0,0,434,HURLEY,Dude...
0,0,434,JACK,Hand me those strips--
0,0,435,HURLEY,Dude.
0,0,437,JACK,Just hand me the strips -- I need to get this blood -- -- Oh.
0,0,439,JACK,Hey! Don't even think about-- HURLEY!
0,0,440,JACK (CONT'D),Dammit.
0,0,442,BOONE,... that can't... be a polar be--
0,0,442,KATE,It's a polar bear.
0,0,442,SAWYER,It's a polar bear.
0,0,442,SHANNON,"Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I never... finished college. But... polar bears don't... normally live in the jungle, right--?"
0,0,442,CHARLIE,"Yeah, spot-on. No, they don't. This is a freakshow--"
0,0,442,KATE,Have you ever heard of anything like this?
0,0,442,SAYID,"No, this is, uh... polar bears don't live near this far south--"
0,0,442,BOONE,... this one does.
0,0,442,SAWYER,Did. Did. You're welcome for that.
0,0,443,KATE,Where did that come from.
0,0,443,SAWYER,Prob'ly Bear Village. How the hell do I know--?
0,0,443,KATE,"Not the bear, the gun."
0,0,443,SAWYER,I got it off one of the bodies.
0,0,443,SAYID,One of the bodies.
0,0,443,SAWYER,"Yeah, one of the bodies."
0,0,443,SHANNON,People don't carry guns on planes!
0,0,443,SAWYER,They do if they're a U.S. Marshal! There was one on the plane--
0,0,443,KATE,-- how do you know that?!
0,0,443,SAWYER,"'Cause I saw a guy lying there with an ankle holster-- so I took the gun, thought it might come in handy, guess what, it did!"
0,0,443,KATE,-- why do you think he was a Marshal?
0,0,443,SAWYER,"Because he had a clip-on badge! Took that too! Thought it was cool! Listen, Sweetheart, you should be kissing my ass after what I just did for you!"
0,0,443,SAYID,I know who you are. You're the prisoner.
0,0,443,SAWYER,... I'm the what?
0,0,443,SAYID,"You found a gun on a U.S. Marshal? Yes, I believe you did. You knew it was there because you were the one he was bringing back to the States. Those handcuffs were on you. That's how you knew there was a gun --"
0,0,443,SAWYER,"Hey, guess what, screw you!"
0,0,443,SAYID,"That's who you are, you son-of-a-bitch!"
0,0,443,SAWYER,Be as suspicious of me as I am of you-- go ahead!
0,0,443,SAYID,"You accuse me, but you are the prisoner!"
0,0,443,SAWYER,"-- fine, I'm the criminal! You're the terrorist, we can all play a part! Who do you wanna be--? I'll tell ya what you should be!"
0,0,445,KATE,Who knows how to use a gun?
0,0,445,CHARLIE,"I think you just pull the trigger. But Kate, we just escaped death, let's not push our luck--"
0,0,445,KATE,I want to take it apart.
0,0,445,CHARLIE,-- oh--
0,0,445,SAYID,"There's a button on the grip -- push that, it will eject the magazine."
0,0,446,SAYID (CONT'D),"But there's still a round in the chamber - hold the grip, pull back on the top part of the gun --"
0,0,447,SAWYER,I know your type.
0,0,447,KATE,I'm not so sure.
0,0,447,SAWYER,"Yeah, I've been with girls like you."
0,0,447,KATE,Not girls exactly like me.
0,0,452,KATE,"No, I'm fine with this, thank you."
0,0,454,MAN,"I'll have a coffee, sweetheart."
0,0,456,MAN,"You look worried. I'd be worried too, I was you."
0,0,457,MAN (CONT'D),Hey -- look at the bright side. There's an off-chance they'll believe your story. I sure know I do.
0,0,458,KATE,It doesn't matter to me what you believe.
0,0,459,MAN,Well that sure is true. Always has been. You sure you don't want another soda?
0,0,459,KATE,"Yeah, thanks."
0,0,461,FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S VOICE,"Ladies and gentleman, the pilot has turned on the fasten seatbelts sign -- please return to your seats with your seatbelts fastened..."
0,0,462,KATE,I have one favor to ask.
0,0,462,MAN,This oughta be good. Wh--
0,0,464,SAYID,-- we should keep moving.
0,0,468,SHRAPNEL MAN,Gah ---
0,0,469,JACK,-- no --
0,0,470,JACK (CONT'D),What? I can't...
0,0,474,MICHAEL (O.S.),Walt!
0,0,475,MICHAEL (CONT'D),You looking for this?
0,0,484,SAWYER,"Oh. Now it's a good time to check the radio. Not before, but now."
0,0,484,SAYID,We're up higher.
0,0,484,SAWYER,Yes we are.
0,0,486,SAYID,"-- bar-- bar, there's a bar--"
0,0,487,SAYID (CONT'D),-- mayday mayday--
0,0,488,KATE,-- what's that?
0,0,490,SAYID,-- feedback--
0,0,491,SAWYER,I'll tell you what would do that. This guy not fixing the radio-- the thing doesn't work --
0,0,492,SAYID,"No -- no, it's not broken... We can't transmit because something's already transmitting."
0,0,493,SHANNON,What?
0,0,493,CHARLIE,Transmitting from where?
0,0,493,SAYID (CONT'D),Somewhere close -- the signal's strong --
0,0,493,CHARLIE,Close? You mean here on the island close? That's fantastic!
0,0,493,BOONE,Maybe it's other survivors --
0,0,493,SHANNON,From our plane? How --
0,0,493,SAWYER,"So what kind of ""transmission"" is it?"
0,0,493,SAYID,Could be a Satphone -- maybe a radio signal...
0,0,494,KATE,Can we listen to it?
0,0,494,SAYID,I don't know what frequency the signal is - hold on --
0,0,495,SAWYER,-- there's no transmission--
0,0,495,KATE,"Sawyer, shut-up--"
0,0,495,CHARLIE,It's the rescue crew -- it must be --
0,0,496,FEMALE VOICE (V.O.),... Il est dehors... Il est dehors et Brennan pris les clefs!
0,0,496,CHARLIE,-- That's French. The French are coming! I've never been so grateful for the French --
0,0,497,KATE,I never took French -- What's she saying?
0,0,497,FEMALE VOICE (V.O.),-- veuillez nous aider... Ils sont morts
0,0,498,SAYID,-- does anyone speak French?
0,0,499,BOONE,She does.
0,0,500,SHANNON,What?!? No I don't...
0,0,501,MALE VOICE (V.O.),Iteration one seven two nine four five three one.
0,0,501,CHARLIE,Right then -- what was that?
0,0,502,SAYID,-- nonono--
0,0,503,KATE,"-- what? ""Nonono"" what?"
0,0,503,BOONE,
0,0,504,KATE,How much time do we -- ?
0,0,504,SAYID,-- not much --
0,0,504,SAWYER,You're telling me no one here speaks French?!?
0,0,504,CHARLIE,-- that voice -- that's weird --
0,0,504,MALE VOICE (V.O.),Iteration one seven two nine four five three two.
0,0,505,FEMALE VOICE (V.O.),-- nous aider... Ils sont morts --
0,0,505,SHANNON,It's-- it's repeating--
0,0,505,SAYID,"-- Yes, she's right -- It's a loop. ""Iteration."" It's repeating the same message. It's a counter -- the next number will end five three three."
0,0,506,MALE VOICE (V.O.),Iteration one seven two nine four five three three.
0,0,507,SAWYER,Does anyone understand what the hell he's talking about?
0,0,507,SAYID,"It's a running count. Of the number of times the message has repeated. It's roughly thirty seconds long, so..."
0,0,508,SAWYER,"Don't forget to carry the one, chief."
0,0,508,CHARLIE,"-- guys, the battery--"
0,0,508,KATE,Give him a minute.
0,0,509,BOONE,"-- C'mon, Shan --what's she saying? Try."
0,0,509,FEMALE VOICE (V.O.),Si n'importe qui peut entendre ceci -- veuillez nous aider...
0,0,509,SHANNON,"-- I don't know -- I think she's saying ""Please."" She's saying ""Please help me. Please come get me."""
0,0,509,SAWYER,Or she's not! You don't speak French!
0,0,509,KATE,Let her listen.
0,0,509,FEMALE VOICE (V.O.),Il les a tues. Il les a tues tous.
0,0,510,CHARLIE,What? What is it?
0,0,511,SHANNON,"""Please help... I'm alone now... on the island alone. Someone please come... the others, they're dead. It killed them. It killed them all."""
