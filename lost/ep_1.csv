0,1,17,MICHAEL,"Walt, ya gotta keep that dog quiet."
0,1,17,WALT,"I dunno what's the matter with him. C'mon, Vincent-- Cut it out..."
0,1,18,MICHAEL,Sorry...
0,1,21,KATE,What is it?
0,1,23,CLAIRE,Somebody's in there.
0,1,23,SAYID,Everybody in there's dead.
0,1,23,JACK,Sawyer.
0,1,23,SAWYER (O.S.),"Standing right behind you, jackass."
0,1,24,KATE,Jack...?
0,1,28,SAWYER,How `bout I shed a little light on--
0,1,32,JACK,Run.
0,1,33,JACK,No!
0,1,36,HURLEY,"Aww crud, now what?"
0,1,37,JIN,Stay down.
0,1,39,CHARLIE,Hey-- Oww!
0,1,43,SAYID,It's alright! They're gone!
0,1,44,BOONE,You okay?
0,1,44,SHANNON,"Yeah. Way to go, Ace."
0,1,45,CHARLIE,What the bloody hell was it?
0,1,46,LOCKE,Boars.
0,1,46,JACK,We have to get rid of the bodies.
0,1,47,CHARLIE,"What, bury them? There's a whole bunch in there--"
0,1,47,SAYID,More than twenty. Digging will be difficult without shovels or--
0,1,47,JACK,Not bury. We have to burn them.
0,1,48,JACK (CONT'D),What?
0,1,48,KATE JACK,"They're people. -- I know they're people, Kate..."
0,1,48,SAYID,Burning the remains... They deserve better than--
0,1,48,JACK,"Than what? Getting eaten by wild animals? `Cause that's what's gonna happen. Any bodies we bury won't stay buried for long. Look, I know it seems harsh. But that fuselage, in the sun, it's not about what they deserve... They're gone. And we're not."
0,1,49,SAYID,"What you say may be true. But it's not right. For us to decide how these people are laid to rest, with no regard to their own wishes -- their religions-"
0,1,49,JACK,We don't have time to sort out everybody's God.
0,1,49,CHARLIE,"Really? Last I heard, we're positively made of time."
0,1,49,KATE CHARLIE,Charlie... -- What? I'm just saying...
0,1,49,JACK,"Hey, I'm not happy about it either. But the plane crashed a thousand miles off-course. They're looking for us in the wrong place. If they're even still looking. It's been four days. Nobody's coming."
0,1,50,JACK (CONT'D),"In the morning, we need everybody to start collecting wood... Dried brush... We're going in turn that fuselage into a furnace."
0,1,50,KATE,"Crematorium, you mean."
0,1,51,JACK,We'll wait until the sun goes down tomorrow night to set the fire.
0,1,52,CHARLIE,"If he's so eager to get this done, why're we waiting `til..."
0,1,52,KATE,He's hoping somebody'll see it.
0,1,56,KATE (O.S.),Guess I'm not the only one who didn't sleep last night.
0,1,57,SAYID,There are better uses for my time than collecting firewood.
0,1,57,KATE,You don't agree with Jack.
0,1,58,KATE (CONT'D),What're you making?
0,1,58,SAYID,Too soon to talk about. Not sure if it'll even work.
0,1,58,KATE,"You're trying to pick up the signal, aren't you? The one we heard on the transceiver."
0,1,59,SAYID,"If the French woman's transmissions have truly been playing on a loop for sixteen years, then there must be a power source on this island. A significant one."
0,1,59,KATE,You can find it?
0,1,59,SAYID,"Hypothetically... yes. I'm making an antenna, of sorts. With a few of these mounted at different points on the island, I may be able to use the transceiver to triangulate the signal. Find out where it's coming from."
0,1,59,KATE,What can I do to help?
0,1,59,SAYID,This is only a prototype. Testing it now may be premature...
0,1,59,KATE,Then it's a good thing I test well.
0,1,60,SAYID,Appears you're as anxious to get off this island as I am.
0,1,64,MICHAEL,"Where you going, man?"
0,1,64,WALT,Nowhere.
0,1,65,WALT (CONT'D),I just thought... I wanted to go see what Mr. Locke's doing.
0,1,65,MICHAEL,"How `bout you help your dad with the wood, okay? I'm sure Mr. Locke doesn't want a kid hanging around him all day, anyway."
0,1,66,WALT,At least he talks to me.
0,1,67,MICHAEL,Okay. Let's talk then. What you wanna talk about?
0,1,67,WALT,Forget it.
0,1,70,CLAIRE,Excuse me. Doctor...?
0,1,70,JACK,"Jack. Claire, right? How's the...?"
0,1,70,CLAIRE,Good. He's good. I think maybe you should see this.
0,1,71,CLAIRE (CONT'D),Somebody found it. In there. They're collecting belongings.
0,1,72,CLAIRE (CONT'D),"They're weeding plans. ""Steve and Kristen's."" They were on the plane. Sitting a couple of rows behind me. I remember `cause... They looked... so happy."
0,1,73,JACK,
0,1,73,CLAIRE,"I thought... Well, some of us were wondering if maybe we should do some kind of... thing. Like a memorial service or something. You could lead it..."
0,1,73,JACK,"Uh, no, I don't think..."
0,1,73,CLAIRE,It's just a few words. Or maybe we could just read off names. From the passports or driver's licenses--
0,1,74,JACK,Look -- It's not my thing.
0,1,75,CLAIRE,Oh. Okay. Then... maybe I could do it.
0,1,75,JACK,Yeah. Sounds fine. Whatever everybody wants.
0,1,78,BOONE,Hi.
0,1,82,BOONE,That woman's still sitting out there.
0,1,82,SHANNON,Uh huh.
0,1,82,BOONE,Her husband was on the plane. In the back.
0,1,82,SHANNON,Great.
0,1,82,BOONE,Are you even listening to me?
0,1,82,SHANNON,"What's a four-letter word for ""I don't care?"""
0,1,82,BOONE,"She hasn't moved from that spot since yesterday, Shannon. Somebody should go talk to her."
0,1,82,SHANNON,"I nominate you. Taking care of the whole freakin' world, one person at a time."
0,1,82,BOONE SHANNON,Not the whole world. Just my -- Who was doing just fine sister-- until you came along.
0,1,82,BOONE,"Yeah! You had it all together. That's why I had to fly seven thousand miles to rescue your ass. Face it, Shannon. You'd be lost without me."
0,1,82,SHANNON,Correction. I am lost with you.
0,1,83,BOONE,"Yeah, well, at least you know you won't starve with me to take care of you."
0,1,83,SHANNON BOONE,I'm not gonna starve... -- Yeah? What're you gonna eat?
0,1,83,SHANNON,Ocean's full of fish.
0,1,83,BOONE,"Hate to break it to you, but the ocean's not gonna take your gold card. And now Shannon finally puts down her magazine. It's ON --"
0,1,83,SHANNON,You don't think I can catch a fish?
0,1,85,HURLEY SAWYER,"-- hand `em over -- There's -- How `bout `no' -- other people here, or don't Well, maybe if one of us you give a crap -- didn't eat more than his fair That's bull and you know it -- share, wouldn't be a shortage Dude, what's your Problem?! -- Hey, I'm peachy, pork-pie. Not happy unless you're You're the one-- screwing over--"
0,1,86,BOONE,"Okay, guys, knock it off. C'mon --"
0,1,86,SAWYER,"Stay outta this, Metro--"
0,1,86,JACK (O.S.),What's going on?
0,1,87,HURLEY,Jethro here's hoarding the last bags of peanuts.
0,1,87,SAWYER,It's my own stash. Found `em in there.
0,1,87,JACK,What about the rest of the food?
0,1,87,HURLEY,"There is no rest of the food, dude. It's gone. We kinda... ate it all."
0,1,88,JACK SAYID,"Okay, everybody calm down... -- We can find food. There are plenty of things on this island to sustain us. ON SAWYER, who casually leans against a row of detached airplane seats."
0,1,88,SAWYER,"Oh yeah? And exactly how are we gonna get this... sustenance? THWACK! A good-sized knife suddenly imbeds itself in the empty seat next to Sawyer. He flinches back, startled."
0,1,89,LOCKE,We hunt.
0,1,90,KATE,How'd you get that knife on the plane?
0,1,91,LOCKE,"I checked it. Jack PULLS the knife out of the seat. For a second we think he might keep it... but instead, he offers it to Locke, hilt out. Sizing up this guy for the first time --"
0,1,91,JACK,"Either you've got good aim... Or bad aim, Mr...?"
0,1,91,MICHAEL,Locke. His name's Locke.
0,1,91,JACK,"Okay. So what is it we're hunting, Mr. Locke?"
0,1,92,LOCKE,"We know there are wild boar on the island. Razorbacks by the look of them. The ones who came into camp last night were piglets... A hundred, hundred and fifty pounds each. That means there's a mother nearby. A two-hundred and fifty pound rat with scimitar-like tusks and a surly disposition, who'd love nothing more than to eviscerate anything that comes near her..."
0,1,93,LOCKE (CONT'D),"... Boars' usual mode of attack are to circle around their prey, charge from behind. So I figure it'll take at least three of us to flank one of the piglets, distract it just long enough for me to pin it... and slit its throat. Everyone stares at him, stunned for a moment. Then Sawyer turns to Jack --"
0,1,93,SAWYER,And you gave him his knife back.
0,1,93,JACK,If you've got a better idea...
0,1,93,SAWYER,Better than three of y'all wandering into the magic forest to bag us a hunk `o ham armed with one l'il bitty knife? Hell no! That's the best idea I ever heard!
0,1,96,HURLEY,Who is this guy?
0,1,97,LOCKE,Yes?
0,1,97,CLIPPED VOICE (V.O.),"Col. Locke, is this line secure?"
0,1,98,LOCKE,"Line secure, GL-12. Go ahead."
0,1,98,CLIPPED VOICE (V.O.),Target area is acquired. Maneuvers are a go for thirteen hundred hours. Repeat -- we are a go.
0,1,98,LOCKE,Roger that. We'll convene at the usual rendezvous point at --
0,1,98,RANDY (O.S.),Locke!
0,1,101,RANDY (CONT'D),I told you. I need those TPS reports finished by noon today. Not twelve-thirty. Not twelve- fifteen. Noon!
0,1,102,LOCKE,"I heard you the first time, Randy."
0,1,103,RANDY,And no personal calls during office hours. Colonel.
0,1,106,JACK (O.S.),"So you're hunting boars now, huh?"
0,1,107,KATE,Who says this is my first time boar- hunting.
0,1,107,JACK,"Uh huh. Tell me something -- How come anytime there's a hike into the Heart of Darkness, you sign up? You know what's in there."
0,1,107,KATE,"Actually, I don't."
0,1,108,KATE (CONT'D),"But at least I've got some experience, right?"
0,1,110,JACK,What's your feel on our new friend?
0,1,110,KATE,Seems to know what he's doing.
0,1,110,JACK,"Call me paranoid, but anyone who packs a suitcase full of knives..."
0,1,110,KATE,"If I didn't know better, I'd say you were worried about me, Jack."
0,1,111,JACK,"If I didn't know better, I'd say you've got a problem staying in one place very long, Kate. So you wanna tell me why you're really going?"
0,1,112,KATE,Sayid gave me this so he can triangulate the distress signal we heard -- Find the source.
0,1,112,JACK,This isn't about boars.
0,1,113,KATE,What can I say? I'm a vegetarian.
0,1,115,WALT,But why can't I come?
0,1,115,MICHAEL,Because I said so --
0,1,116,MICHAEL (CONT'D),"Uh, hi. I'm, uh, Michael. Mi- chael. My name."
0,1,116,SUN,Sun.
0,1,117,MICHAEL,"""Sun."" Sun... That's-- that's nice. Uh, listen, Sun... I'm... I... am going off... off... away... to hunt... And I was wondering... if you... you could keep an eye on my boy... Walt... Y'know... Watch him for me... Until I get back..."
0,1,118,SUN,I will gladly look after your son.
0,1,118,MICHAEL,"Sorry... I don't understand Japanese, but -- You're cool with this, right?"
0,1,118,SUN,Yes. And I'm Korean.
0,1,118,WALT,I don't need a baby-sitter...
0,1,118,MICHAEL,"C'mon, man. Vincent needs you here, okay?"
0,1,119,MICHAEL (CONT'D),And cheer up. This'll give me a chance to get to know your friend Mr. Locke a little better.
0,1,120,SUN,Try not to worry about your father. He will be all right.
0,1,120,WALT,"Yeah, whatever."
0,1,123,SHANNON,Hi.
0,1,123,CHARLIE,"Uh, hello. Shannon, right?"
0,1,123,SHANNON,Yeah. You doing anything right now?
0,1,123,CHARLIE,"Oh, um... N-no, not really. At the, uh..."
0,1,124,CHARLIE (CONT'D),What are you doing now?
0,1,124,SHANNON,I was just gonna take a walk. Wanna come?
0,1,124,CHARLIE,Er. Yeah. Sure.
0,1,125,SHANNON,Can I ask you something?
0,1,125,CHARLIE,I was wondering when you were gonna get `round to it. Yes. I'm the bass player from Drive Sha--
0,1,125,SHANNON,Do you know anything about fishing?
0,1,125,CHARLIE,What--?
0,1,126,CHARLIE (CONT'D),"Fishing? Oh, yeah... My granddad used to take me, taught me everything he knows... knew -- He's dead god rest his soul -- Anyway, I'm, like, a... fishing fiend. England's an island after all, in'it?"
0,1,129,BOONE,Doc? Got a sec?
0,1,129,JACK,Just call me Jack... What's up?
0,1,131,BOONE,"Woman's been sitting by herself. I don't think she's had any food or water. Guess she's having trouble dealing... Y'know, about her husband. Think maybe you could go and talk to her or something?"
0,1,131,JACK,Why me? I'm not a psychiatrist. Maybe you should...
0,1,131,BOONE,"I just figured you might want to `cause, well... You're the one who saved her life."
0,1,134,KATE,Find something?
0,1,135,LOCKE,"Ground here's been rooted up. That's how boars get the majority of their food. Digging. Afterwards, they generally wallow in the dirt, rub up against trees -- --Scoring them with their tusks."
0,1,135,MICHAEL,O-kay. So what's all that mean?
0,1,135,LOCKE,Means we're close.
0,1,136,KATE,"Mr. Locke, how is it you-- Sorry... You have a first name?"
0,1,136,LOCKE,It's John.
0,1,136,KATE,John Locke. Like the philosopher.
0,1,137,LOCKE,Like the philosopher.
0,1,137,KATE,"""Good and evil, reward and punishment, are the only motives to a rational creature..."""
0,1,138,KATE (CONT'D),Minored in college.
0,1,138,MICHAEL,Great. And I got an art degree. Who says higher education doesn't prepare you for the real world?
0,1,138,KATE,"And where'd you learn all this stuff, John? Tracking, hunting..."
0,1,139,LOCKE,"Well, let's just say I've had time to minor in a few things myself."
0,1,140,MICHAEL,Huh. International Man of Mystery.
0,1,142,JACK,"Hi. Rose, right? Remember me? Seat 23A?"
0,1,143,JACK (CONT'D),I'm the guy that told you not to worry about the turbulence.
0,1,144,JACK (CONT'D),"Everybody's getting kinda worried about you. If you want to be alone, that's fine, but you need to take care of yourself. You really should drink. Okay... We don't have to talk. Let's just sit. For a while."
0,1,146,KATE,Your son -- How's he handling all this?
0,1,146,MICHAEL,Hell of a lot better than I am.
0,1,146,KATE,You must be proud. He's a brave kid.
0,1,146,MICHAEL,"Yeah. Can't take credit for that -- I wasn't part of his life, `til his mother passed away. Two weeks ago."
0,1,146,KATE,"Oh, I'm sorry -- I didn't--"
0,1,146,MICHAEL,"That's okay. They were living in Sydney the past couple of years. I flew out last week. To, y'know... get him. What were you doing in Australia?"
0,1,147,LOCKE (O.S.),Shhhhh...
0,1,151,MICHAEL,Quit giving us the steal sign. Damn pig doesn't even know we're--
0,1,159,WARREN (PRE-LAP),Move...
0,1,160,WARREN,"You've got to move, Colonel... Your troops are across enemy lines. And time's running out."
0,1,161,LOCKE,"Patience -- a quality you lack, GL- 12 -- is the hallmark of a leader."
0,1,161,RANDY (O.S.),Really...?
0,1,163,RANDY (CONT'D),"Hallmark, huh? Tell me more about being a leader, Locke."
0,1,164,RANDY (CONT'D),"And while you're at it, explain the deal with this ""Colonel"" thing? Perused your file in Human Resources... You've never been in any armed forces."
0,1,164,WARREN,"Uh, hey, John... Ya wanna move? I gotta get back to the mailroom--"
0,1,164,RANDY,"Shut up, Goldberg. So where'd you serve, Colonel?"
0,1,165,LOCKE,"I'm just playing a game, Randy. This is my lunch hour and I can..."
0,1,165,RANDY,"What's a ""Walkabout?"""
0,1,166,RANDY (CONT'D),"""Experience the dream journeys of the Aborigines as you tour the fabled Australian outback..."
0,1,167,LOCKE RANDY,"You've no right taking that off my-- -- So you wander around, hunting and gathering food, right? On foot?"
0,1,167,LOCKE,"Not that you'd understand... but a Walkabout is a journey of spiritual renewal... where one derives strength from the land... Becomes inseparable from it. I have vacation days, Randy. I'm going. Already made a reservation."
0,1,168,WARREN,"Wow, John, you're really doing it, huh? You tell Helen yet?"
0,1,169,RANDY,"Helen? What's this? Locke, you actually got a woman in your life?"
0,1,169,LOCKE,That's none of your business.
0,1,169,RANDY,"What is it with you, Locke? Why do you torture yourself, imagining you're some globe-trotting spy or hunter... Collecting your brochures for wilderness trips, rafting down the Amazon... and Walkabouts? Wake up -- You can't do any of that!"
0,1,169,LOCKE RANDY,Norman Croucher. -- Norman who?
0,1,169,LOCKE,Norman Croucher. He's a double amputee. No legs. And he climbed to the top of Mount Everest. Why?
0,1,171,RANDY,"That what you think, old man? You have a destiny?"
0,1,171,LOCKE,"Everyone has a destiny, Randy. Mine just hasn't been revealed to me yet. While yours is to grow soft and fat, working in this office, pushing your papers and reports... Always clamoring for promotions that'll never come."
0,1,172,RANDY,"Watch yourself, Locke. Unless you wanna find yourself out of a job."
0,1,173,RANDY (CONT'D),Destiny.
0,1,174,LOCKE,Just... Don't tell me what I can't do.
0,1,176,MICHAEL,How bad is it?
0,1,177,KATE,Uh -- it's... bad.
0,1,178,KATE (CONT'D),John...? You all right?
0,1,178,LOCKE,"Fine. I'm fine, Helen."
0,1,179,LOCKE (CONT'D) KATE,Just-- Just got the wind -- Helen...? knocked out of me -- What? -- You called me Helen.
0,1,180,LOCKE (CONT'D),Did I? Which way did the boar go?
0,1,180,KATE,We've got to get Michael's hurt. him back to...
0,1,180,LOCKE,"Yeah, of course. You take him back to camp. I'll get the boar."
0,1,180,KATE,What -- What are you talking about?
0,1,180,LOCKE,I'm fine. I can do it.
0,1,181,KATE,John -- You can't! LOCKE!!!
0,1,183,LOCKE,Don't tell me what I can't do...
0,1,187,CHARLIE,Ya get it?
0,1,187,HURLEY,Dude -- Quit asking me that. No!
0,1,187,CHARLIE,Sorry. You said you knew how to catch fish.
0,1,187,HURLEY,Yeah. -- Off the Santa Monica Pier with my old man and a fishing pole and bait. Never had to poke one with a sharp stick before.
0,1,187,CHARLIE,"Well, anyway... Really appreciate your help."
0,1,187,HURLEY,"Hey, anything that keeps me far away from that fuselage... And that freakin' redneck jerk."
0,1,188,HURLEY (CONT'D),"Ah, dammit -- crap -- Son of a --"
0,1,188,CHARLIE,Er -- Maybe I can give it a go.
0,1,189,HURLEY,Knock yourself out.
0,1,190,HURLEY (CONT'D),"Okay, here comes one. Remember to put your weight into it... He's heading your way... Easy... Wait for it... Wait... NOW!"
0,1,191,HURLEY (CONT'D) CHARLIE,"Aw, dude -- You were supposed You told me to put my weight to try to pin it against-- into it--"
0,1,195,HURLEY (CONT'D),"Uh, hey, careful, man. You're gonna scare away all the --"
0,1,199,CLAIRE,Um... Is your name Sayid?
0,1,199,SAYID,Yes.
0,1,200,CLAIRE,This has your name on it.
0,1,201,SAYID,
0,1,206,JACK,"You a religious woman, Rose? I didn't get much religion growing up. Just wasn't an issue in my family. Kinda wishing it had been, y'know. After you've been in a plane crash... Helps to believe in... Something."
0,1,207,ROSE,His fingers swell.
0,1,208,JACK,Sorry?
0,1,208,ROSE,Bernard. My husband. His hands swell up when we fly...
0,1,209,JACK,The altitude --
0,1,209,ROSE,"He started having me hold onto his wedding ring whenever we took a plane trip. Always wore it around my neck for safe keeping. Just until we landed, you see..."
0,1,210,ROSE (CONT'D),"Y'know, Doctor, you don't need to keep your promise."
0,1,210,JACK,Promise?
0,1,210,ROSE,The one you made to me on the plane. To keep me company until my husband got back from the restroom. I'm letting you off the hook.
0,1,210,JACK,Sorry. You're not getting rid of me that easily.
0,1,211,JACK (CONT'D),Rose... You shouldn't be out here alone. You're suffering from a post-traumatic shock...
0,1,211,ROSE,Aren't we all?
0,1,212,JACK,Yeah. I guess we are.
0,1,213,ROSE,You've got a nice way about you. A good soul. Patient. Caring... I suppose that's why you became a doctor.
0,1,214,JACK,"Thanks, but I was just kind of born into it... Family business."
0,1,215,JACK (CONT'D),"Do you have a family, Rose? Kids, I mean... You and Bernard?"
0,1,215,ROSE,Mm-hm. Three. All boys.
0,1,215,JACK,Three. That's great. And I'm sure it's important for you to get back to them. They need their mom.
0,1,215,ROSE,"I appreciate the thought, Doctor. But my boys are all grown. Kids get to a certain age, you need them more than they need you."
0,1,216,JACK,I don't know about that.
0,1,217,LOCKE (PRE-LAP),I've never felt so alive...
0,1,219,LOCKE (INTO PHONE),Getting to finally tell Randy off -- It was... life-changing.
0,1,220,LOCKE (INTO PHONE) (CONT'D),"I mean it -- Now I'm free to do all the things I've ever wanted to do. Things I know I was destined to do. Like we talked about, Helen..."
0,1,221,HELEN (V.O.),"It's... wonderful, John. I'm happy for you. Really."
0,1,221,LOCKE (INTO PHONE),I haven't even told you the best part. Remember that Authentic Aboriginal Walkabout --
0,1,221,HELEN (V.O.),Sure. It's all you've talked about for weeks.
0,1,221,LOCKE (INTO PHONE),"Yeah, well... I'm really going to do it. I'm flying to Australia at the end of the week. I bought... two tickets."
0,1,222,LOCKE (INTO PHONE) (CONT'D),-- Eight months.
0,1,222,HELEN (V.O.),I'm not allowed to meet customers.
0,1,222,LOCKE (INTO PHONE),Customer? Is that what I am to--
0,1,222,HELEN (V.O.),"This isn't really normal... I mean, it isn't what I do. Maybe you should find a... I dunno... therapist."
0,1,222,LOCKE (INTO PHONE),I have a therapist.
0,1,222,HELEN (V.O.),John--
0,1,222,LOCKE (INTO PHONE),"I thought you understood, Helen. You know me better than anyone."
0,1,222,HELEN (V.O.),"John, if we talk any longer I'm gonna have to charge you for another hour. That's another $89.95. You can't afford that any--"
0,1,222,LOCKE (INTO PHONE),I don't care about money! I just--
0,1,222,HELEN (V.O.),"I'm sorry, John. I gotta go."
0,1,223,LOCKE (INTO PHONE),Helen?! HELEN!!
0,1,227,KATE,Wait a minute...
0,1,227,MICHAEL,That the guy with the gimpy leg should be deciding when we rest.
0,1,228,MICHAEL (CONT'D),What're you doing?
0,1,228,KATE,Trying to boost the transceiver signal. I'm gonna climb this tree and attach an antenna.
0,1,230,MICHAEL,You're gonna climb that?
0,1,230,KATE,Climbed a lot worse.
0,1,233,MICHAEL,"Aw, hell."
0,1,237,MICHAEL (CONT'D),Hey!!
0,1,238,MICHAEL (CONT'D),You hear that?
0,1,238,KATE,It's on the move.
0,1,238,MICHAEL,What -- Toward us?
0,1,238,KATE,No. It's going that way. Toward...
0,1,239,MICHAEL,What's wrong?
0,1,240,KATE,I think it's heading for Locke.
0,1,251,SAWYER,"These were, uh... Found these the other day. When I was... Ah, hell. Just take `em."
0,1,251,CLAIRE,Thanks.
0,1,251,SAWYER,Yeah.
0,1,254,WALT,What... What is that? That!
0,1,255,WALT (CONT'D),"Ohh. I get it. Like toothpaste, right?"
0,1,256,SUN,Toothpaste.
0,1,256,WALT,Toothpaste.
0,1,257,SUN,Smart boy.
0,1,260,WALT,Dad!
0,1,262,KATE,Watch his leg.
0,1,262,HURLEY,"So, like, what happened out there?"
0,1,263,WALT,Dad! Your leg's all messed up. Does it hurt?
0,1,264,MICHAEL,"S'okay, man. Not as bad as it looks."
0,1,265,SAWYER,"The mighty huntress returns. -- What's for dinner, honey?"
0,1,265,KATE,Not now.
0,1,267,WALT,"Wow... So, like a boar fight --"
0,1,267,MICHAEL,Wasn't so much a fight. Pretty much just me getting gored.
0,1,268,WALT,Um... Where's Mr. Locke?
0,1,272,JACK,Rose... After the sun goes down... We're burning the fuselage...
0,1,273,JACK (CONT'D),It's... It's just something we have to do. There's gonna be a memorial service back at the camp. For those who... who didn't make it. A way for everyone to say good-bye.
0,1,274,ROSE,I'd like to be there for that.
0,1,275,JACK,Okay.
0,1,276,JACK (CONT'D),"Maybe... if you'd like to say something... Y'know, about your husband... To say goodbye to him, I'm sure--"
0,1,276,ROSE,What?
0,1,276,JACK,I'm just saying... If you want to say goodbye to Bernard--
0,1,277,ROSE,Doctor -- My husband's not dead.
0,1,278,JACK,"He was in the tail section, Rose. It broke off in mid-flight. I'm sorry, but... Everyone in the rear of the plane's gone."
0,1,278,ROSE,They're probably thinking the same thing about us.
0,1,281,ROSE (O.S.) (CONT'D),Doctor...?
0,1,282,ROSE (CONT'D),Are you coming?
0,1,285,BOONE,Looks like the hunt didn't go well. That bald guy never came back--
0,1,285,SHANNON BOONE,Wait -- So they didn't bring back any food at all? -- Did you hear what I said?! Somebody may have died out there--
0,1,285,SHANNON,We're all gonna be dead if somebody doesn't--
0,1,285,CHARLIE (O.S.),"Here we are, luv..."
0,1,286,CHARLIE (CONT'D),"As promised, you and me'll be dining on fresh catch of the day. Hope you don't mind alfresco."
0,1,286,SHANNON,My fish!
0,1,287,CHARLIE,"Yeah. Nothin' to it, was there? Like I said... I'm a fishing fiend. This one gave me a hell of a tussle. But I stuck with it... Y'know, tired him out--"
0,1,287,BOONE,I don't believe you --
0,1,287,SHANNON,"Awww, what's the matter? Can't stand me fending for myself?"
0,1,287,BOONE,"Listen, hey, I'm sorry about this--"
0,1,287,CHARLIE,"Uh, no worries, mate. We were-- I mean, I was just--"
0,1,287,SHANNON BOONE,"What are you apologizing to -- For you -- Using this poor him for? guy, just like you use -- Oh, whatever. everybody else --"
0,1,287,BOONE,"And, somehow, in your twisted little brain, you think this proves to me you can take care of yourself."
0,1,288,SHANNON,"Told you I could catch a fish, didn't I?"
0,1,289,BOONE (O.S.),"That's low, Shannon. Even for you."
0,1,289,SHANNON (O.S.),"Oh, go find a baby bird you can rescue or something..."
0,1,290,KATE,I'm sorry. I should've gotten the warrantee.
0,1,290,SAYID,"I suppose I'll just try again. Of course, I have no welding iron, no rivets, scorched wiring... and of course, I must continue to lie to anyone who asks me what I'm actually doing..."
0,1,290,KATE,Sayid --
0,1,291,SAYID,Sorry. I'm cranky when I'm hungry.
0,1,291,KATE,We'll try it again.
0,1,291,SAYID,We'll try it again.
0,1,292,KATE,Really think it'll work?
0,1,292,SAYID,I will make it work.
0,1,292,JACK (O.S.),Kate --
0,1,293,KATE,Hey --
0,1,293,SAYID,Excuse me...
0,1,294,JACK,You okay?
0,1,295,KATE,"Is this where you say ""I told you so?"""
0,1,295,JACK,I'm not big on rubbing it in.
0,1,296,KATE,Locke's gone. That... thing... in there. I think it got him.
0,1,297,KATE (CONT'D),What's going on?
0,1,297,JACK,"The fuselage is ready to go. Some of the others decided to... I guess some words are gonna be said... over the fire... Names read, I think..."
0,1,297,KATE,That's good. A little closure.
0,1,297,JACK,Yeah.
0,1,297,KATE,I don't think they're ready to know what we --
0,1,299,KATE (CONT'D),What?
0,1,302,KATE (CONT'D),Jack --
0,1,305,JACK,Locke -- ?
0,1,309,CLAIRE,"Judith Martha Walker... Denton, Texas... Guess she was gonna catch a connecting flight... Uh, well, she wore corrective lenses. And... she was an organ donor..."
0,1,310,CLAIRE (CONT'D),Or would've been...
0,1,311,CLAIRE (CONT'D),"Oh... yeah. Steve and Kristen. I don't know their last names, but... They were in love... And they were going to be married-- At least... At least wherever they are now... they have each other... They're not alone..."
0,1,316,CLAIRE (CONT'D),"...Manuel Raphael Ortiz... Los Angeles... He turned thirty-two... wow, just last week... And, well, looks like Diego didn't travel much -- At least as far as we can tell from his passport... ... But, oh, he must've had children... A video store receipt in his wallet lists overdue charges... Willy Wonka and... The Little Princess..."
0,1,317,KATE,Have you seen Jack?
0,1,318,CLAIRE (O.S.),So... I guess... I expect they're missing their daddy right now...
0,1,322,MICHAEL,Nice work.
0,1,322,LOCKE,What?
0,1,322,MICHAEL,The boar. Nice work. Y'know... Killing it. Just thought I should say something.
0,1,323,MICHAEL (CONT'D),"So, that... Thing... The monster, whatever... She said it was heading right toward you..."
0,1,324,MICHAEL (CONT'D),"Did you see it? I mean, did you get any kind of look at it?"
0,1,325,LOCKE,No.
0,1,328,TRAVEL AGENT,-- The Walkabouts we arrange aren't just some stroll through the park... It's trekking over vast stretches of desert -- rafting treacherous waters -- climbing --
0,1,329,LOCKE,You've got no idea who you're talking to. Believe me. I'm well aware of what's involved...
0,1,329,LOC KE (CONT'D),Probably know more than you on the subject--
0,1,329,TRAVEL AGENT,"In any case, it's a trying ordeal for someone in peak physical condition, let alone --"
0,1,329,LOCKE,Look -- I booked this tour a month ago. You've already got my money. Now I demand a place on that bus--
0,1,329,TRAVEL AGENT LOCKE,You misrepresented yourself. -- I never lied.
0,1,329,TRAVEL AGENT,"By omission, Mr. Locke! You neglected to tell us about your condition --"
0,1,329,LOCKE,My condition -- is not an issue! I've lived with it for four years and it's never kept me--
0,1,329,TRAVEL AGENT,"Yes, well, unfortunately, it's an issue to our insurance company."
0,1,330,TRAVEL AGENT (CONT'D),I'm sorry. I can't keep the bus waiting any longer. It isn't fair to the other people--
0,1,330,LOCKE,Don't talk to me about fair! --
0,1,330,TRAVEL AGENT,-- We can put you on a plane back to Sydney on our dime. It's the best we can do--
0,1,331,LOCKE,I don't want to go back to Sydney! I've spent years preparing for this. -- You put me on that bus right now! I can do this!
0,1,331,TRAVEL AGENT,No. You can't.
0,1,332,LOCKE,Don't you walk away from me!
0,1,333,LOCKE (CONT'D),You don't know who you're dealing with. -- Don't ever tell me what I can't do! Ever!...
0,1,344,JACK (O.S.),-- get over here -- gimme a hand --
0,1,346,JACK (CONT'D),You! C'mon... Come over here! Gimme a hand! --
