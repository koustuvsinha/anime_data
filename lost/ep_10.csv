0,10,3,SAYID,A boar. Took you tarp.
0,10,3,SAWYER,It was dark -- but yeah. Pretty sure it was a boar...
0,10,3,SAYID,I thought the boar had vacated this area...
0,10,4,SAWYER,"Well, genius, I think we got some bad info."
0,10,4,SAYID,What was it doing in your tent?
0,10,4,SAWYER,It was staring at me.
0,10,5,SAWYER (CONT'D),Then it came at me. So I hit it. And it took off --
0,10,6,SAWYER (CONT'D),Into the jungle.
0,10,6,SAYID,With your tarp. Perhaps it wanted to go camping.
0,10,7,SAWYER,You enjoying yourself?
0,10,8,SAYID,A bit. Yes.
0,10,9,SAWYER,"Laugh it up, Mohammed -- I get back and find my stuff's gone, I'm coming after you."
0,10,10,SAWYER (O.S.) (CONT'D),Sayid --
0,10,11,SAWYER (CONT'D),What did you hear?
0,10,12,SAWYER (CONT'D),"After you ran into the French Woman, you said you heard something in the jungle..."
0,10,12,SAYID,I was injured and exhausted. My mind was playing tricks on me...
0,10,12,SAWYER,What did you hear?
0,10,12,SAYID,I thought I heard... whispering.
0,10,12,SAWYER,What was it saying?
0,10,12,SAYID,Why? Did you hear something?
0,10,13,SAWYER,Forget it.
0,10,14,SAWYER (CONT'D),I didn't hear anything.
0,10,14,WOMAN (PRE-LAP),What are you afraid of?
0,10,15,SAWYER,"Sweetness, I ain't the one tremblin' here --"
0,10,16,WOMAN,I can help with the investors --
0,10,16,SAWYER,-- we're not talkin' about this --
0,10,17,WOMAN,"Seriously, baby -- look at me -- How much money do you need, exactly?"
0,10,18,VOICE (O.S.),"Okay, this is really awkward..."
0,10,21,HIBBS,"...but if I don't say something now, things are liable to get downright embarrassing."
0,10,22,SAWYER,Hibbs --
0,10,22,HIBBS,Hello Sawyer. Ma'am -- I must apologize. I figured my good friend Sawyer here'd be alone. I just need a few minutes.
0,10,23,SAWYER WOMAN,Listen -- -- what's going on --
0,10,25,SAWYER,Soon as I get rid of him I'll find you and explain everything. I promise.
0,10,27,HIBBS,"Gotta hand it to you, Sawbucks. How you find women that beautiful to work your --"
0,10,28,SAWYER,"Now, if I'm not mistaken, Hibbs --"
0,10,29,SAWYER (CONT'D),I'm fairly certain I said I'd kill you if I ever saw you again.
0,10,29,HIBBS,`s why I'm here... make things right...
0,10,30,HIBBS (CONT'D),`Sides -- we both know you ain't the killin' type...
0,10,31,HIBBS (CONT'D),There -- Figure that makes us even for the Tampa job.
0,10,31,SAWYER,Now Hibbs. What could possibly make us even for the Tampa job...
0,10,31,HIBBS,"Oh, I don't know..."
0,10,33,HIBBS (CONT'D),How `bout the known whereabouts of the man who ruined your life?
0,10,34,HIBBS (CONT'D),I'm gonna make myself a drink. You want one?
0,10,35,HIBBS (CONT'D),"You remember Old Man Parks, right -- ran capper for us on that gig in Atlanta."
0,10,35,SAWYER,What about him?
0,10,35,HIBBS,"We still talk from time to time -- he's been working the wire at an off-track parlor down in Sydney. So last week, one of his regulars gets a little too sauced, starts running his mouth about his glory days as a grifter..."
0,10,36,HIBBS (CONT'D),"This guy -- ""Frank Duckett."" Real hard-luck case -- gambling addict, alcoholic, runs a shrimp truck -- You know what a shrimp truck is?"
0,10,36,SAWYER,A truck that sells shrimp?
0,10,36,HIBBS,"Damnit. It is obvious. I owe Parks a fifty... Back in the day, this guy Duckett used to be quite a hustler... He ran the romance angle -- hook the wife, take the husband for all his money. Used to be pretty good at it, too, from what I hear... Until, sadly, one of his marks in despair took a gun, shot up his wife, and blew his own head off... All in front of their little boy..."
0,10,37,HIBBS (CONT'D),"I paid Tony to pull his jacket -- turns out ""Frank Duckett"" used to be named ""Frank Sawyer..."" The name I believe you appropriated for yourself."
0,10,37,SAWYER,This is him...
0,10,37,HIBBS,That's him.
0,10,39,KATE,Thanks for the loaner.
0,10,40,JACK,Always a pleasure.
0,10,41,KATE,Anyone curious where they came from?
0,10,41,JACK,The others know there was a Marshal on the plane. Guess they assume he was travelling alone. Protecting them from terrorists. Sounded like a good theory to me.
0,10,43,KATE,You get all of the guns back?
0,10,43,JACK,All except one.
0,10,43,KATE JACK,Who...? -- How about I give you three guesses?
0,10,43,KATE,Sawyer.
0,10,44,KATE (CONT'D),I can get it back.
0,10,44,JACK,Really. How you gonna do that?
0,10,44,KATE,I speak his language.
0,10,45,JACK,"We've done this before, Kate. If I remember it right, you made out with him and never even had what you said you could get."
0,10,46,KATE,I only made out with Sawyer because torturing him didn't work.
0,10,47,JACK,Let him keep the gun. It's not worth it.
0,10,47,KATE,Why? You afraid he's gonna shoot me if I ask?
0,10,47,JACK,No. I just don't want you to owe him anything.
0,10,51,CLAIRE (O.S.),Hey.
0,10,52,CHARLIE,Hi.
0,10,53,CHARLIE (CONT'D),How are you feeling?
0,10,53,CLAIRE,Very pregnant.
0,10,54,CLAIRE (CONT'D),"I had... dreams last night. More like memories, actually. You were in them. I... They were nice dreams. Thought I'd see if you wanted to take a walk..."
0,10,55,CHARLIE,Sorry. Can't right now. There's... ...something I have to do.
0,10,55,HURLEY (O.S.),Dude -- not the golf club.
0,10,56,CHARLIE,It was all I could find.
0,10,56,HURLEY,You used the sand wedge? Jack will spaz.
0,10,57,CHARLIE,"Excuse me. We've gotta... I'll see you later, all right?"
0,10,57,CLAIRE,Sure. Yeah. All right.
0,10,59,HURLEY,Bye.
0,10,63,WHISPERED VOICE,I was gonna pay --
0,10,78,KATE,A boar. Did all this.
0,10,79,SAWYER,"Yes. A boar did all this. Last night, it wrecked my tent. Then, this morning, when I was going to get my tent back, it attacked me from behind, and ran off into the jungle. Like a coward."
0,10,80,KATE,A boar wouldn't... attack you for no reason.
0,10,80,SAWYER,"Thank you, boar expert. This one did."
0,10,81,SAWYER (CONT'D),It's harassing me...
0,10,82,KATE,What are you doing?
0,10,83,SAWYER,Gettin' even.
0,10,83,KATE,"Listen to yourself. It's a boar. Let's just... tell Locke, he'll go kill it."
0,10,83,SAWYER,Nope. It's my fight...
0,10,83,KATE,Do you know anything about hunting boar?
0,10,84,KATE (CONT'D),Those things are dangerous.
0,10,84,SAWYER,So am I.
0,10,85,KATE,You're gonna get yourself lost. Or worse...
0,10,85,SAWYER,Since when did you care?
0,10,85,KATE,I don't.
0,10,85,SAWYER,Good. Then if you'll excuse me...
0,10,86,SAWYER (CONT'D),I got some revenge to tend to.
0,10,87,HURLEY,"Dude, I know how this works..."
0,10,88,CHARLIE,Trust me. He's dead.
0,10,89,HURLEY,"We put him in the ground, everything seems cool, then when we're about to leave, his hand pops out of the dirt --"
0,10,90,CHARLIE,"S'pose we'll have to bury him deep, then..."
0,10,91,HURLEY,"Doesn't matter. There's no grave that can hold the undead. No, this ends with you and me running through the jungle, screaming and crying --"
0,10,91,CHARLIE,Hurley --
0,10,91,HURLEY,"-- and then he catches me first, `cause I'm heavy and I get cramps --"
0,10,91,CHARLIE,Hurley --
0,10,92,CHARLIE (CONT'D),"You don't have to do this, y'know. I mean -- I appreciate the help and all, I really do... But I killed Ethan. I can bury him."
0,10,93,HURLEY,Nah. I'm good.
0,10,94,HURLEY (CONT'D),Let's just get it done.
0,10,101,KATE (O.S.),That's a footprint.
0,10,102,KATE (CONT'D),"Based on the weight, distance between strides... I'm pretty sure you've been tracking Boone for the last hour."
0,10,102,SAWYER,Look --
0,10,102,KATE,"Could be Jin, I suppose..."
0,10,102,SAWYER,I'm tickled you've taken such an interest in my affairs -- I really am -- so don't take it personal when I tell you to go --
0,10,102,KATE,I want carte blanche.
0,10,102,SAWYER,What?
0,10,102,KATE,It's pretty simple. You can't track this boar without my help.
0,10,102,SAWYER,Is that right?
0,10,102,KATE,"That's right. Over the last few hours, you've managed to follow the tracks of -- Humans, birds, a rockslide, yourself... everything except a boar, actually. You have no idea what you're doing."
0,10,103,KATE (CONT'D),"So I help you, I want carte blanche."
0,10,103,KAT E (CONT'D),"It means ""blank check."""
0,10,103,SAWYER,I know what it means.
0,10,103,KATE,"Every time I want something from your stash -- medicine, soap, whatever -- I get it. No questions asked."
0,10,104,SAWYER,Carte blanche...
0,10,104,KATE,Take it or leave it.
0,10,105,SAWYER,All right. You got a deal.
0,10,108,LAURENCE (V.O.),"So you're Hibbs' mate, huh?... Worked a few jobs with Hibbs back in the States --"
0,10,110,LAURENCE,-- nice enough fella.
0,10,110,SAWYER,He's a son of a bitch.
0,10,110,LAURENCE,Right. Indeed he is.
0,10,111,LAURENCE (CONT'D),Few disclaimers. First off -- Australia doesn't allow its citizenry to own handguns. You get nicked with that --
0,10,111,SAWYER,I ain't gonna rat you out.
0,10,111,LAURENCE,Secondly -- no refunds. Even for dear friends a' mine such as yourself. You decide you don't need a weapon -- not my bikker.
0,10,111,SAWYER,Won't be a problem.
0,10,111,LAURENCE,"Been doin' this a while... a man buys a compact .357 with hollow point loads -- he ain't lookin' to scare, or steal... he's lookin' to kill."
0,10,112,LAURENCE (CONT'D),"And that's all well and good to talk about in the beautiful Sydney Harbor, but when it comes down to it he may find he doesn't have what it takes to do the job..."
0,10,112,SAWYER,Your sales pitch needs some work.
0,10,112,LAURENCE,"I'm sayin' -- you point a gun at a man, you look him in the eye -- you find out who you are. And if you should find that you're not a killer -- well... There's no refunds."
0,10,113,SAWYER,Won't be a problem.
0,10,114,CLAIRE,"So this is, like, our infirmary?"
0,10,114,JACK,Next best thing.
0,10,114,CLAIRE,"I have a friend back home -- she's really into holistic medicine -- the whole ""hospitals are evil, keep things natural"" bit... She'd love this place."
0,10,114,JACK,Any nausea? Headaches?
0,10,115,JACK (CONT'D),Has the baby been moving at all?
0,10,115,CLAIRE,
0,10,116,JACK,"Well if he's as strong as your heart rate, you're both in great shape... How are you holding up otherwise?"
0,10,117,CLAIRE,Okay.
0,10,117,JACK,Memory coming back?
0,10,117,CLAIRE,"In bits and pieces. Certain people... seem familiar. Like I've met them before in another life. Helps, more I talk about it. Brings things into focus, you know."
0,10,118,CLAIRE (CONT'D),"But... everyone's avoiding me. I think I freak them out. I'm ""the weird amnesia chick."""
0,10,118,JACK,"Nice to meet you ""weird amnesia chick,"" I'm the ""heroic doctor."""
0,10,118,CLAIRE,Is that so?
0,10,118,JACK,Minus the heroic part.
0,10,119,JACK (CONT'D),Give `em time. They're just... confused.
0,10,119,CLAIRE,"Yeah, well... I know how they feel."
0,10,122,SAWYER,What?
0,10,122,KATE,Gonna be dark in half an hour.
0,10,122,SAWYER,Then I guess we got half an hour to catch us a hog.
0,10,123,KATE,Suit yourself. He went that way. I'm making camp while I can still see.
0,10,123,SAWYER,What? You're just gonna let it get away? How're we --
0,10,123,KATE,Boars sleep too.
0,10,130,KATE,Where'd you get that?
0,10,130,SAWYER,Plane.
0,10,130,KATE SAWYER,"Jack was looking for the alcohol cart -- -- Well, it's a good thing I found it instead then, huh?"
0,10,131,KATE,Got anymore of those?
0,10,131,SAWYER,I got more a' everything. But you ain't got carte blanche yet.
0,10,131,KATE,"Is that a ""no?"""
0,10,132,SAWYER,"All right, Sassafrass -- but you wanna drink? You gotta play."
0,10,132,KATE,Play what?
0,10,132,SAWYER,I never.
0,10,132,KATE,What?
0,10,132,SAWYER,
0,10,132,KATE,Am I supposed to know what that is?
0,10,132,SAWYER,A game is what it is. Call it a way to get to know each other better. For example... I know you never went to college.
0,10,132,KATE,And how do you know that?
0,10,132,SAWYER,"If you had, you'd a heard of ""I Never."""
0,10,133,SAWYER (CONT'D),"Simple. You say ""I never..."" and then finish the sentence. If it's something you did, you drink. If it's something you never did, you don't drink."
0,10,134,KATE,That makes absolutely no sense.
0,10,134,SAWYER,Then learn by example. I have never kissed a man. Now you drink. `Cause you've kissed a man.
0,10,135,KATE,What's the object of this game?
0,10,135,SAWYER,What's the object of anything?
0,10,137,SAWYER (CONT'D),Your turn.
0,10,137,KATE,I've never implied I went to college when I really haven't.
0,10,138,SAWYER,I never been to Disneyland.
0,10,139,SAWYER (CONT'D),Aww. That's plain sad.
0,10,139,KATE,I've never worn pink.
0,10,140,SAWYER,The eighties. I never voted Democrat.
0,10,141,KATE,I've never voted.
0,10,142,SAWYER,I never been in love.
0,10,142,KATE,You've never been in love.
0,10,142,SAWYER,"Ain't drinking, am I?"
0,10,143,KATE,I've never had a one-night stand.
0,10,144,SAWYER,I gotta drink for each one?
0,10,144,KATE,Your turn.
0,10,144,SAWYER,I never been married.
0,10,145,KATE,Didn't last long.
0,10,146,KATE (CONT'D),I never blamed a boar for all my problems.
0,10,147,SAWYER,I never cared about getting carte blanche `cause I just wanted to spend some time with the only other person on this island who just don't belong.
0,10,148,KATE,I never carried a letter around for twenty years because I can't get over my baggage.
0,10,149,SAWYER,I never killed a man.
0,10,154,SAWYER (CONT'D),"Well, looks like we got something in common after all."
0,10,155,FEMALE VOICE,"Don't come out. Don't make a sound. ON A GUNSHOT we CUT IN to the FLASHBACK we saw at the beginning of the Teaser: Young Sawyer's under the bed, we hear the quick succession of shots -- bang bang bang bang."
0,10,158,WHISPERED VOICE (O.S.),I was gonna pay...
0,10,159,KATE (O.S.),-- Sawyer --
0,10,160,KATE,Sawyer --
0,10,160,SAWYER,Wh-what --
0,10,161,KATE,You okay? You're shaking...
0,10,161,SAWYER,I'm... fine... It was just a --
0,10,162,SAWYER (CONT'D),I don't believe this...
0,10,162,KATE,Yeah. There's... hoof marks everywhere and most of your stuff looks like it's been... chewed.
0,10,162,SAWYER,Look at this!
0,10,162,KATE,I can't figure out how we didn't wake up --
0,10,162,SAWYER,It ate all our stuff...
0,10,162,KATE,"No, it only destroyed your stuff. My stuff's fine."
0,10,163,SAWYER,"That hog's gonna suffer, I swear to god --"
0,10,165,LOCKE,Mornin'.
0,10,166,LOCKE (CONT'D),What happened to your campsite?
0,10,168,KATE,"So what're you doing all the way out here, John?"
0,10,168,LOCKE,"Looking for salvage from the crash. Tail came off over the water, so we were losing pieces as we came in. I've been back-tracking the course."
0,10,168,KATE,Find anything useful?
0,10,168,LOCKE,The occasional scrap of metal -- -- few bags of coffee. Stumbled across your path about a mile back -- thought I'd say howdy.
0,10,170,SAWYER (CONT'D),It peed on my damn shirt! Took my shirt out of my pack and peed on it. I wore that shirt the day we came here. Only piece of clothing that was mine. And he peed on it.
0,10,170,SAW YER (CONT'D),And you say this ain't personal?
0,10,171,KATE,He's convinced the boar we're after has a vendetta against him.
0,10,171,LOCKE,Uh huh.
0,10,171,SAWYER KATE,That's three! Three times he attacked me... -- Maybe it's got your scent. Doesn't like your cologne...
0,10,171,SAWYER KATE,I don't wear cologne. -- Yes you do.
0,10,171,SAWYER,Yeah. Well... He's got it in for me.
0,10,171,KATE,It's just a boar.
0,10,172,LOCKE,My sister Jeannie died when I was a boy. She fell off the monkey bars. Broke her neck.
0,10,173,LOCKE (CONT'D),"My mother -- well, she blamed herself of course. Thought she should've been watching closer. So she stopped eating. Stopped sleeping. Then she just stopped speaking all together. She'd just sit on the couch and stare off into space. The neighbors started talking -- afraid she might do something to herself, I guess."
0,10,173,LOC KE (CONT'D),"Mmmmm. That's good. Anyway, about six months after Jeannie's funeral, this golden retriever comes padding up our driveway, walks right into our house, sits down on the floor and looks right at my mother there on the couch. And my mother looks back at the dog. And after a minute of this -- them both staring at each other like that... My mother burst into tears."
0,10,174,LOCKE (CONT'D),"Beautiful dog. No tags. No collar. Healthy. And sweet. A little older than a puppy. About six months, we figured. Dog slept in Jeannie's old room on Jeannie's old bed and stayed with us until my mother passed eight years later. Disappeared back to wherever it was she came from in the first place."
0,10,175,KATE,You're saying the dog was your sister?
0,10,175,LOCKE,Well that would be silly.
0,10,176,LOCKE (CONT'D),But my mother thought it was. Thought Jeannie came back to let her know that it was okay. To tell her the accident wasn't her fault. To let her off the hook.
0,10,178,SAWYER,So whose fault was it.
0,10,178,LOCKE,Sorry?
0,10,178,SAWYER,The accident. On the monkey bars.
0,10,178,LOCKE,Oh. I don't know. Wasn't there.
0,10,178,SAWYER,Then who says your sister wanted to let your momma off the hook?
0,10,179,LOCKE,"Well I suppose if she hadn't... Jeannie would've come back as a much meaner dog, wouldn't she?"
0,10,191,DUCKETT (O.S.),Hey -- pal --
0,10,192,DUCKETT (CONT'D),Only two choices -- shrimp in mild sauce and shrimp in hot sauce.
0,10,193,SAWYER,I'll go with the hot...
0,10,193,DUCKETT,Hot it is...
0,10,194,DUCKETT (CONT'D),"Fellow American, huh?... Good for you. You missed the lunch rush."
0,10,195,DUCKETT (CONT'D),Whereabouts you from?
0,10,196,SAWYER,Tennessee...
0,10,197,DUCKETT,Love the South. Miss the southern women.
0,10,198,DUCKETT (CONT'D),You in Australia long?
0,10,198,SAWYER,Not really.
0,10,199,DUCKETT,Well -- fer what it's worth -- I run a special here at the truck -- half off for all Americans.
0,10,200,DUCKETT (CONT'D),"My name's Frank, by the way."
0,10,201,SAWYER,James.
0,10,202,DUCKETT,"Good to meet ya, James."
0,10,204,DUCKETT (CONT'D),Okay -- one shrimp in hot sauce comin' right --
0,10,205,DUCKETT (CONT'D),-- up...
0,10,206,HURLEY (O.S.),Yo Sayid --
0,10,207,HURLEY (CONT'D),Can I ask you a question?
0,10,208,HURLEY (CONT'D),"Did you ever get like, Gulf War Syndrome?"
0,10,208,SAYID,That was the other side.
0,10,208,HURLEY,Oh. Right.
0,10,208,SAYID,Why do you want to know if I've had chemical attack-related illness?
0,10,208,HURLEY,Becau -- That's what Gulf War Syndrome is?
0,10,209,HURLEY (CONT'D),What's the one where you're all... shellshocked?
0,10,209,SAYID,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
0,10,209,HURLEY,That's it. Did you ever have that?
0,10,209,SAYID,Again -- why do you ask?
0,10,209,HURLEY,I'm worried about Charlie...
0,10,209,SAYID,What's wrong with Charlie...
0,10,209,HURLEY,"Well -- nothing. That's just it -- I mean, he killed a man -- shot him four times in the chest -- and he's acting like he's totally fine..."
0,10,211,KATE,"You don't believe him, do you?"
0,10,211,SAWYER,"Man says he's tracking wreckage, he's tracking wreckage."
0,10,211,KATE,"No, I mean, about the boar..."
0,10,211,SAWYER,Let's just say it'll be fun to see what it comes back as in its next life.
0,10,211,KATE,Sawyer -- seriously --
0,10,212,KATE (CONT'D),Sawyer --
0,10,213,KATE (CONT'D),"What are we doing? We're miles from camp. Even if we manage to find it, it weighs what? Eight hundred pounds? There's no way we're going to be able to bring it back."
0,10,213,SAWYER,Who said anything about bringing it back?
0,10,214,SAWYER (CONT'D),We're out here to kill it.
0,10,215,SAWYER,Again.
0,10,216,BARTENDER,"You sure about that, mate?"
0,10,216,SAWYER,Again.
0,10,217,VOICE (O.S.),"You tell him, cowboy. These bastards think Americans can't hold their liquor."
0,10,218,SAWYER,Again.
0,10,219,VOICE (O.S.),Hate to put my hand out -- but I can't seem to find my wallet. Any way you could...?
0,10,219,SAWYER,Set him up.
0,10,220,VOICE (O.S.),"I drink to you. What's your name, cowboy?"
0,10,220,SAWYER,Sawyer.
0,10,221,VOICE (O.S.),To Sawyer. May he find whatever he's looking for at the bottom of a glass.
0,10,225,SHEPHARD,"So, Sawyer -- what brings you to Sydney?"
0,10,225,SAWYER,Business.
0,10,225,SHEPHARD,Three PM on a Tuesday afternoon and you're throwing back bourbon. That's my kind of business.
0,10,225,SAWYER,What brings you to Sydney?
0,10,225,SHEPHARD,"Furthest I could run. Know why they call Australia ""Down Under?"" `Cause it's as close to hell as you can get without getting burned."
0,10,226,SAWYER,"How about you leave the bottle, Slim."
0,10,227,SAWYER (CONT'D),What's your handle -- back in the States?
0,10,227,I...,Was a Chief of Surgery.
0,10,227,SAWYER SHEPHARD,Was? -- Was.
0,10,227,SAWYER,"So we're in hell, huh?"
0,10,227,SHEPHARD,Not in. Just close. Or maybe on our way.
0,10,228,SAWYER,Speak for yourself.
0,10,228,SHEPHARD,"Don't let the air conditioning fool you, son. You're here, too. And you're suffering."
0,10,229,SHEPHARD (CONT'D),Hey -- Don't beat yourself up about it. It's fate. Some people are supposed to suffer. It's why the Red Sox'll never win the damn Series -- They're made to suffer.
0,10,229,SAWYER,I ain't made to do anything.
0,10,229,SHEPHARD,"Okay. Then let me ask you something, Sawyer -- Do you have the means to end it?"
0,10,229,SAWYER SHEPHARD,What the hell are you --?!? -- Your suffering. Do you have the means to put it to rest? Make it go away?
0,10,230,SHEPHARD (CONT'D),"Yeah. Me too. But we don't end it, do we?"
0,10,231,SHEPHARD (CONT'D),"I have a son -- about your age. He's not like me. He keeps it simple, does what's in his heart. A good man. Maybe a great one. Right now, he thinks I hate him. That I feel betrayed by him. But what I really feel? Is gratitude. And pride. Because what he did to me? For me? It took more courage than... There's a payphone over there. I could pick it up, call my son. And I could tell him all this. And I could tell him I love him. One simple phone call and I could fix... everything. I could take away his suffering."
0,10,232,SAWYER,Why don't you?
0,10,233,SHEPHARD,Because I'm weak.
0,10,234,SHEPHARD (CONT'D),You close with your father?
0,10,235,SAWYER,He died when I was a kid.
0,10,236,SHEPHARD,"This ""business"" you've got. Will it ease your suffering?"
0,10,236,SAWYER,Yeah.
0,10,236,SHEPHARD,Then what are you doing here?
0,10,236,SAWYER,It's not that simple.
0,10,236,SHEPHARD,Sure it is. Unless you want to end up like me.
0,10,237,SAWYER,"What's your name, Doc?"
0,10,237,SHEPHARD,Christian.
0,10,238,SAWYER,"Thank you, Christian."
0,10,239,SHEPHARD,"Good luck, Sawyer."
0,10,245,SAYID (O.S.),You're developing quite a talent.
0,10,246,CHARLIE,"Yeah well, you know, musical trends being what they are... who knows what'll be popular when we get back home? Now I've got a skill I can fall back on."
0,10,247,CHARLIE (CONT'D),"Oh, I get it. You're here to check up on me..."
0,10,247,SAYID,You killed a man.
0,10,247,CHARLIE,"A man who killed one of us, who kidnapped Claire -- who strung me up and left me for dead. He deserved to die -- and I'd do it again in a minute..."
0,10,248,CHARLIE (CONT'D),So pardon me if I'm fresh out of bad feelings.
0,10,249,SAYID,"When I was in the army in Tikirt, in Iraq, the man who lived next door was a policeman. One day his car was rigged with a bomb. It went off but it missed him -- it killed his wife and two young children instead. They caught the man who did it. I volunteered to be on the firing squad. And I did my duty without a single ounce of remorse."
0,10,250,SAYID (CONT'D),"Then... for no reason, I started waking up nights. Replaying what I did in my mind."
0,10,250,CHARLIE,Looks like you're the one who needs checking up on.
0,10,250,SAYID,What I'm saying is this: what happened with Ethan will be with you for the rest of your life.
0,10,250,CHARLIE,Meaning an impending lack of sleep?
0,10,250,SAYID,More than that.
0,10,251,CHARLIE,Any suggestions?
0,10,251,SAYID,You're not alone. Don't pretend to be.
0,10,254,SAWYER,I take comfort in knowing... someday this is all gonna be a real nice shoppin' complex or maybe an auto mall...
0,10,255,SAWYER (CONT'D),Where ya goin'?...
0,10,256,KATE,Know what this is?
0,10,256,SAWYER,A hole in the mud?
0,10,256,KATE,A wallow.
0,10,256,SAWYER KATE,"What the hell's a wa-- -- A boar's wallow. It's his den, where he sleeps. And look at the tree rubbings from his tusks."
0,10,256,SAWYER,You mean he's around here?
0,10,256,KATE,Maybe
0,10,257,SAWYER,Hear that?
0,10,258,KATE,Wait --
0,10,259,KATE SAWYER (O.S.),Sawyer?!... Gotcha!
0,10,260,KATE (CONT'D),I thought it'd be bigger.
0,10,260,SAWYER,Funny. Now we know daddy's gotta be close by.
0,10,261,KATE SAWYER,"Stop it Sawyer! What is the matter with you?! Here PIGGY, PIGGY, PIGGY -- ! Stop it! Damn it! Let it go! Over here, daddy!"
0,10,263,SAWYER (CONT'D),
0,10,264,KATE SAWYER,You're SICK! I didn't hurt it!
0,10,265,KATE,We're done. Game over.
0,10,265,SAWYER,What are you talkin' about?! --
0,10,265,KATE,Find your own way back.
0,10,265,SAWYER,No problem.
0,10,269,SAWYER,Sawyer --
0,10,274,SAWYER (CONT'D),I got a letter for you...
0,10,275,SAWYER (CONT'D),"""Dear Mr. Sawyer -- """
0,10,275,DUCKETT,Who --
0,10,276,SAWYER,You used to go by the name Sawyer...
0,10,277,DUCKETT,The hell you talkin' about...
0,10,278,DUCKETT (CONT'D),You didn't have to -- Tell Hibbs I would've...
0,10,279,SAWYER,You know Hibbs? How do you know Hibbs?
0,10,280,DUCKETT,Tell Hibbs I would've paid him...
0,10,280,SAWYER,You borrowed money from Hibbs...
0,10,281,DUCKETT,"You don't know what you're doing, do you... It'll come back around."
0,10,282,DUCKETT (CONT'D),I was gonna pay...
0,10,286,SAWYER,Kate!
0,10,287,SAWYER,"C'mon, Kate! Where are y--?"
0,10,298,SAWYER (CONT'D),It's just a boar. Let's get back to camp.
0,10,300,KATE,...a deal's a deal.
0,10,300,SAWYER,The deal was for toiletries --
0,10,300,KATE,"""Carte blanche."" Whatever I want. And I want the gun."
0,10,301,SAWYER,I didn't kill the damn hog --
0,10,301,KATE,I said I'd help you find it. We found it.
0,10,302,SAWYER,Jack asked me for the gun two days ago... That why you came on this trek -- to do your doctor boyfriend a favor?
0,10,303,KATE,You needed help. I helped. You don't like the deal? Not my problem.
0,10,308,CHARLIE,Hey.
0,10,309,CLAIRE,Hey.
0,10,309,CHARLIE,Wanna go for that walk?
0,10,310,CLAIRE,Sure.
0,10,312,SAWYER (O.S.),Stick `em up.
0,10,313,JACK,You trying to be funny?
0,10,313,SAWYER,Yeah. But I was fresh out of pies to throw atcha.
0,10,315,SAWYER (CONT'D),"Here ya go, Sheriff."
0,10,315,JACK,I asked you for this two days ago --
0,10,315,SAWYER,-- and I told you to stick it. Guess I had a change of heart.
0,10,316,JACK,What'd she give you?
0,10,317,SAWYER,Sorry?
0,10,317,JACK,Kate. What'd she give you?
0,10,318,SAWYER,Nothin' she wasn't willing to part with.
0,10,320,JACK,That's why the Sox'll never win the series.
0,10,321,SAWYER,What'd you just say?
0,10,322,JACK,Huh?
0,10,322,SAWYER,What'd you just say?
0,10,322,JACK,"I said ""That's why the Red Sox will never win the Series."""
0,10,322,SAWYER,What the hell does --?!?
0,10,322,JACK,"Something my dad used to say. So he could go through life knowing people hated him. Instead of taking responsibility, he put it on fate. Said he was made that way."
0,10,323,SAWYER,"Your daddy -- He a doctor, too?"
0,10,323,JACK,He was. He's dead.
0,10,324,JACK (CONT'D),Why do you want to know about my father?
0,10,326,SAWYER,No reason.
0,10,330,THE END,
