0,2,7,MEATHEAD,Stay down.
0,2,10,MEATHEAD,"Your choice, man -- Walk away now, you won't get your ass kicked."
0,2,14,MEATHEAD,"Shoulda stayed down, Jack."
0,2,15,CHARLIE (O.S.),Jack? Jack! HEY JACK!
0,2,16,CHARLIE,You've gotta -- someone's out there! The current! Someone's --
0,2,17,JACK CHARLIE,What? -- Someone's out there!
0,2,18,CHARLIE (CONT'D),I woke up -- I don't swim and...
0,2,31,JACK,"Deep breaths -- c'mon, man -- relax -- you're okay -- deep breaths..."
0,2,32,BOONE,Did you... get her?
0,2,32,JACK,What?
0,2,32,BOONE,The woman... out there... I was trying to... Did you get her?
0,2,35,BOONE JACK,You have to get her -- -- No -- Current's too strong
0,2,42,KATE,Jack!
0,2,42,JACK,There's someone else out there.
0,2,55,KATE,Hey --
0,2,55,JACK,So what'd they say?
0,2,55,KATE,"Jack, maybe you should..."
0,2,55,JACK,Who was she?
0,2,56,KATE,"Her name was Joanna. She wasn't supposed to be on the plane. She went scuba diving off the Barrier reef and got an ear infection. Doctor grounded her two days, so she bumped her flight. Ended up with us."
0,2,56,JACK,She was swimming this morning. Just swimming. Riptide caught her. We've been here six days and we never talked. I never said a word to her. There were --
0,2,56,KATE JACK,Jack. Don't. -- forty seven of us. I didn't say a single word.
0,2,57,KATE,You tried.
0,2,58,JACK,No. I didn't. I thought maybe I could... I thought I could bring him back and still have time. I was there -- in the water... I didn't try. I decided not to go after her.
0,2,60,KATE,What's...?
0,2,64,KATE (O.S.),Jack?
0,2,64,KATE,Are you okay?
0,2,66,JACK,You see that?
0,2,66,KATE,See what?
0,2,66,JACK,He was just standing there... in the water. A man.
0,2,67,KATE,Jack...
0,2,68,JACK,You didn't see him?
0,2,68,KATE,When's the last time you slept?
0,2,69,JACK,I have to put this with the rest of the gear.
0,2,74,MICHAEL,"Don't swallow it, okay?"
0,2,74,WALT,Why not?
0,2,74,MICHAEL,`Cause it's from the ocean. It'll make you thirsty.
0,2,74,WALT,Why?
0,2,75,MICHAEL,"Just don't swallow it, man."
0,2,81,JIN,You need water.
0,2,81,SUN,No -- I'm all right. Thank you.
0,2,83,SUN,When will someone tell us what to do?
0,2,83,JIN,What?
0,2,83,SUN,I don't think anyone is coming.
0,2,83,JIN,Someone will come.
0,2,84,SUN,The others... they ignore us. If we tried harder to communicate...
0,2,84,JIN,We'll be fine. We don't need them.
0,2,85,JIN,I will tell you what to do.
0,2,89,SHANNON (O.S.),Have you got it or what?
0,2,90,SAWYER,"You're in my light, sticks."
0,2,91,SHANNON,"""Lightsticks?"" What the hell is that supposed to --"
0,2,91,SAWYER,Light. Comma. Sticks. Meaning your legs.
0,2,92,SAWYER,How's your brother?
0,2,92,SHANNON SAWYER,"What do you mean how -- -- Almost drowned, didn't he?"
0,2,92,SHANNON,Look -- while I really love my new nickname and I think it's really sweet that you're asking...
0,2,92,SAWYER,Calm down. I got your damn stuff.
0,2,93,SHANNON,It'll keep off sand fleas?
0,2,93,SAWYER,"You bet. And it's got aloe, too."
0,2,93,SHANNON,How much?
0,2,93,SAWYER SHANNON,"You serious? -- Yeah, I'm..."
0,2,94,SAWYER,"You in the same situation I am? `Cause last I checked, we weren't going nowhere for awhile. Your money's no good here."
0,2,94,SHANNON,So what the hell do you want? If you think that I'm...
0,2,94,SAWYER,Five grand.
0,2,95,SHANNON,I thought you said money was no good here.
0,2,95,SAWYER,I was negotiating. I'll take an IOU. Somethin' tells me you're good for it.
0,2,96,SHANNON,Screw you.
0,2,99,CLAIRE (O.S.),You haven't found a hairbrush have you?
0,2,100,KATE,Nope. Sorry.
0,2,100,CLAIRE,I must've looked in twenty suitcases today and I can't find one. Weird. You'd think everyone packs a --
0,2,101,KATE,Whoa -- You okay?
0,2,102,CLAIRE,Yeah it's just the heat. Oh. And I'm pregnant.
0,2,102,KATE,Really?
0,2,103,CLAIRE,Thanks.
0,2,103,KATE,"Wanna sit? You can help me sort the ""practical clothes"" from the ""impractical clothes."""
0,2,103,CLAIRE,How can you tell the difference?
0,2,103,KATE,Practical. Impractical.
0,2,103,CLAIRE,"Can I ask you something? Don't mean to get personal, but I'm curious."
0,2,103,KATE,Sure. Shoot.
0,2,103,CLAIRE,Are you a Gemini?
0,2,103,KATE,Yeah.
0,2,103,CLAIRE,"Thought so. Restless. Passionate. Everyone thinks Astrology is a load of crap, but that's because they don't understand it. I could do your chart if you'd like... Ah. All right then. Geminis."
0,2,106,HURLEY (O.S.),"Hey, Jack?"
0,2,107,HURLEY,"Whoa -- You look tired, brother."
0,2,107,JACK,I'm fine. What's up?
0,2,107,HURLEY,"We've got a problem, man."
0,2,108,JACK,That's it?
0,2,108,CHARLIE (O.S.),That's it.
0,2,111,JACK,How many?
0,2,111,CHARLIE,Eighteen.
0,2,111,HURLEY,"People just took what they needed `cause, y'know we were supposed to be rescued? But uh -- we weren't. And it hasn't rained, man."
0,2,111,CHARLIE,"Even if we divvied it up... split the bottles in half, it wouldn't be enough water for all forty-seven..."
0,2,111,JACK,Forty-six. There's forty-six now.
0,2,112,HURLEY,"It's getting pretty toasty out here. When people find out this is it, they're gonna freak out, man."
0,2,112,CHARLIE,And the boar's running low until we can catch another one. What should we tell them?
0,2,113,JACK,I don't know.
0,2,113,HURLEY CHARLIE,Maybe we can make one of those water-finding sticks... -- Where should we put what we've got?
0,2,113,JACK,I don't know...
0,2,115,CHARLIE HURLEY,"We should put it in the tent, yeah? -- Maybe that dog can find"
0,2,116,CHARLIE HURLEY,"Probably better if no one knows how little is left... -- Dogs can find pot and bombs, so they can find water..."
0,2,117,CHARLIE,"If you tell the others we're running low, we can ration it. That way you can decide who gets..."
0,2,118,JACK,I'm not deciding anything.
0,2,119,HURLEY,Why not?
0,2,127,SHEPHARD,"Not the best decision, huh kiddo?"
0,2,128,SHEPHARD,You wanna come in?
0,2,129,SHEPHARD,So how's the other guy look?
0,2,130,SHEPHARD (CONT'D),Want to tell me what happened?
0,2,130,JACK,Couple guys jumped Marc Silverman.
0,2,130,SHEPHARD,Couple guys jumped Marc Silverman. But they didn't jump you.
0,2,130,JACK,No.
0,2,132,SHEPHARD,"Okay, Jack. One's got a quarter in it. Other's empty. You choose right, quarter's yours. You choose wrong, you give me a quarter."
0,2,133,SHEPHARD (CONT'D),"Decide, Jack."
0,2,135,SHEPHARD (CONT'D),Pay up.
0,2,137,SHEPHARD (CONT'D),"Your heart's in the right place. Sticking up for the little guy. But look what happened. You made the wrong call. You lost, buddy. You failed."
0,2,138,SHEPHARD (CONT'D),"Boy was on my table today. Year younger than you, maybe. Bad heart. And it was a real rough one, Jack. Got real hairy, real fast. People were looking to me to make decisions. Big decisions. What to do. How to do it. And I was able to make those decisions because at the end of the day after that boy died, I was able to wash my hands, come home to dinner, watch Carol Burnett and laugh until my sides hurt. And how can I do that? Even when I fail -- How do I do that? Because I have what it takes."
0,2,139,SHEPHARD,"Don't choose, Jack. Don't decide. Walk away from the fights. Because when you fail -- when you make the wrong choice? It's gonna hurt. And buddy? When that hurt comes? You don't have what it takes."
0,2,142,SHEPHARD (CONT'D),Same rules. Double or nothing. Decide.
0,2,143,SHEPHARD (CONT'D),Good boy.
0,2,143,UNBLINKING.,Those same intense eyes.
0,2,146,BOONE (O.S.),Why didn't you leave me?
0,2,148,JACK,"Not now, man."
0,2,148,BOONE,"I could have made it back. What? You're not gonna answer me? I told you to leave me, man. I told you I could've..."
0,2,148,JACK,You were drowning.
0,2,149,BOONE,You should've saved her.
0,2,150,JACK,But I didn't save her. And neither did you.
0,2,151,BOONE,"You think you're all noble and heroic coming after me? I was fine. You're not the only one around here who knows what to do, man. I run a business. Who appointed you savior? What gives you the right to..."
0,2,157,BOONE,Hey -- Don't you walk away from me. Where the hell are you going? HEY!
0,2,177,JACK,Gone... he's gone... he's gone...
0,2,178,MARGO (O.S.),"He's gone, Jack."
0,2,179,JACK,He'll be back.
0,2,181,MARGO,This time it's different.
0,2,183,MARGO,Please don't touch that.
0,2,183,JACK,Ever notice there aren't any pictures of me in here? Or you?
0,2,183,MARGO,It's his study.
0,2,183,JACK,Yeah.
0,2,184,MARGO,I want you to bring him back.
0,2,184,JACK MARGO,That's good. Yeah. Me. -- What?
0,2,184,JACK,"He hasn't talked to me in two months, man."
0,2,184,MARGO JACK,"You haven't talk to him in two months. -- He doesn't want me to bring him back. Trust me. Let one of his ""friends""..."
0,2,184,MARGO,He doesn't have friends anymore. Why do you think that is?
0,2,186,MARGO,He was right about you.
0,2,187,JACK,Right about what?
0,2,187,MARGO,You don't understand the pressure he was under. You --
0,2,187,JACK,I understand pressure.
0,2,189,MARGO,Please -- You know how he gets. He doesn't... he won't take care of himself. You have to go after him. Please.
0,2,190,JACK,I'm sorry. I can't.
0,2,191,MARGO,
0,2,192,JACK,Where is he?
0,2,193,MARGO,Australia.
0,2,202,KATE,What's wrong?
0,2,202,WALT,That pregnant lady fell down.
0,2,204,KATE CHARLIE,What happened?
0,2,205,KATE MICHAEL,I was with her before -- the heat... Is she breathing? -- Where's the doctor?
0,2,205,KATE,Let's get her inside --
0,2,207,CHARLIE,"She's breathing, I think..."
0,2,208,KATE,Claire? Can you hear me? Claire? Wake up...
0,2,209,CHARLIE,What...?
0,2,209,KATE,"Claire, it's me -- Kate. You passed out. Take it easy okay? She needs water."
0,2,209,CHARLIE,Water. Yeah. There's some right...
0,2,211,CHARLIE,What the...?!?
0,2,211,CHARLIE,The water's gone.
0,2,212,LOCKE,Where's the doctor?
0,2,213,KATE,I don't know. No one can find him.
0,2,213,SAYID,And this was the last of the camp's water supply?
0,2,213,KATE,Yeah.
0,2,213,SAYID,Keeping it all in one place. Foolish.
0,2,213,KATE SAYID,I can go into the jungle. Maybe find some fresh water. -- You're not going alone --
0,2,213,LOCKE,"When the others find out we're out of water, it's gonna get ugly. And when they find out someone pinched it, it's gonna get uglier. I'll go. Camp needs you two here. Especially with the doctor gone. Besides -- I know where to look."
0,2,217,JACK,Where are you?
0,2,218,JACK,Where are you?
0,2,222,HOTEL MANAGER,The maid says he hasn't used the bed in the past three days.
0,2,224,JACK,He rent a car through your concierge?
0,2,224,HOTEL MANAGER,"No, sir."
0,2,226,HOTEL MANAGER,"Quite honestly, Mr. Shephard, I don't think he rented a car at all."
0,2,226,JACK,Yeah? Why's that?
0,2,226,HOTEL MANAGER,There was an incident a few nights ago. Here at the hotel bar. I had to ask Security to escort your father to his room.
0,2,227,JACK,What's that have to do with renting a car?
0,2,227,HOTEL MANAGER,I'm sorry. I shouldn't have...
0,2,227,JACK HOTEL MANAGER,C'mon. What's it have to do
0,2,229,HOTEL MANAGER,I don't think any rental agent in Sydney would lease your father a car in his condition.
0,2,230,JACK,My father... Is a Chief of Surgery.
0,2,231,HOTEL MANAGER,"Of course, sir. I apologize."
0,2,235,JACK,He left his wallet. Who leaves a wallet?
0,2,235,HOTEL MANAGER,"Perhaps you should talk to the police, Mr. Shephard."
0,2,236,JACK,Where are you?
0,2,241,JACK,Wait!
0,2,256,VOICE (O.S.),Take my hand.
0,2,262,LOCKE,You okay?
0,2,266,CHARLIE (O.S.),Hey...
0,2,267,CLAIRE,Hey. How long have I...?
0,2,267,CHARLIE,"Couple hours. Here -- it's not much, but it's what we have."
0,2,268,CLAIRE,I should get up...
0,2,269,CHARLIE,"You just relax, yeah? Got to think about the little one."
0,2,270,CLAIRE,Thanks for the water.
0,2,270,CHARLIE,Yeah. A whole swallow. There'd be more if some git hadn't nicked it.
0,2,270,CLAIRE,Is Jack back yet?
0,2,270,CHARLIE,No. No one's seen him. Don't worry though -- good ole' Mr. Locke's gone into the jungle to get you some water. Should be back before nightfall.
0,2,270,CLAIRE,Great. Our only hunter's gonna get eaten so that he can get the pregnant girl some more water.
0,2,270,CHARLIE,"I wouldn't worry, love. You tell me who'd you rather meet in a dark alley -- whatever's out there, or that geezer and his four hundred knives?"
0,2,271,CHARLIE,"Seriously. Who packs four hundred knives? Personally? I only have room for two hundred. Three hundred, the most."
0,2,272,CLAIRE,When are they going to find us? The rescuers?
0,2,273,CHARLIE,Soon.
0,2,273,CLAIRE,"Thanks, Charlie."
0,2,273,CHARLIE,Thanks for what?
0,2,273,CLAIRE,People don't look me in the eye here. I think I scare them. The baby... I'm like this time bomb of responsibility waiting to go off.
0,2,274,CHARLIE,You don't scare me.
0,2,275,SHANNON,"Hey, Superman -- still moping?"
0,2,276,SHANNON,Boone?
0,2,277,SHANNON,It's not your fault that...
0,2,277,BOONE,"Go away, Shannon."
0,2,278,SHANNON,"Nice talking to you, jackass."
0,2,281,HURLEY,The Chinese people have water.
0,2,282,SAYID,Where did you get this?
0,2,283,SAYID KATE,"Where. Did. You -- -- She doesn't understand you, Sayid..."
0,2,283,SAYID,She understands me. Did you steal this water?
0,2,284,SUN,This is a misunderstanding...
0,2,285,JIN,"Get away from her, pig! If you touch my wife.."
0,2,286,KATE,"Easy. Let's just talk about this, all right?"
0,2,287,KATE,Is this yours?
0,2,288,KATE,Who gave you this?
0,2,291,KATE,Sonofa...
0,2,291,(CON T'D):,"And Kate is set to rip Sawyer's fucking head off, but..."
0,2,292,SAYID,I don't see the water.
0,2,292,KATE,So?
0,2,292,SAYID,"You go after him now, he'll give you nothing. But if you wait... A rat will always lead you to its hole."
0,2,296,JACK,How are they? The others.
0,2,296,LOCKE,They're thirsty. Hungry. Waiting to be rescued. And they need someone to tell them what to do.
0,2,297,JACK,Me? I can't --
0,2,297,LOCKE,Why can't you?
0,2,299,JACK,Because I'm not a leader.
0,2,299,LOCKE,And yet they all treat you like one. Hm.
0,2,300,JACK,"I don't know how to help them. I'll fail, I'll... I don't have what it takes."
0,2,302,LOCKE,"Why are you out here, Jack?"
0,2,302,JACK,I think I'm going crazy.
0,2,302,LOCKE,You're not going crazy.
0,2,302,JACK,No?
0,2,302,LOCKE,"Crazy people don't know they're going crazy. They think they're getting saner. So why are you out here, Jack?"
0,2,303,JACK,I'm chasing something. Someone.
0,2,303,LOCKE,Ah. The White Rabbit. Alice in Wonderland.
0,2,303,JACK,"Yeah, Wonderland. Because who I'm chasing? He's not here."
0,2,303,LOCKE,But you see him.
0,2,303,JACK,Yes. But he's not here.
0,2,303,LOCKE,"And if I came to you saying the same thing, what would your explanation be? As a doctor?"
0,2,303,JACK,I'd call it a hallucination. Result of dehydration. Post Traumatic Stress. Not having slept more than two hours a night for the last week. All of the above.
0,2,303,LOCKE,"All right, then. You're hallucinating. But what if you're not?"
0,2,304,JACK,Then we're all in a lot of trouble.
0,2,305,LOCKE,"I'm an ordinary man, Jack. Meat and potatoes. I live in the real world. Not a big believer in ""magic."""
0,2,306,JACK,That's impossible.
0,2,306,LOCKE,"Even if it is, let's say it's not."
0,2,307,JACK,Then what happens if I catch him?
0,2,307,LOCKE,"I don't know -- But, I've looked into the eye of this island. And what I saw? It was beautiful."
0,2,308,JACK,Wait -- Where are you --?
0,2,308,LOCKE,Someone needs this water back at the beach.
0,2,308,JACK,I'll come with you.
0,2,308,LOCKE,No. You need to finish what you started.
0,2,309,JACK,Why?
0,2,310,LOCKE,Because a leader can't lead until he know's where he's going.
0,2,319,SAWYER,It's about time.
0,2,319,KATE,About time for what?
0,2,319,SAWYER,I made this birthday wish four years ago.
0,2,320,SAYID,Does he have it?
0,2,321,SAWYER KATE,"What? You two follow me out here? I wanna see a warrant! -- Where's the water, you--"
0,2,322,SAWYER,That's better.
0,2,324,SAYID,Give the water to us now.
0,2,324,SAWYER,Touch me again.
0,2,325,SAWYER,You really think I stole your damn water?
0,2,325,SAYID,We know you gave two bottles to the Korean couple...
0,2,326,SAWYER,I don't give nothin' to nobody.
0,2,326,KATE,It's not here.
0,2,326,SAWYER,I traded Mr. Miyagi the last water I had for a fish he caught -- we worked it out caveman-style.
0,2,326,KATE,You gave up your last two bottles?
0,2,327,SAWYER,"Water has no value, Freckles -- it's gonna rain sooner or later."
0,2,329,SAYID,"Come on, let's go."
0,2,330,SAWYER,Hey. You forgot something.
0,2,331,SAWYER,"Seeing as you're the sheriff now, might as well make it official."
0,2,338,AUSTRALIAN NEWSCASTER (O.S.),"And wildfires continue to burn just outside Melbourne. While local crews coordinate their efforts, an arson investigation is underway... And the NEWSCAST is interrupted as Jack looks up to see --"
0,2,338,DOCTOR (O.S.),"Mr. Shephard? Will you follow me, please?"
0,2,340,DOCTOR,There are ways we can make it easier for you. We can take a photograph if you'd prefer...
0,2,340,JACK,No. I want to see him.
0,2,346,JACK,That's him.
0,2,347,DOCTOR,I'm very sorry.
0,2,347,JACK,What happened?
0,2,347,DOCTOR JACK,"It's probably best not to -- What happened? know the details, Mr..."
0,2,348,DOCTOR (O.S.),"The police found him in an alley in Kings Cross. There was no identification, so they brought him here. Our tox screen showed a blood alcohol content... which for a man of his size would most likely have brought on myocardial infarction -- a sizeable and fatal heart attack. If it's any consolation, it was painless."
0,2,374,JACK,What do you mean you won't put it on the plane?
0,2,375,TICKET AGENT,"I'm sorry, Mr. Shephard, but our policy is that the body must have the proper documentation if we're to put it on board. I'm afraid there's no latitude to..."
0,2,375,JACK TICKET AGENT,No latitude? No latitude? -- Without the proper documents...
0,2,375,JACK TICKET AGENT,"You can't do this to me. I'm read to go now... -- Sir, perhaps another carrier may..."
0,2,375,JACK,
0,2,376,JACK,"I want you to listen to me, okay? Because I'm asking you a favor... ""Chrissy?"" I am standing in front of you wearing the same suit I'm wearing to my father's funeral and I'm asking you a favor. In sixteen hours I need to land in LAX. And I need that coffin to clear customs because there is going to be a hearse waiting there. And that hearse needs to take me and that coffin to a cemetery. Why, Chrissy? Why can't I just land and bring him to a funeral home and make all the arrangements there? Why can't I really take my time with it? Because I need it to"
0,2,378,JACK,I just need to bury my father.
0,2,379,TICKET AGENT,"Let me see what I can do, sir."
0,2,396,CLAIRE BOONE,How did you...? -- Shhhh.
0,2,396,VOICE (O.S.),Where did you get that?!
0,2,398,CHARLIE,Here's your thief.
0,2,399,MICHAEL,Where'd he hide it?!
0,2,399,CHARLIE,"Dunno -- but this wanker had three bottles on him. Why'd you do it, Pretty Boy? Eh?"
0,2,400,BOONE,I didn't think... You just left it in the tent. And he... Jack just took off.
0,2,400,CHARLIE BOONE,Claire could've died. -- I tried to give her some sooner but it got out of hand. Nobody would've understood...
0,2,400,CHARLIE,I say we throw him in the jungle and see what happens.
0,2,401,KATE,What's going on...?
0,2,401,SAWYER,Guess you got your thief.
0,2,402,BOONE CHARLIE,I was trying to help! Someone needed to take responsibility. It never -- Oh SHUT IT! would have lasted unless...
0,2,413,JACK,It's been six days and we're all still waiting. Still waiting for them to come. But what if they don't?
0,2,414,JACK,We have to stop waiting. We need to start figuring things out. A woman died this morning because she went for a morning swim. He tried to save her life and now you're about to crucify him because he took some water?
0,2,415,JACK,"We can't do this. We can't just hope it'll figure itself out. It's time to start organizing. We need to figure out how we're going to survive. I found water -- fresh water in the valley. I'll take a group in at first light. You don't want to come? Then you find another way to contribute because ""every man for himself"" isn't gonna work anymore, people. Last week, most of us were strangers. But now we're all here. And God knows how long we're gonna be here, but... If we can't live together, we're gonna die alone."
0,2,420,SUN,Thank you. For getting me water today.
0,2,421,JIN,That's what husbands do.
0,2,426,SAWYER (O.S.),How's it feel?
0,2,427,BOONE,How's what feel?
0,2,427,SAWYER,Taking my place at the top of everyone's most hated list.
0,2,427,SAWYER,"Yeah. Sucks, don't it?"
0,2,429,JACK,Thanks.
0,2,430,KATE,"Where were you today, Jack?"
0,2,430,JACK,Just taking care of some things.
0,2,431,KATE,"That's all I'm gonna get, huh?"
0,2,432,JACK,My father died. In Sydney.
0,2,433,KATE,I'm sorry.
0,2,434,JACK,"Yeah. I'm sorry, too."
