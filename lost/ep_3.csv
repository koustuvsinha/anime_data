0,3,4,JIN'S VOICE,What are you doing?
0,3,6,JIN,Sun! I need your help! Come here!
0,3,7,SUN,I'm sorry. I'm coming.
0,3,9,KATE,I want to know.
0,3,9,JACK,Well you're not gonna know.
0,3,9,KATE,What's the big deal?
0,3,9,JACK,It's not a big deal.
0,3,10,KATE,It's just the tattoos and you don't add up. What're you - one of those really hardcore spinal surgeons? Jack smiles -- but how he got his ink is his business.
0,3,10,JACK,Yeah. That's me. Hardcore.
0,3,11,CHARLIE,"If you two are through verbally copulating, maybe we ought to get a move on. We have a beach full of people waiting for us to go get them some drinking water... and the Great White Hunter's getting restless."
0,3,12,JACK,Okay. Let's do this.
0,3,12,KATE,"Hey, Charlie -- Ask Jack about his tattoos."
0,3,12,CHARLIE,Ah. You two have an inside joke. How wonderful for you both.
0,3,17,WAITER,"Another drink, Miss?"
0,3,21,JIN,Miss -- You left something.
0,3,21,SUN,Really? What?
0,3,22,SUN (CONT'D),My father - - is busy being host.
0,3,22,SUN (CONT'D),We need to get away. Now.
0,3,22,JIN,Where?
0,3,22,SUN,America.
0,3,23,JIN,Sun. Look at me. I love you... but I have my honor. I'm not going to kidnap you to another country.
0,3,23,SUN,It's the only chance we have to -
0,3,23,JIN SUN,Your father would never allow it. -- It's not his place to allow...
0,3,23,JIN,Just let me talk to him. I'll make him understand.
0,3,23,SUN,You don't know him.
0,3,23,JIN,I know me. Jin smiles again - radiating megawatt charm. He reaches into his jacket -- pulls out A WHITE ORCHID.
0,3,23,SUN,It's beautiful...
0,3,23,JIN,I wish it were a diamond ring. Someday it will be.
0,3,27,SUN,Jin? What's the matter? Wait...
0,3,28,WALT,Stop! Hey! Stop! Why're you --
0,3,32,WALT SUN,"Do something! He's gonna kill him! Jin, please - let him go -"
0,3,34,SAYID SAWYER,The handcuffs! -- What handcuffs?
0,3,34,SAYID SAWYER,From the Sky Marshal - I don't know what you're -
0,3,34,SAYID,Give them - - or I point him at you and let go.
0,3,35,SAYID (CONT'D),Over here - now! Sawyer LOCKS one cuff onto the wreckage. Sayid secures the second cuff around Jin's wrist and backs away - Jin is cuffed to the landing gear. All eyes turn to Sun:
0,3,35,SAYID (CONT'D),"What happened? Scared and intimidated, Sun takes a step back, alone, on the hook, and unable to communicate -"
0,3,35,JACK,Water's this way -
0,3,35,KATE,How'd you find this place?
0,3,35,JACK,Luck.
0,3,36,KATE,Luck?
0,3,36,JACK,Luck.
0,3,37,JACK,This is it.
0,3,37,LOCKE,It's amazing.
0,3,37,CHARLIE,"Absolutely... it's totally you. Locke looks away from Charlie. Kate, turns to Jack --"
0,3,37,KATE,Some luck.
0,3,38,CHARLIE,Hey - guys... shouldn't somebody look through this stuff? See if there's anything useful in there?
0,3,39,LOCKE,He's got a point.
0,3,39,CHARLIE,I do?
0,3,40,JACK,Yeah. Bring me your bottles - keep your eye out for any medical supplies - drugs in particular.
0,3,40,CHARLIE,Drugs. Right.
0,3,42,VOICE,Don't move.
0,3,43,CHARLIE,"Look, I was just going to take a -"
0,3,43,LOCKE,Do. Not. Move.
0,3,44,LOCKE (CONT'D),Jack... Kate...
0,3,45,JACK,What's going on?
0,3,45,LOCKE,He's standing on a beehive.
0,3,46,CHARLIE,What's a beehive doing there? Beehives are in trees!
0,3,46,JACK,What now?
0,3,46,LOCKE,"If he moves, he'll split the hive."
0,3,47,CHARLIE,I don't like bees - I have an irrational fear of bees - I think I'm allergic to bees - Bees and I -
0,3,47,LOCKE,Will you please be quiet?
0,3,48,LOCKE KATE,We need to find something to seal the hive - From the wreckage? Something we can fit over it?
0,3,48,LOCKE (CONT'D),"Hurry. Just hold on, Charlie -"
0,3,49,CHARLIE,...ohgodohgodohgodohgod...
0,3,51,MICHAEL,"I'm getting sick of saying this, I was just combing the beach with my"
0,3,52,SAYID,Surely there must be something you aren't telling us.
0,3,52,MICHAEL,Surely? Where are you from?
0,3,52,SAYID MICHAEL,Melbourne. Originally.
0,3,53,SAYID,Tikirt. Iraq.
0,3,53,MICHAEL,
0,3,54,SAYID,No. I am not taking off the cuffs - The cuffs stay on.
0,3,54,SAWYER,"Little louder, Omar, maybe then she'll understand you."
0,3,55,HURLEY,"Guys. I got a point-of-order question... that Chinese dude's gonna get crispy out here, how long are we keeping him tied down like that?"
0,3,55,MICHAEL,He can fry for all I care.
0,3,55,SAWYER,"Hey don't look at me, just `cause I got the metal don't mean I got the keys."
0,3,55,SAYID,"He tried to kill Michael. We all saw it, right? He stays cuffed until we know why."
0,3,60,SUN,Well?
0,3,61,JIN,Your father has given his blessing.
0,3,62,SUN,Don't ever do that again! How did you - ?
0,3,62,JIN,"I reasoned with him. After a year of management training and another on the factory floor, we'll have the money to do everything we wanted."
0,3,63,SUN,You're going to work for my father?
0,3,63,JIN,It was the honorable thing to do.
0,3,63,SUN,But -
0,3,63,JIN,"It was the only way to prove I'm... It's temporary. And with that, Jin pulls out a velvet-lined gift box - he opens it before Sun to reveal a BEAUTIFUL ENGAGEMENT RING -"
0,3,63,SUN,Jin - you can't afford this -
0,3,63,JIN,I can now.
0,3,64,CHARLIE,"Are they still coming out? Tell me they're not still coming out. Ohlordallmighty... - Charlie's fear-stricken face: now that dozens of bees have landed on him - BUZZING and FLITTING all over his upper body. For a guy already in the throes of the twitches, this whole standing-still thing is hell on earth."
0,3,65,JACK CHARLIE,"Keep still, man. I'm gonna try to cover the hive... -- this is the most crap idea ever - it's never going to work!"
0,3,65,LOCKE,"Pull yourself together, son."
0,3,65,CHARLIE,"Listen mate, it wouldn't be ""an irrational fear of bees"" if I could just pull myself together - now would it?"
0,3,69,INT. THE VALLEY - CONTINUOUS,"A nightmare. BEES EVERYWHERE. Jack and Kate chew through The Valley, instinctively PULLING OFF their bee-infested clothes. As they power deeper and deeper into safety -"
0,3,74,JACK,It's OK - it's OK...
0,3,75,JACK (CONT'D),"...the bees are gone. - Jack looks down at Kate - slowly realizing just how little they are wearing, and how close they are to one another. Is the moment sexually charged? Yes. Then --"
0,3,75,KATE,There's... skeletons. Skeletons. Dead people.
0,3,76,KATE (CONT'D),Who are they? How'd they...
0,3,76,JACK,I can't exactly perform an autopsy... but there doesn't seem to be any major trauma to their bones... someone laid them to rest here...
0,3,77,KATE,Who?
0,3,77,JACK,Don't know.
0,3,77,KATE,Where'd they come from?
0,3,77,JACK,Didn't you guys shoot a polar bear last week?
0,3,77,KATE,Yeah...?
0,3,77,JACK,"Where'd that come from? Kate shakes her head, almost stifles a grin. Then --"
0,3,77,KATE,Any idea how long they've - Jack gently runs his fingers over the unrecognizable TATTERED CLOTHES hanging off the bones...
0,3,77,JACK,"Long. Takes forty, fifty years for clothing to degrade like this..."
0,3,78,KATE,What is it?
0,3,80,LOCKE'S VOICE,Hello! Anybody in there?
0,3,81,JACK,Over here...
0,3,82,LOCKE,Everyone all right?
0,3,82,JACK KATE,A few stings aside. Yeah. OK.
0,3,82,CHARLIE,Brilliant. You two run away fantastically. Well done. I'm glad my diversion spared you. I was only stung several hundred times. Oh -- and...
0,3,83,CHARLIE (CONT'D),Someone dropped this. Kate sheepishly takes her shirt back --
0,3,83,KATE,It was full of bees.
0,3,83,CHARLIE,"I'd have thought ""C's"", actually."
0,3,84,CHARLIE (CONT'D),Bloody hell! Are those the guys who were here before us?
0,3,85,LOCKE,What are you talking about?
0,3,86,CHARLIE,"Nothing. I mean - just... there could have been people - here - before us, right?"
0,3,87,LOCKE,"This would prove it, but who are these men?"
0,3,87,JACK,"Actually, one of them's female."
0,3,87,LOCKE,Our very own Adam and Eve.
0,3,88,EXT. BEACH - LANDING GEAR WRECKAGE - DAY,"We're back at the BEACH - where SHANNON and BOONE walk past Sun and Jin, keeping their distance -"
0,3,88,BOONE,- all I know is they'd better not let him loose - I heard he even tried to murder the kid. Check out his wife - the guy's homicidal and she's standing by him. Must be a Japanese thing.
0,3,88,SHANNON,She's with him for the same reason I'm hanging out with you. `Cause I have to.
0,3,89,JIN,What are you doing?
0,3,89,SUN,Your skin is very raw... maybe this will help you slip off the cuffs.
0,3,94,JIN'S VOICE,What do you think?
0,3,95,SUN,It's... a puppy...
0,3,96,JIN,"You like it. Good. It was sired by a champion. The breeder has a two-year waiting list -- ...I've been working such long hours, I thought you might enjoy the company. Of course, you'll have to train it and feed it but... they're very loyal and..."
0,3,97,JIN (CONT'D),Are you OK?
0,3,97,SUN,Remember when all you had to give me was an orchid?
0,3,99,JIN,Your father...
0,3,101,SUN,Jin - please - just let me go and explain this to them. Maybe they'll let you go and -
0,3,102,JIN,How will you explain? Your place is by my side. And we will not explain ourselves to a thief.
0,3,105,LOCKE,I think one of us ought to stay and help Charlie salvage the wreckage.
0,3,105,KATE,Are you offering?
0,3,106,LOCKE,Sure. Gives me a chance to get to know Mr. Pace a little better. That's his last name.
0,3,108,KATE,Ready to move out? People are probably getting thirsty... What?
0,3,108,JACK,Forty-six people need to drink a half gallon a day each. Carrying all this water back and forth? It's gonna be a real pain in the ass.
0,3,108,KATE,You're making me regret volunteering.
0,3,108,JACK,These caves make too good a shelter to just be used for burial. Adam and Eve must have lived here.
0,3,110,JACK (CONT'D),"The bodies were placed there decades, maybe centuries ago. So their plane crashed - or maybe they were shipwrecked - they probably found this place and knew they could survive here. Unlimited fresh water..."
0,3,110,JA CK (CONT'D),...tree canopy keeps the temperature down - shields out the sun - caves for shelter and food storage - and the entrances are narrow - easier to protect from predators. We don't need to bring the water to the people... We need to bring the people to the water.
0,3,111,JACK (CONT'D),I think we can live here.
0,3,117,MICHAEL,What are you doing man? Did you say something to my kid?
0,3,118,MICHAEL (CONT'D),"Move it, Walt."
0,3,119,MICHAEL (CONT'D),"Yeah. Nice talking to you, too."
0,3,120,WALT,Why doesn't he like us?
0,3,121,MICHAEL,What?
0,3,121,WALT,The Korean man -- you said people like him don't like people like us.
0,3,122,MICHAEL,"Aw - man. No. I don't think like that, OK? I was just... angry."
0,3,122,WALT,So what'd you do to him?
0,3,124,MICHAEL,What did I do?
0,3,125,MICHAEL (CONT'D),"Tell me. You've been with me since we crashed here - have you seen me do anything? To anyone? I mean - - what kind of man do you think I am, anyway?"
0,3,126,MICHAEL (CONT'D),What did your mother say about me?
0,3,126,WALT,She never talked about you.
0,3,127,MICHAEL,"You don't know a thing about me, do you?"
0,3,127,WALT,You don't know a thing about me.
0,3,127,MICHAEL,I know a lot about you.
0,3,127,WALT,Yeah? When's my birthday?
0,3,127,MICHAEL,August 24. When's mine?
0,3,130,CHARLIE,This is just brilliant.
0,3,131,CHARLIE (CONT'D),Are you following me?
0,3,131,LOCKE,Yes.
0,3,131,CHARLIE,No need - just going to the loo.
0,3,132,LOCKE,"Is there something you want to tell me, Charlie?"
0,3,133,CHARLIE,I'm. Going. To. The. Loo.
0,3,134,LOCKE,"It's dangerous out there. Until we get back to the beach, I'm not breaking line of sight with you."
0,3,134,CHARLIE,"This is a joke, right?"
0,3,134,LOCKE,How are those bee stings?
0,3,134,CHARLIE,"Oh, bugger off."
0,3,135,LOCKE,I know who you are. And I know what you're looking for.
0,3,136,LOCKE (CONT'D),Drive Shaft. You played bass.
0,3,137,CHARLIE,And guitar. On a few tracks. You've really heard of us?
0,3,137,LOCKE,"Hey. Just because I'm over forty doesn't mean I'm deaf. I have both your albums - although - your self- titled debut was a much stronger effort than ""Oil Change."" That bass line in track six, ""Full Release"" - you were on fire."
0,3,138,CHARLIE,Sixteen clean notes in one bar.
0,3,138,LOCKE,Shame what happened to the band. How long since you last played?
0,3,139,CHARLIE,"You guitar? Eight days, eleven hours. Give or take."
0,3,139,LOCKE,You miss it.
0,3,140,LOCKE (CONT'D),Still a lot of wreckage. It might turn up.
0,3,141,CHARLIE,"Undamaged? Playable? I don't think so. I wish - but - see, there was this bloke at the counter what made me check it in. No room in the cabin. Fascist. I had this sick feeling in the pit of my stomach when they put it on that belt. I should have known I'd never see it again."
0,3,141,LOCKE,You'll see it again.
0,3,141,CHARLIE,Yeah. What makes you so sure about that?
0,3,142,LOCKE,"Because I have faith, Charlie."
0,3,144,EXT. BEACH - LANDING GEAR WRECKAGE - DAY,"- where Sun jams a barrette in the cuffs, trying to pick the lock. Jin, whose wrist is now bleeding, talks her through:"
0,3,144,JIN,- be gentle - you're going to hit the catch eventually and then -
0,3,145,JIN (CONT'D),Now try it again. This time try to do exactly as I say.
0,3,146,INT. LAVISH SEOUL APARTMENT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK,The place has changed - become more and more ornate. A gilded cage for Sun - who sleeps on the couch with her now fully-grown Shar-Pei. A clock reads 4 A.M. Sun is still in her street clothes - she has been waiting for her husband -
0,3,148,SUN,Jin?
0,3,149,SUN (CONT'D),Are you all right? What's --
0,3,151,SUN,Please talk to me -
0,3,153,SUN (CONT'D),"- oh god, are you hurt? What happened to you? Jin turns on the faucet and washes his hands. Rust-colored water hits the basin. Sun reaches for Jin's hands - quickly realizing that the blood on them is not her husband's -"
0,3,153,SUN (CONT'D),Whose blood is this?
0,3,154,SUN (CONT'D),What were you doing? What happened?
0,3,155,JIN,"I was working. Jin tries to go back to washing his hands, but Sun won't just accept this - she needs to know -"
0,3,155,SUN,Doing what? Jin - my father is in the car business - you couldn't possibly - - what do you do for my father? Just answer me - please - Jin - look at me - what do you do -
0,3,158,JIN,I do whatever your father asks. I do it for us.
0,3,159,JIN (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D),"- that's the catch - now twist it, slowly - don't lose it -"
0,3,159,EXT. BEACH - LANDING GEAR WRECKAGE - RESUMING,"- on Sun's face as she keeps working the lock, following her husband's instructions until the barrette SNAPS. Painfully wrenching Jin's wrist. Jin lets out a loud BELLOW."
0,3,160,JIN,I want you to get me a knife. The sharpest you can find.
0,3,160,SUN,What for?
0,3,161,JIN,"We're all alone, Sun. You're all I have left. I'm not going to let them take away our honor. I'm going to cut off my thumb. I'm getting out of these cuffs. And then I'm going to go get back what's mine."
0,3,165,KATE,Are you checking me out?
0,3,166,JACK,What?
0,3,166,KATE,No shame in --
0,3,166,JACK,"Trust me, if I were checking you out, you'd know it."
0,3,166,KATE,Yeah? What are you thinking - right now -
0,3,166,JACK KATE,"Well, I sure as hell wasn't - Don't stop to think - just tell me -"
0,3,166,JACK,I was thinking that if we lived at the caves we could build a dam around the spring - so everyone would be able to get fresh water - and we could get the infirmary off the beach.
0,3,168,JACK (CONT'D),You think it's a bad idea?
0,3,169,KATE,No - it makes sense.
0,3,169,JACK KATE,But? -- No but.
0,3,169,JACK,Good because a lot of people are still hoping a rescue boat's gonna show up - they aren't thinking about their own safety - - we're gonna have a lot of convincing to do.
0,3,169,KATE,We? You haven't convinced me yet.
0,3,170,SAYID'S VOICE,It's about time -
0,3,172,SAYID,- I'm dying of thirst.
0,3,172,EXT. JUNGLE - PATH TO THE BEACH - LATER,"His logs and axe on a pile on the ground, Sayid opens a bottle and drinks as he briefs Jack and Kate --"
0,3,172,SAYID,"I am going to let the Korean man sit in the sun a while longer - once I have enough wood for our signal fire, I'll take his wife aside - find some way to communicate. I think she knows why he attacked Michael."
0,3,172,JACK,You sure you don't want me to talk to her?
0,3,174,JACK (CONT'D),
0,3,175,JA CK (CONT'D),I'm going to start talking to people about the caves. I might be able to get a few to go with me by nightfall - start setting up a camp.
0,3,175,SAYID,You're serious? Is there a reason you didn't consult us when you decided to form your own civilization?
0,3,175,JACK,I'm talking about moving a couple of miles inland -
0,3,175,SAYID,"Whatever happened to ""live together, die alone?"""
0,3,175,JACK,Digging in - together - is the only way we can survive...
0,3,175,SAYID,"Our best hope of survival is being spotted by a plane or a ship - and for that we need to organize everyone - to keep that signal fire burning while others scout the island for supplies - ""digging in"" anywhere else is suicide."
0,3,175,KATE,"It's the only source of fresh water we've found, Sayid."
0,3,175,SAYID,Don't tell me you're part of this insanity.
0,3,175,JACK,"And staying here - without water, in the sun - that's not suicide?"
0,3,176,SAYID,I have better things to do with my life than to admit defeat.
0,3,179,INT. THE VALLEY - DAY,Charlie and Locke pull A SHATTERED GRANDFATHER CLOCK from the wreckage:
0,3,179,CHARLIE,A grandfather clock? Who travels with a grandfather clock?
0,3,179,LOCKE,"Must have been freight. And we can see that Charlie is in a STATE. Frustrated. Pale, sweaty... needing a fix, goddammit. Dropping the clock --"
0,3,179,CHARLIE,Well that's it - I'm not spending any more valuable time of my day pulling everyone else's crap but mine out of this stinking fuselage!
0,3,180,LOCKE,It's dangerous out there.
0,3,180,CHARLIE,What is it with you? Don't think I can handle it?
0,3,181,LOCKE CHARLIE,Frankly - no. -- Piss off.
0,3,181,LOCKE,"Listen - - and Charlie finally SNAPS, writhing out of Locke's grasp -"
0,3,181,CHARLIE,"No - you listen - you don't know sod-all about dangerous. Last I heard, only one of us has seen a man - THE PILOT OF OUR PLANE - torn to bits by a beast - and - oh wait, that was me! Not that I got a chance to savor the experience seeing as I was dodging a falling cockpit at the time - and as I remember - it was me, not you, climbing up a MOUNTAIN and got jumped by a POLAR BEAR - just to hear from a Frenchy radio signal that somehow's been broadcasting for sixteen years that this island is a death trap and that everyone who lands here SNUFFS IT! And worst of all, I'm never going to find my bloody guitar!"
0,3,182,LOCKE,I'm still not letting you out of my sight.
0,3,185,MICHAEL,"Now what? I already gave you my statement, Sheriff. Sayid takes the hit in stride, then --"
0,3,185,SAYID,I came to apologize. I shouldn't have been suspicious - you were the victim in the attack this morning.
0,3,186,MICHAEL,I appreciate that - but I can tell you didn't come all the way here just to say you're sorry.
0,3,187,SAYID,"People are seriously considering following Jack to the caves. Michael looks out to see Jack, ACROSS THE BEACH - talking to a few castaways - making converts."
0,3,187,SAYID (CONT'D),I'd like to know where you stand.
0,3,187,MICHAEL,"Right here. I got one priority right now, and that's getting my kid off this island. A boat passes by, I'm not gonna be on the hook for missing it."
0,3,187,SAYID,"Good. I'm lining a pit with metal from the plane, for a signal fire."
0,3,188,MICHAEL,Need my help?
0,3,188,SAYID,We burned most of our wood when we torched the fuselage. Whatever you can carry.
0,3,191,EXT. BEACH - HURLEY'S CORNER - DAY,- where HURLEY packs his things.
0,3,191,JACK,Glad you're coming.
0,3,191,HURLEY,"Hey, man -- I go where the boar's at."
0,3,191,JACK,View's not bad either.
0,3,191,HURLEY,So... what up with you and Kate?
0,3,191,JACK,"""What up?"""
0,3,191,HURLEY,You know what I mean. What up?
0,3,192,HURLEY (CONT'D),C'mon -- you guys gonna move into a cave together? She'd look just like Wilma if she put a bone in her hair and dude? Wilma's hot.
0,3,192,JACK,I'm sorry. Am I in High School?
0,3,192,HURLEY,"I knew it. You are like, so over that whole ""she's on the run from Johnny Law"" thing aren't you?"
0,3,192,JACK,Just get your stuff together - we need to go soon.
0,3,192,HURLEY,That wasn't a denial!
0,3,193,EXT. BEACH - SECLUDED AREA - DAY,"- Kate. Sitting. Looking at the sea, letting the water hit her toes, a near-perfect moment wrecked by Sawyer's arrival."
0,3,193,SAWYER,"Well well well, if it ain't the Belle of the Ball. So what's it like having both the doctor and Cap'n Falafel fighting over you?"
0,3,194,SAWYER (CONT'D),"Just calling `em like I see `em, freckles."
0,3,195,SA WYER (CONT'D),"Truth be told, I'm not the only person wondering where you're going to weigh in on this whole ""moving off the beach"" thing."
0,3,195,KATE,Please.
0,3,195,SAWYER,"Hey -- Jacko may be saving lives, but everyone here knows you went to get the transceiver, and hunt boar, and send the distress signal... even if they don't know how that worked out. Kate looks at Sawyer - and the plainness of her question makes it clear that she DOES care what he says and does:"
0,3,195,KATE,Are you going?
0,3,195,SAWYER,"That's the real trick, isn't it? We all pack up stakes to the caves, and the next day a plane passes by - they're gonna go on their merry way and be none the wiser... On the other hand, you stay here and get eaten by boars or fall off a rock - there isn't gonna be anyone around to answer the 911 call, am I right?"
0,3,195,KATE,You didn't answer my question.
0,3,195,SAWYER,"You didn't answer mine. And I asked first. Sayonara, sugarpop."
0,3,196,EXT. BAMBOO FOREST - DAY,As Sun walks through the bamboo trees with a purpose -
0,3,200,DECORATOR,Your husband told me that money is no object to redecorate this place. You're a very lucky wife.
0,3,200,SUN,"Yes. But they are interrupted when Jin snaps his fingers, pointing at the dog. Sun stands and leads the dog away from her"
0,3,203,DECORATOR,"Let's look at the place from the bedroom, shall we?"
0,3,206,DECORATOR,Are you sure about this?
0,3,206,SUN,Yes.
0,3,206,DECORATOR SUN,You've taken your lessons? Studied? -- Yes.
0,3,209,DECORATOR,"You realize that your husband, and your father will do everything they can to find you - - are you sure you and your husband can't reconcile - talk?"
0,3,210,SUN,"When I'm gone, will you care for my dog? The Decorator nods, then hands over the folio:"
0,3,210,DECORATOR,There's no coming back from this.
0,3,213,DECORATOR (CONT'D),"During his business trip. At the airport. At eleven fifteen you make an excuse and walk out of the terminal. Bring nothing. A car will be waiting - for the first week your family will assume you have been kidnapped. You will lay low until they come to think you are dead. After that, you will be free to move wherever you want."
0,3,214,SUN,"At the airport, eleven fifteen..."
0,3,214,DECORATOR,Again.
0,3,215,SUN,Eleven fifteen... Eleven fifteen...
0,3,217,EXT. BAMBOO FOREST - RESUMING,-- the look on Sun's face is a match for the end of the flashback. Michael gathers up the chopped wood and turns just as she closes the distance --
0,3,218,MICHAEL,"Oh great, look who came to chat. No offense but I really don't have time to -"
0,3,219,SUN,I need to talk to you.
0,3,224,MICHAEL,You speak English.
0,3,224,SUN,Yes.
0,3,224,MICHAEL SUN,You speak English? Yes.
0,3,224,MICHAEL,Why didn't you saying anything?
0,3,225,SUN,My husband doesn't know.
0,3,225,MICHAEL,Why would you learn English without telling your husband?
0,3,225,SUN,He has a temper -
0,3,225,MICHAEL,- yeah but - - were you going to leave him? Is that why you didn't -
0,3,226,SUN,What my husband did to you today - it was a misunderstanding.
0,3,226,MICHAEL,No - I got it loud and clear.
0,3,226,SUN,It was the watch.
0,3,227,MICHAEL,Your husband tried to murder me over a watch? I found this two days ago...
0,3,227,SUN,And he has been looking for it for five. It belongs to my father. He entrusted it to my husband.
0,3,228,SUN (CONT'D),"My father is a very powerful man. The watch was a gift for one of his American business associates. It was my husband's job to deliver it in my father's name. My husband has spent years working for my father - earning his trust, his respect. Protecting that watch is a question of honor."
0,3,228,MICHAEL,Honor? Trying to kill me in front of my kid - that's honor?
0,3,228,SUN,You don't know my father.
0,3,229,SUN (CONT'D),My husband has to be stopped. I need your help.
0,3,233,CHARLIE,Listen to me you old git. I'm going into the jungle. A man has... has a right to privacy. So leave me ALONE.
0,3,234,LOCKE,Just hand them to me. - and that's when Charlie's stare breaks.
0,3,234,LOCKE (CONT'D),"You're going to run out. My guess is sooner rather than later. Painful detox is inevitable... give them up now, and at least it will be your choice."
0,3,234,CHARLIE,Don't talk to me like - like you know something about me.
0,3,234,LOCKE,"I know a lot more about pain than you think. I don't envy what you're facing - but I want to help. Charlie is torn. Someone is finally on to his secret - and, instead of judging, wants to help him escape."
0,3,234,LOCKE (CONT'D),Do you want your guitar?
0,3,236,LOCKE (CONT'D),More than your drugs?
0,3,236,CHARLIE,More than you could know.
0,3,236,LOCKE,What I know is this island might just give you what you're looking for... but you have to give the island something in return.
0,3,237,CHARLIE,Can you really find my guitar?
0,3,238,LOCKE,"Look up, Charlie."
0,3,238,CHARLIE,Don't tell me you want me to pray or something -
0,3,238,LOCKE,- I want you to look up.
0,3,241,CHARLIE,I never thought -
0,3,242,LOCKE,"I know. I know. Come on, Charlie. I'll help you get it down."
0,3,244,JACK,"Hey. Almost time to go. Kate hates this - disappointing Jack is the last thing she wants to do, but she has no choice -"
0,3,244,KATE,I don't want to be Eve.
0,3,244,JACK,No one's asking you to.
0,3,245,KATE,I just can't dig in.
0,3,247,JACK,Why not? Someone else can stay here -- keep a lookout -- wait for rescue. Why does it have to be you?
0,3,247,KATE,It's not that.
0,3,247,JACK,Then what is it?
0,3,248,JACK (CONT'D),"How did you get to be this way? Just what did you do, Kate?"
0,3,249,KATE,You had your chance to know - you don't get to ask again.
0,3,250,JACK,"If you need me, you know where to find me. Kate turns as Jack exits, then, under her breath:"
0,3,250,KATE,You know where to find me too.
0,3,251,EXT. BEACH - LANDING GEAR WRECKAGE - DAY,We're EXTREMELY TIGHT on the crash axe. PULL BACK to find it tightly in the grip of --
0,3,253,MICHAEL,I know you can't understand a word - and normally I'm not the talking- out-loud type - but since I have a captive audience - I hope for your sake that you LISTEN.
0,3,254,MICHAEL (CONT'D),"I'm not exactly having the best month of my life. A woman I had a relationship with ten years ago died halfway around the world - I barely know my son... and now I gotta be his daddy. Then there was the little accident that put us in this hell hole - and to top it off, I have a deranged Korean guy trying to kill me - and for what?"
0,3,255,MICHAEL (CONT'D),"I get it: you have an insane code- of-honor thing with your father-in- law, and delivering this watch to one of his cronies was the one thing you were living for - that just makes you stupid - but to try and kill a man? I'd have given it back if you'd asked. My watch broke."
0,3,255,MI CHAE L (CONT'D),"I found this in the wreckage and, hey, I figured why let a twenty thousand dollar watch go to waste..."
0,3,255,MI CHAE L (CONT'D),"which is ridiculous since time doesn't matter on a damn island. So - you want your watch back - I'm giving it to you. Not because you tried to kill me, but because I am not a thief."
0,3,257,MICHAEL (CONT'D),Stay away from me and my kid.
0,3,260,SUN'S VOICE (PRE-LAP),Eleven fifteen - eleven fifteen - eleven fifteen...
0,3,261,JACK,"In sixteen hours, I need to land in"
0,3,261,JA CK (CONT'D),And I need that coffin to clear customs because there is going to be a hearse waiting there.
0,3,262,SUN,Eleven fifteen - eleven fifteen...
0,3,275,JIN,Something wrong?
0,3,276,SUN,No. It's beautiful.
0,3,278,EXT. BEACH - LANDING GEAR WRECKAGE - RESUMING,"As Jin walks away - C.U. on Jin's hand. As Sun's hand enters frame, slipping into his palm."
0,3,280,JACK,
0,3,281,JIN,"The doctor has a point - leaving the beach is the right thing to do - and we'd better stay close to him, in case one of us gets sick -"
0,3,282,JIN (CONT'D),- and I can always come back and fish in daytime - this place can't be so far away that -
0,3,283,JIN (CONT'D),"I'm still talking - Sun! What are you doing? I'm not finished - Sun turns, looks at her husband -"
0,3,283,SUN,Don't you want to move on?
0,3,287,JIN,My apologies.
0,3,289,MICHAEL,"I don't speak Korean. But the word you're looking for is ""Sorry."" ""Sorry."" Jin regards Michael, then:"
0,3,289,JIN,Sorry.
0,3,290,MICHAEL,Now my kid.
0,3,291,JIN,Sorry.
0,3,293,JIN (CONT'D),Sun! Wait!
0,3,295,INT. THE VALLEY - LATER,"- where Charlie sits in one of the niches on the rockface, cradling his newly-returned instrument."
0,3,297,JACK (O.S.),Hello!
0,3,298,LOCKE,What's this?
0,3,299,JACK,New tenants.
0,3,300,HURLEY,A short walk - they lied.
0,3,302,INT. THE VALLEY - NIGHT,"Jack and several others at the spring - fill up water containers, drink without fear of running out -"
0,3,303,INT. THE VALLEY - NIGHT,"- while Locke puts together a bonfire in the middle of The Valley. Jack watches - everyone seems content: whatever Kate and Sayid might say, this will be a good place to live."
0,3,306,WALT,Can I ask you something?
0,3,306,MICHAEL,"Anything you want, man."
0,3,306,WALT,"When's your birthday? Michael smiles, kneels next to his son, putting an arm around him. As the two talk - a bridge forming between them..."
0,3,306,INT. THE VALLEY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS,"Where Jack watches the bonfire, thinking of Kate..."
