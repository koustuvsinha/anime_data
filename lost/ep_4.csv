0,4,5,LOCKE (O.S.),Charlie--
0,4,7,CHARLIE,"Uh, N-no thanks, Locke. Think I'll stay in today."
0,4,10,KATE (O.S.),I take better pictures than that.
0,4,13,JACK,Just came to pick up a few things.
0,4,14,KATE,So... You're not staying.
0,4,14,JACK,Hurley and I... We've been checking out in the valley... And they're a hell of a lot safer than living out here on the beach.
0,4,14,KATE,You're mad at me.
0,4,15,JACK,"No. Kate, I'm-- I just don't understand why you won't come with me -- us. The caves are--"
0,4,15,KATE,"We crashed eight days ago. I'm not setting up house here, Jack."
0,4,15,JACK,"Look, I want off this island too. But we both know that's not gonna happen anytime soon."
0,4,16,KATE,Sayid... He has a plan...
0,4,16,JACK,To find the source of the distress signal. Yeah. I remember.
0,4,16,KATE,The transmission's coming from somewhere on the island. If we can find it --
0,4,16,JACK,"-- That signal's been playing on a loop for sixteen years. The woman who left it wasn't rescued, what makes you think it'll be different for us?"
0,4,16,KATE,Because I believe it.
0,4,17,JACK,I wish I shared your faith.
0,4,17,SAWYER (O.S.),Wouldn't mind sharing a few things with her myself.
0,4,18,KATE,"What do you want, Sawyer?"
0,4,18,SAWYER,"Not a thing, sweetheart. Heard the doc here was vacating the premises. Thought I'd best lay claim to my new digs before somebody else does."
0,4,19,JACK,I didn't build this for you to live in -- it's an infirmary.
0,4,19,SAWYER,"Not without a doctor around it ain't. Yep, I could fix this place up real nice."
0,4,20,JACK,Fine. Take the tent.
0,4,20,KATE,Jack...
0,4,20,JACK,I'll see you later. And Jack goes. Sawyer comes up behind her.
0,4,20,SAWYER,"Offer on the tent stands, Freckles. Think about it."
0,4,24,CHARLIE,Locke? Th-that you?
0,4,27,CHARLIE,It's been a week since my last confession.
0,4,28,PRIEST,"Go ahead, my son."
0,4,28,CHARLIE,"Last night, I had... physical... relations... with a girl I... I didn't even know."
0,4,28,PRIEST,I see. Anything else?
0,4,28,CHARLIE,"Yeah. Then, uh... right after that I had... y'know... relations with another girl."
0,4,28,PRIEST,"Two girls. Well, that's--"
0,4,28,CHARLIE,And then... I watched while they had... relations with each other. SILENCE. And we can read on Charlie's face that this ISN'T a joke -- that he is TRULY CONFLICTED. At war with himself.
0,4,28,PRIEST,
0,4,28,CHARLIE,"See, it's my band, Father. Drive Shaft... We've been playing this club in Manchester and... well, we're starting to get some real heat... A following, like... And these girls... they... well... There's some serious temptations that come with the territory. If you know what I mean."
0,4,28,PRIEST,"Yes, well... We all have our temptations, but giving in to them, that's your choice. I know it's difficult, but find strength in your faith. Your family... Say five Our Fathers and two Hail Marys and you will be absolved."
0,4,29,IAN (O.S.),And the meek shall inherit the earth.
0,4,31,CHARLIE,Ian -- You're in a church! Get your sodden boots off there. Ian does so as Charlie wipes the pew with his jacket sleeve.
0,4,31,IAN,"Relax, Choir Boy. I bring tidings of great joy..."
0,4,38,LOCKE (O.S.),"Nicely done, Charlie..."
0,4,42,CHARLIE,
0,4,44,CHARLIE,You hear what I said? I want my
0,4,45,LOCKE,Yet you gave them to me. Hmmm.
0,4,45,CHARLIE,"And bloody well regret it. I'm sick, man. Can't you see that?"
0,4,45,LOCKE,"I think you're a lot stronger than you know, Charlie. And I'm gonna prove it to you..."
0,4,47,CHARLIE,Why-- Why are you doing this? To torture me? Just throw them away -- Get rid of `em and be done with it!
0,4,47,LOCKE,"If I did that, you wouldn't have a choice, Charlie. CHARLIE reacts, remembering the words of his priest as LOCKE grabs the netting surrounding the squealing boar."
0,4,51,SAYID,Three antennas. Three points of a triangle. One here on the beach...
0,4,55,BOONE,Of course there are.
0,4,55,SAYID,The power cells I've grafted onto the antennas are drained. There's no telling how long they'll last. A minute. Maybe more. Maybe less.
0,4,55,KATE,So we all have to be in position before we switch them on.
0,4,55,BOONE,"Whoa, wait a minute, how are we supposed to do that? There's no way to communicate with each other."
0,4,56,KATE,Bottle rockets?
0,4,56,SAYID,"God bless firework smugglers. When I'm in position, I'll fire off my rocket. When you two see it, fire yours. After the last one goes up, we'll all switch on our antennas."
0,4,56,KATE,You said there were two complications.
0,4,56,SAYID,"The battery in the transceiver is dead. And I've yet to find a suitable replacement. Without the transceiver, all of this is for nothing... Something from a PDA or, better yet, a laptop computer would probably work... but... I've been unable to salvage any from the wreckage."
0,4,57,KATE,Think I might know where to look.
0,4,60,JIN (O.S.),Hey! You!
0,4,63,CHARLIE,Morning.
0,4,64,HURLEY (O.S.),Jack... Dude... What's in these things -- cinder blocks?
0,4,65,JACK,Packed anything I thought'd be useful here... without leaving the others empty-handed.
0,4,66,CHARLIE,Hey. Need a hand?
0,4,66,JACK,No thanks. I think we're good.
0,4,66,CHARLIE,I don't mind. Used to lug around my band's equipment back in the
0,4,67,JACK,Charlie. No. The zipper's--
0,4,69,CHARLIE,"Aw, hell. Sorry... I was just trying to--"
0,4,69,JACK,"Help. I know. It's okay. Hurley, why don't we grab those last couple of bags."
0,4,69,HURLEY,"Oh, could we?"
0,4,72,JACK (O.S.),What are you doing?
0,4,73,CHARLIE,"Oh. Um... I've got a bit of a headache. So, I thought..."
0,4,74,JACK,Valium?
0,4,74,CHARLIE,Couldn't... find any aspirin.
0,4,75,JACK,"It's not self-serve, Charlie. This medicine may have to last us awhile. Gotta save it for things more serious than a headache..."
0,4,75,CHARLIE,Yeah. Yeah... You're right.
0,4,76,JACK,You okay? You're looking a little--
0,4,77,CHARLIE,Told you. Just a headache.
0,4,77,JACK,Leave it. Get some water. Maybe you're dehydrated...
0,4,77,CHARLIE,Just want to be useful --
0,4,78,JACK,"Charlie, I got it. We don't need you right now. Go take care of yourself, man."
0,4,79,IAN (PRE-LAP),"C'mon, Charlie-boy... We can't do this without you..."
0,4,80,IAN,Face it... You're the heart and soul of the band. You are bloody Drive Shaft.
0,4,80,CHARLIE,Watch the language.
0,4,80,IAN,Sod that. This is our shot at the big-time. What's the problem?
0,4,80,CHARLIE,I dunno... I just... I want to keep things the way they are. Playing the pubs. It's enough for me.
0,4,81,IAN,"Yeah, fine for you. You're the smart one. Be anything you want. It's your songs that got us signed. I'm just the clown with the pretty face that sings `em. Now you wanna take away my chance to be somebody."
0,4,82,CHARLIE,"Ian, it's not about you. It's... Look, I love the band, but... It's not who I am. Sometimes... I get lost in it."
0,4,83,IAN,"Won't happen. `Cause we'll be there looking out for each other. What brothers do, right?"
0,4,84,CHARLIE,"Ian -- Stop that, you lunatic."
0,4,84,IAN,Now you sound like Mum.
0,4,85,CHARLIE,Just promise me... If things... get too crazy... No matter what... If I say we're done... We walk away.
0,4,85,IAN,We walk away.
0,4,85,CHARLIE,You swear it.
0,4,85,IAN,"You're the rock god, baby brother."
0,4,86,KATE,Why don't I believe you?
0,4,87,SAWYER,"Couldn't say, cupcake. Most folks think I got a trustworthy face. Or so they tell me."
0,4,87,KATE,You've been hoarding like a packrat since the crash and you don't have a single laptop?!
0,4,88,SAWYER,"We are testy, aren't we? Still upset about your little breakup?"
0,4,88,KATE,What?
0,4,88,SAWYER,Musta hurt bad when Doc came back for his record collection... Cause now there's nothing for him to come back for.
0,4,89,KATE,"God, it must be so exhausting..."
0,4,89,SAWYER,What's that?
0,4,89,KATE,"Living like a parasite. Always talking, never giving..."
0,4,89,SAWYER,"Boy, you sure got me pegged."
0,4,89,KATE,I get it now. It all makes sense. You don't want to get off this island because there's nothing for you to go back to. There's no one you miss. And no one misses you.
0,4,89,SAWYER,Awww. Feelin' sorry for me. How sweet.
0,4,89,KATE,I don't feel sorry for you. I pity you.
0,4,90,SAWYER,All you had to do was say please.
0,4,91,HURLEY (O.S.),Hey. Dude. This yours?
0,4,92,CHARLIE,"Yeah. Probably wondering `cause I'm known for playing bass in Drive Shaft. S'only `cause we could never find a decent bass player... Wrote a bunch of songs with that guitar. ""You All Everybody."" That was mine. Got the idea from --"
0,4,92,HURLEY,"Listen, man, Just just wants you to find another place for this thing. He's moving supplies and says it's in the way."
0,4,93,CHARLIE (O.S.),"You know, most people look up to me. Respect me --"
0,4,94,JACK CHARLIE,"Charlie -- ? -- And you treat me like a bloody child, like some useless joke -- -- What are you talking -- -- I'm not good enough to help. Right? No. No, I'm just in the way --"
0,4,95,JACK,"You okay, man? C'mon, sit down. Let me take a look at you --"
0,4,95,CHARLIE JACK,"-- Right. You'll look out for me. We look out for each other... Well, stuff that -- -- Charlie, calm down. You're not yourself --"
0,4,95,CHARLIE,You don't know me! I'm a bloody rock god!!
0,4,97,SUN,You should have the doctor look at your wrist.
0,4,97,JIN,It's fine. It will heal --
0,4,100,SUN,It's too hot.
0,4,103,HURLEY,"Aw, no... ANGLE ON CAVE ENTRANCE - A THICK CLOUD OF DUST bursting from it. HANDHELD -- CHOATIC --"
0,4,109,CHARLIE,
0,4,109,HURLEY CHARLIE,"Dude, we gotta get help. -- Happened so fast..."
0,4,110,HURLEY,Charlie! You gotta run to the beach and get help! Now!
0,4,110,CHARLIE,Right. On it. He runs off. Stay with Hurley as he calls after him --
0,4,110,HURLEY,Make sure you tell Kate!
0,4,112,SAYID,What is it?
0,4,112,KATE,I dunno. Felt like a goose just walked over my grave. Something my dad used to say. When he got the feeling something bad just happened. You ever get that?
0,4,112,SAYID,Only about every thirty seconds.
0,4,113,KATE,"What we're doing. I mean, chasing some phantom distress signal -- What are the odds of this working?"
0,4,113,SAYID,No worse than the odds of us surviving that plane crash.
0,4,113,KATE,People survive plane crashes all the time.
0,4,113,SAYID,"Not like this one. The tail section broke off when we were still in the air. The cockpit separated some time later... Our section cart-wheeled through the jungle, completely crushing those who died. And yet we escaped with nothing more than a few scrapes. How do you explain that?"
0,4,113,KATE,"Blind, dumb luck."
0,4,113,SAYID,No one is that lucky. We shouldn't have survived.
0,4,113,KATE,"So... what -- We're dead? And this... is, what, Hell?"
0,4,114,SAYID,Of course not. That's insane... All I'm saying is that perhaps there's a reason we're still alive.
0,4,114,KATE,"Divine intervention? Sorry, Sayid... but things just happen. No rhyme or reason to it."
0,4,114,SAYID,"Tell that to your goose. AND OFF KATE, as they forge deeper into the unknown..."
0,4,114,CHARLIE,
0,4,114,MICHAEL,"What's wrong, man?"
0,4,114,CHARLIE,It's Jack. He's trapped! There was a cave-in...
0,4,115,BOONE CHARLIE,What? How -- ? -- Cave collapsed. Don't even know if he's alive... We gotta get him out...
0,4,116,MICHAEL,"Hey, you... Scott!"
0,4,116,STEVE,I'm Steve. He's Scott.
0,4,116,MICHAEL,We got an emergency. Grab a couple more guys and c'mon --
0,4,116,CHARLIE,Yeah. We gotta move. Follow me...
0,4,117,BOONE,"Shannon, you need to do something"
0,4,118,SHANNON,Uh... why?
0,4,118,BOONE,"Kate and Sayid are triangulating the French signal. But the antenna's power is weak, so you have to wait until they fire off their bottle rockets... Then you fire off this one. Then turn on the antenna. Got it?"
0,4,119,SHANNON,The switch is where now?
0,4,119,BOONE,Did you hear a word I said?
0,4,119,SHANNON,"Look, don't get mad at me because the Professor and Maryann have a confusing frigging plan..."
0,4,119,BOONE,"Can you do it or can't you? Shannon shakes her head, but petulantly takes the ROCKET --"
0,4,119,SHANNON BOONE,Yeah. I can do it. -- If you can't...
0,4,119,SHANNON,"Go save the world already. I can. Boone nods. Runs off to join the others, all heading into the jungle. We pick up CHARLIE, who stops abruptly -- doubles back -- realizing someone's missing --"
0,4,119,CHARLIE,Wait. Kate. I gotta let Kate know about Jack.
0,4,119,SAWYER (O.S.),"Sorry, sport, you just missed her..."
0,4,121,CHARLIE,Which way?
0,4,121,SAWYER,"Don't sweat it, amigo. I know which way they went."
0,4,126,THE STUPID PEOPLE...,"Charlie snaps a look over at Ian, who wails away --"
0,4,128,RECORD EXEC,"Killer, Ian. Just killer."
0,4,129,CHARLIE,What the hell was that out there?
0,4,129,IAN,Uh... Another kick-ass show? You were bloody brilliant!
0,4,129,CHARLIE,"I sing the intro to ""You All Everybody."""
0,4,129,IAN,"Oh, yeah... Sorry about that, man. Just...got caught up in the moment. Like the crowd wanted it, y'know... Won't happen again. I swear..."
0,4,129,GROUPIE (O.S.),"Ian! Ian turns and see a lovely GROUPIE, being blocked by the security guards. He waves her in, calls out:"
0,4,129,IAN,She's cool. Let her in.
0,4,130,RECORD EXEC,"Have some champagne, Chuck. You deserve it."
0,4,132,IAN,"Chill, baby brother."
0,4,135,MICHAEL (O.S.),Stop!
0,4,136,HURLEY,"What do you mean, ""stop,"" dude? Jack's in there --"
0,4,136,MICHAEL,"And if you remove that rock you might bring the whole cave ceiling down on top of him. Walt, get back, man. I don't want you near the rocks, okay? And take the dog with you --"
0,4,136,WALT MICHAEL,Why do I have to -- -- Just do it.
0,4,138,BOONE,How do you know so much about --
0,4,138,MICHAEL,Eight years of construction work.
0,4,143,SAYID,Something's coming --
0,4,144,KATE,What the hell are you doing here?
0,4,144,SAWYER,Easy. I just came to tell you something --
0,4,144,KATE,What makes you think I'm interested in anything you have to say to me?
0,4,145,SAWYER,Came to tell you... You were right. About me. That I don't help anyone
0,4,146,KATE,You're here to help?
0,4,146,SAWYER,"Hey -- You act any more surprised, I'm gonna be insulted."
0,4,148,LOCKE (O.S.),"Something wrong, Charlie?"
0,4,149,CHARLIE,Yeah. Jack. He's... There's been an accident... At the caves... Jack's buried in a cave-in...
0,4,150,LOCKE,Is anyone trying to get him out?
0,4,150,CHARLIE,Yeah -- Bunch of people there now.
0,4,150,LOCKE,"And why aren't you with them? You didn't come to tell me about Jack, did you?"
0,4,151,CHARLIE,"I want my stash, Locke. I can't stand... feeling like this."
0,4,152,LOCKE,Let me show you something...
0,4,154,CHARLIE,"I dunno. Butterfly, I guess."
0,4,154,LOCKE,No. It's much more beautiful than that. This is a moth cocoon. Ironic. Butterflies get all the
0,4,154,CHARLIE,Yeah. Wonderful. What's the --
0,4,155,LOCKE,"See this tiny hole? This moth's almost ready to emerge. It's in there right now, struggling, digging its way through the thick hide of the cocoon. Now I could help it, take my knife, gently widen the opening... And the moth would be free. But it'd be too weak to survive. The struggle is nature's way of strengthening it..."
0,4,161,CHARLIE,Hello?
0,4,163,JACK,"Where'd you do, Charlie?"
0,4,163,CHARLIE,"Wha-- Nowhere. I mean, I went for help. For you... But I was... I... I got lost... What are you wearing...?"
0,4,164,JACK,"You've seen me in this before, Choir Boy. You were supposed to look out for me, Charlie. But you left me to die in a hole."
0,4,165,CHARLIE,"How'd you get out of the cave, Jack?"
0,4,166,JACK,"Don't you get it, rock god? I'M"
0,4,166,STILL THERE!,
0,4,170,HURLEY (O.S.),We're through! We got a hole! Jack! Can you hear me? JACK!
0,4,172,JACK,H-Hurley?
0,4,172,HURLEY (O.S.),I hear him.
0,4,175,JACK,I'm... I'm pinned. I can't move... Charlie. Charlie was with me --
0,4,175,HURLEY (O.S.),"He's okay, man. He made it out. Listen, we're gonna get you out of there. Just sit tight."
0,4,176,SAYID,This is far enough. We'll place the second antenna here.
0,4,178,SAWYER,"Golly, thanks!"
0,4,179,SAYID,Five o'clock. Watch for my flare. Then it's your turn.
0,4,181,KATE,Who does?
0,4,181,SAYID,"I do not trust him with you. Kate looks at Sayid. Then, smiles at him, fondly."
0,4,181,KATE,I can handle him.
0,4,182,MICHAEL,Okay. We can't safely make the tunnel any bigger. But since Jack can't get out... One of us is gonna have to go in.
0,4,182,HURLEY,What? Crawl through that?
0,4,182,BOONE,I think he means someone smaller.
0,4,183,SUN JIN,I could climb through -- -- I forbid it! I will not permit you to use my wife for such a dangerous--
0,4,183,HURLEY,Dude! We don't understand Chinese.
0,4,183,MICHAEL,"Korean, man. They're Korean."
0,4,184,CHARLIE (O.S.),"I'll do it. They all turn to see -- CHARLIE, standing behind them. And he looks like hell -- but with something that resembles COURAGE... weather he got it from the drugs or not."
0,4,184,HURLEY,Charlie?
0,4,184,MICHAEL,"No, man. You're still shook up. I might be able to squeeze through --"
0,4,184,CHARLIE,Yeah? Who's gonna look after your kid if something happens? And you've got your sister. She's got a husband. I got no one. No family. I'm alone here. And I'm small. Let me do this.
0,4,185,SAWYER,Still ain't five. Just like the last time you checked your watch.
0,4,185,KATE,"I just don't want to miss Sayid's signal. Remember, I'll fire the flare, you switch on the antenna."
0,4,185,SAWYER,Thank the good Lord I got you here to keep reminding me.
0,4,187,KATE,"Do you try to be a pig, or does it just come naturally?"
0,4,187,SAWYER,"It's that he's a doctor, right? Ladies always dig the doctors. Hell -- Give me a couple band-aids, bottle of Peroxide and I could run this island, too --"
0,4,187,KATE,You're actually comparing yourself to Jack?
0,4,187,SAWYER,"Difference between us ain't all that big, sweetheart. I guarantee if he'd survived a few more weeks on the island, you'd have figured it out --"
0,4,187,KATE,"What did you just say? Sawyer looks at her, unsure what she means."
0,4,189,SAWYER,Aw... damn. Didn't I tell you? Word from the valley is Saint Jack got himself buried in a cave-in...
0,4,189,KATE,What?!
0,4,189,SAWYER,"Hey, look at the bright side... Now you got someone else to pity."
0,4,192,MICHAEL,"Go slow and easy, man. Try not to nudge any of the rocks around you."
0,4,192,CHARLIE,Anything else?
0,4,192,MICHAEL,Yeah. Good luck.
0,4,192,BOONE HURLEY,"Be safe, man -- -- Good luck, Charlie."
0,4,193,CHARLIE,Thanks.
0,4,196,CHARLIE,Bloody hell.
0,4,197,IAN,Hey... Baby Brother... Pull up a bird and sit down...
0,4,197,CHARLIE,"Get out. All of you, get out!"
0,4,199,NOW.,The Groupies exit sloppily. When the last one disappears --
0,4,200,IAN,"Ooh, a show. I like shows."
0,4,200,CHARLIE,"All right, Ian. This is it... After tonight, we cancel the rest of the tour. We're walking away."
0,4,200,IAN,What?
0,4,200,CHARLIE IAN,Walk away. Like we swore we'd do if things got too -- -- Are you raving? Walk away and go where?
0,4,200,CHARLIE,You're killing yourself with this junk. You're destroying Drive Shaft --
0,4,200,IAN,I am Drive Shaft!
0,4,206,MICHAEL HURLEY,Oh no -- -- What?
0,4,206,MICHAEL,
0,4,208,CHARLIE,"I'm, uh... here to rescue you."
0,4,209,HURLEY BOONE,I say we try again -- -- We can't just leave them --
0,4,209,HURLEY MICHAEL,-- We don't move they're gonna run out of air -- -- Stop talking! I'm trying to think --
0,4,209,KATE (O.S.),"Where is he?! They turn to see KATE running up to them, out of breath --"
0,4,209,MICHAEL KATE,"Kate -- Where is he, Michael? Where's Jack?"
0,4,209,HURLEY,In there.
0,4,209,KATE,Do you know if he's alive? Is he ALIVE?
0,4,209,MICHAEL,We don't know. Charlie went in after him. Through a tunnel we dug. But it... collapsed.
0,4,209,KATE,So why isn't anyone digging?
0,4,209,MICHAEL,Kate -- There's nothing left to dig to.
0,4,212,CHARLIE,You ready?
0,4,216,JACK CHARLIE,My shoulder's dislocated! -- What? -- You're gonna have to pop it back -- -- No... I... I can't --
0,4,218,JACK,"Yes, you can."
0,4,219,CHARLIE,Okay. So what do I do?
0,4,219,JACK,Grab my hand... Pull as hard as you can when I tell you.
0,4,223,IAN,Charlie? What are you doing here?
0,4,223,CHARLIE,"What, a bloke can't pay his big brother a visit once in a while?"
0,4,224,IAN,"`Course you can! Why didn't you call, you lunatic? Get in here. What are you doing in Sydney?"
0,4,224,CHARLIE (O.S.),"It's all lined up, Ian..."
0,4,226,IAN,Charlie... I don't want to come back.
0,4,227,CHARLIE,"Yeah. Well... Here's the thing... They won't book ""Drive Shaft"" without you...So, I'm asking you as a BROTHER -- the way you asked me --"
0,4,227,IAN,"Charlie, it's taken me a long time to clean up. I can't go back to --"
0,4,230,CHARLIE IAN,"Don't change the bloody subject -- -- You said you'd get help, man -- -- You gonna do this bloody tour with us or -- -- That's why you haven't been returning my calls... -- I lost your sodding number, okay? -- You're still a junkie --"
0,4,230,CHARLIE,"Well... you did this to me! A LONG BEAT, as Ian stares at him. Then, SYMPATHETICALLY..."
0,4,230,IAN,Listen. Why don't you stay with us for a few weeks? Karen and me... We can get you help. Sydney's got some really good programs--
0,4,230,CHARLIE,Forget it.
0,4,231,IAN,Don't go --
0,4,231,CHARLIE,"Thanks for helping, brother."
0,4,231,IAN,"Charlie... stay. Please. CLOSE ON CHARLIE, tracking back with him. Ian in the background, calling after him."
0,4,232,CHARLIE,You NEVER -- I've got a plane to catch.
0,4,234,JACK,"How long's it been, Charlie?"
0,4,235,CHARLIE,Don't know what you're talking about --
0,4,235,JACK,"How long since your last fix? Charlie looks at him, too fucking worn down to deny it..."
0,4,235,CHARLIE,Almost a day and a half now.
0,4,236,JACK,How's the withdrawal treating you? Any hallucinations?
0,4,236,CHARLIE,"Other than the conversation you and I had in the jungle about an hour ago, no, not really. You have a wonderful falsetto, by the way."
0,4,236,JACK,"Why didn't you say something, man? I could've helped you through it."
0,4,236,CHARLIE,"Yeah -- You thinking I'm not only useless, but a junkie to boot."
0,4,236,JACK,"You're not useless. Took a lot of guts getting in here, trying to rescue me. I won't forget that. Charlie and Jack share a look. Charlie manages a smile."
0,4,236,CHARLIE,For the rest of our lives?
0,4,236,JACK,At the rate we're using up the oxygen in here? Yeah... that won't be too long.
0,4,238,CHARLIE,There's a moth.
0,4,238,JACK,A what?
0,4,238,CHARLIE,Right there. Behind you. It's... There's a bloody moth in here.
0,4,240,JACK CHARLIE,Charlie! What are you --? -- Light! I can see light!
0,4,242,MICHAEL,Kate... You need to take a break...
0,4,242,KATE,I'm... fine...
0,4,242,MICHAEL,"We have enough people digging. You keep going at this pace, you're gonna kill yourself..."
0,4,243,WALT (O.S.),"Hey! It's the doctor! KATE and MICHAEL turn, as does everyone else. Walt is pointing EXCITEDLY across the valley at --"
0,4,244,HURLEY,What the--
0,4,246,JACK,Ow! Easy...
0,4,247,HURLEY,How did you get out?
0,4,247,JACK,Charlie found a way.
0,4,248,HURLEY,"Dude. You rock. And as we pull away from the joyous group, WE FIND..."
0,4,250,SAYID,"Alright, everyone. It's your turn."
0,4,251,SHANNON,"...Malibu most of the year, but the guys there are such idiots..."
0,4,251,BETH,"Hey, what's that? Fireworks?"
0,4,252,SHANNON,"Oh, dammit, dammit, dammit --"
0,4,253,SAYID,"Come on, Kate. One more..."
0,4,260,HURLEY,Dude. You feeling okay? You look a little...
0,4,260,JACK,Flu. He's got the flu.
0,4,261,HURLEY,"Oh, man. That's rough. After all you've been through... Fightin' a flu bug..."
0,4,264,CHARLIE,I'm just gonna... stretch my legs.
0,4,266,WALT,This place is so cool. Can we live here?
0,4,269,MICHAEL,"We'll, uh... talk about it, pal..."
0,4,270,CHARLIE (O.S.),"Give them to me. Locke looks up to see Charlie, and gives a heavy sigh."
0,4,270,LOCKE,"This is the third time, you know. Are you sure you really want --"
0,4,270,CHARLIE,"I'm sure. Locke nods, pulls the baggie of powder from his pocket. Hands it to Charlie. Charlie regards the grimy bag in his hand -- THEN TOSSES IT INTO LOCKE'S FIRE."
0,4,271,LOCKE,"I'm proud of you, Charlie. Always knew you could do it. Charlie nods, then suddenly notices..."
0,4,272,KATE (O.S.),Hey --
0,4,275,JACK,Ohh. My very first sling.
0,4,278,KATE,So... These are the safe caves you were going on about.
0,4,278,JACK,"Okay, one unsafe cave in this whole valley."
0,4,278,KATE,That you know of.
0,4,279,JACK,Does that mean you're going back to the beach?
0,4,279,KATE,Sayid should be back there by now. If his plan worked...
0,4,279,JACK,Then we're one step closer to getting off this island.
0,4,281,KATE,You're welcome.
0,4,284,SAYID,No...
