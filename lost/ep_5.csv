0,5,6,SAWYER (O.S.),"Helluva book. Kate stiffens, turns to the WATER. Finds SAWYER, bare- chested as he wades back to land. Smiles --"
0,5,6,SAWYER (CONT'D),It's about bunnies.
0,5,9,KATE,"Water's cold, huh?"
0,5,10,SAWYER,You bet. How `bout you come a little closer and warm me up?
0,5,11,KATE,Does this ever actually work?
0,5,11,SAWYER,"Depends on what you mean by ""this?"""
0,5,12,KATE,"This. This macho... -- ""Macho?"" Ain't heard that one in awhile. Makes me wanna grow a mustache."
0,5,13,KATE,"You sure know how to make a girl feel special, Sawyer."
0,5,14,"OH YEAH, BABY, YEAH--!!!","-- a SILHOUETTED COUPLE in the throes of passion: it's SAWYER and JESSICA , as attractive as she is acrobatic --"
0,5,16,JESSICA,...boy oh boy...
0,5,16,SAWYER,...Boy oh boy is right...
0,5,17,SAWYER (CONT'D),...look at you. What do you want? Right now.
0,5,19,JESSICA,How could I want anything else...?
0,5,20,JESSICA (CONT'D) SAWYER,"Uh-oh, Baby-- What?"
0,5,20,JESSICA (CONT'D) SAWYER,"I thought you had a meeting-- Yeah, it's not until six- thirty--"
0,5,20,JESSICA (CONT'D),"Baby, it's six-twenty-eight."
0,5,21,SAWYER,"Are you --? Oh, damnit -- damnit -- Honey, listen to me--"
0,5,22,JESSICA,"Go, you go, I'll stay here, watch TV, order room service, get fat--"
0,5,23,SAWYER,You order a chocolate sundae. When I get back I'll use you as a dish.
0,5,25,SAWYER (CONT'D),"...You, uh... weren't exactly supposed to see that."
0,5,29,SAWYER,"What're you doing in my stuff, son?"
0,5,31,JACK (O.S.),This is gonna hurt.
0,5,32,SAYID,I can do this myself...
0,5,32,JACK,You ready to tell me what happened?
0,5,33,SAYID,"We were trying to triangulate the transmission. The French woman. I saw the flare from the beach -- Then the flare from Sawyer's position in the jungle. I turned on my antenna, activated the transceiver, then -- darkness. Whoever hit me came from behind."
0,5,34,JACK,They destroyed the equipment?
0,5,34,SAYID,Yes.
0,5,34,JACK SAYID,Any idea who it...? -- A coward.
0,5,34,JACK,"We'll figure this out, man. Don't do anything that... And when Sayid looks at Jack, there is an ANGER -- a FIRE that we have not seen in his eyes before."
0,5,34,SAYID,I will do what I need to do to find the man responsible.
0,5,35,WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.),Where's the doctor?! Help us! Please!!!
0,5,38,JACK,Who did this to you?
0,5,39,RICHARD,Sawyer. And OFF JACK --
0,5,41,RICHARD,I'm fine. It's just a scrape.
0,5,41,JACK,Lots of scrapes today. I'm running out of peroxide.
0,5,41,RICHARD,I should've been able to take him. Sonofabitch fights dirty.
0,5,41,JACK,"-- yeah, I've seen that -- so you wanna tell me what happened?"
0,5,42,RICHARD,"Marybeth's - my wife's - asthma. I packed a few inhalers for our trip. Marybeth said put them in my carry-on, but I said - hey - vacation's over, we're on the plane, she can't need more than the one - right? The one ran out yesterday. So I'm scouring the wreckage - Marybeth's freaking - and then I see that bastard Sawyer just sitting there reading ""Watership Down."""
0,5,42,JACK,You're losing me...
0,5,42,RICHARD,"""Watership Down."" It's a book. It was in our luggage -- the stuff we checked. Looked for the last week, but we couldn't find it. If he's got my book, then he's got my suitcase. He's got my suitcase, he's got the inhalers. If she has an attack..."
0,5,44,RICHARD (CONT'D),"It'll be bad, man."
0,5,46,CHARLIE (O.S.),Morning delivery!
0,5,47,CLAIRE,You're sweet.
0,5,47,CHARLIE,"Figured in your condition, y'know with the extra ""baggage""..."
0,5,47,CLAIRE,"I can still walk, you know."
0,5,47,CHARLIE,"Barely. Anyway, I worry about you. Out here. It's very... sunny."
0,5,47,CLAIRE,Thus my hat.
0,5,47,CHARLIE,"Right. Hat. Sun hat. Brilliant. Lots of hats at the caves. And hey -- we've got a doctor, too. That'll come in handy, eh?"
0,5,47,CLAIRE,"I like the beach, Charlie."
0,5,49,CHARLIE,Yeah. Who wouldn't want to spend their day with sand fleas?
0,5,49,CLAIRE,"I want to be here, Charlie. For when we get rescued."
0,5,49,CHARLIE,"Right. For when we get rescued. And OFF CHARLIE, knowing full well that ain't gonna happen..."
0,5,52,SAWYER,"Hey, Doc. Long time, no see."
0,5,52,JACK,Where is it?
0,5,52,SAWYER,Where's what?
0,5,52,JACK,The woman's asthma medication. Her inhalers.
0,5,52,SAWYER,Oh. That.
0,5,52,JACK,You attacked a man because he was trying to help his sick wife.
0,5,53,SAWYER,No -- I whooped a thief `cause he was going through my stuff--
0,5,53,JACK,"Yours? What makes it yours, man? You think because you take it out of a suitcase --"
0,5,53,SAWYER,"Look -- I don't know what kinda Commie sharefest you're runnin' over in Cave Town -- but down here, possession's nine tenths and a man's got a right to protect his property."
0,5,54,JACK,Get up.
0,5,54,SAWYER,Why? You wanna see who's taller?
0,5,54,JACK,Get. Up.
0,5,54,SAWYER,"You sure you wanna make this your problem, Doc?"
0,5,54,JACK,"Yeah. I'm sure. And so, Sawyer gets up. Jack takes a step toward him -- so ready to fucking rumble that he misses the arrival of --"
0,5,54,KATE (O.S.),What's going on.
0,5,55,SAWYER,We were just exchangin' recipes.
0,5,57,SAWYER (CONT'D),"Sorry we couldn't work things out, Doc."
0,5,58,JESSICA (O.S.) SAWYER (O.S.),"You told me you were going to I am -- Jess, this isn't Baton Rouge to close a deal -- exactly the kind of thing you said it was ""too boring that's easy to describe-- to explain""--"
0,5,59,SAWYER,"Just trust me. There isn't time to explain. I'm already late and if I don't make this meeting, this whole thing's a bust, all right?"
0,5,60,SAWYER (CONT'D),Ever heard of Incentive Law?
0,5,61,SAWYER (CONT'D),Encourages foreign business here in New Orleans -- Tax breaks. Shared investments. The government sets up these private funds. To supplement foreign trade.
0,5,61,JESSICA,Do I need an Economics degree to understand why you have a suitcase full of cash?
0,5,62,SAWYER,You're looking at everything. Everything I got. Hundred and forty thousand dollars.
0,5,63,SAWYER (CONT'D),"There's an oil mining operation in the Gulf of Mexico -- drilling platforms. Three-hundred thousand dollars buys you one share. But as soon as you make that investment, that fund kicks in and triples your investment in two weeks. Triples it."
0,5,63,JESSICA,Three-hundred thousand. You got a hundred and forty.
0,5,63,SAWYER,"That would explain my meeting, wouldn't it?"
0,5,63,JESSICA,You're meeting with someone who has the rest of the money?
0,5,63,SAWYER,"There's this Canadian guy, wants in fifty-fifty. Two weeks - we'll be splitting almost a million bucks. Is it shady? Yeah. A little. But I gotta. All right? I meet the Canuck and make this deal happen -- I can pay for a lot more hotel rooms, lemme tell you."
0,5,64,JESSICA,There's another option.
0,5,64,SAWYER,...what's that?
0,5,65,JESSICA,That you don't go to the meeting. That you stay here. That we make love again. And that I give you the hundred-and-sixty thousand. And we split it. Sawyer stares at her -- a smile creeping up on his face.
0,5,65,SAWYER,How the hell you gonna scare up a hundred-and-sixty thousand bucks?
0,5,66,JESSICA,My husband.
0,5,68,KATE,That won't get us the medicine.
0,5,68,JACK,Maybe not. But it'll feel good.
0,5,68,KATE,Okay. So what's stopping you? He thinks Jack looks at Kate -- SURPRISED. She's serious. about it. Shakes his head --
0,5,68,JACK,"We're not savages yet, Kate."
0,5,69,KATE JACK,Let me talk to Sawyer. -- What?
0,5,69,KATE,I can reason with him.
0,5,70,JACK,This guy doesn't know reason.
0,5,70,KATE,Maybe not. But my plan is still better than yours.
0,5,71,JACK,What makes you think he'll listen?
0,5,71,KATE,He says we have a connection.
0,5,72,JACK,Do you?
0,5,72,KATE,Please. And as we can't help but notice that wasn't exactly a denial...
0,5,73,SAYID (O.S.),Locke...
0,5,74,SAYID (CONT'D),Where were you last night? Last night. Around sunset.
0,5,75,LOCKE,"Oh, yes. You were attacked. Heard about that."
0,5,76,SAYID,And I heard you were in the jungle. Alone. Not terribly far from where it happened.
0,5,77,LOCKE,"Well, I'm afraid the only witness to my whereabouts is the boar I was skinning for our dinner."
0,5,78,LOCKE (CONT'D),You were attempting to boost the signal on the transceiver. Send out a distress call.
0,5,78,SAYID,More or less.
0,5,78,LOCKE,So it would seem whoever attacked you has reasons for not wanting to get off the island. Maybe someone who is... profiting from our current circumstances?
0,5,79,SAYID,Is there someone you're meaning in particular?
0,5,79,LOCKE,"Oh, you know who I'm meaning. And from what I've seen... you and Mr. Sawyer do share a certain animosity."
0,5,79,SAYID,"He has an alibi. Just before I was... struck... he set off a bottle rocket, a signal we'd worked out, two kilometers away... he could not have had the time to --"
0,5,80,LOCKE,Unless he'd found a way to time delay the fuse on his rocket.
0,5,81,SAYID,How could he possibly--
0,5,81,LOCKE,"Anyone with basic military training knows how to improvise a slow fuse. Use a cigarette. As Sayid loses himself in this thought, Locke reaches into his gear, pulls out a large KNIFE, and holds it out to Sayid."
0,5,81,LOCKE (CONT'D),In case there's a next time.
0,5,82,KATE (O.S.),"So what do you want? Sawyer glances to see KATE, but just keeps on chopping:"
0,5,82,SAWYER,`Scuse me?
0,5,82,KATE,"What do you want, Sawyer?"
0,5,82,SAWYER,"Freckles, I got so many answers to that question I wouldn't even know where to start."
0,5,82,KATE,What do you want for the inhalers?
0,5,83,SAWYER,Huh. Good question. Hang on a tick. What do I want?
0,5,84,SAWYER (CONT'D),A kiss ought to do it.
0,5,84,KATE,What?
0,5,84,SAWYER,"A kiss. From you. Right now. Kate just stares. He can't possibly... but he stares back. Yeah. He's serious. Kate shakes her head, ANGRY now --"
0,5,84,KATE SAWYER,I don't buy it. -- Buy what?
0,5,84,KATE,"The act. You try too hard, Sawyer. I ask you to help a sick woman and you want me to kiss you? No one can be that disgusting."
0,5,85,KATE (CONT'D),"I've seen you, y'know."
0,5,85,SAWYER,Seen me what?
0,5,85,KATE,With that piece of paper. The one you keep in your wallet. I've seen your face when you read it. And the way you fold it up so carefully. It means something to you. So play your games all you want -- but I know there's a human being in there somewhere. Give me the medication. Please.
0,5,87,SAWYER,You think you understand me?
0,5,87,KATE SAWYER,Yeah. I think I -- -- Shut up.
0,5,88,SAWYER (CONT'D),Wanna know what kind of human being I am? And he reaches into his pocket. Removes the ENVELOPE.
0,5,88,SAWYER (CONT'D),Read it.
0,5,89,SAWYER (CONT'D),"Read it. He lets go of her, but doesn't step back. Let there be no misunderstanding here -- Kate better fucking do what he says."
0,5,90,KATE,"""Dear Mr. Sawyer. You don't know who I am. But I know who you are. And I know what you done. You slept with my mother... And then you stole my dad's money all away. So he got angry and he killed my mother. And then he killed himself, too."""
0,5,90,SAWYER,Don't stop now. You're gettin' to the good part.
0,5,92,KATE,"""All I know is your name. But one of these days I am gonna find you and I am going to give you this letter so you'll remember what you done to me. You killed my parents, Mr. Sawyer."""
0,5,94,SAWYER,
0,5,96,SAWYER (CONT'D),
0,5,100,JACK,You need to try to relax. How often do you get these attacks?
0,5,100,MARYBETH,At home... maybe once a week...
0,5,100,RICHARD,She's been getting them almost every day since the crash.
0,5,101,JACK,"Marybeth. Just hang in there, okay? I'll get you through this."
0,5,102,SUN,That woman... She's very ill.
0,5,102,JIN,The doctor is taking care of her.
0,5,102,SUN,I think I can help her.
0,5,102,JIN,Leave it to the doctor. This is not our problem.
0,5,102,SUN JIN,But-- -- Let it go.
0,5,107,JACK,What are you doing here?
0,5,107,SAWYER,Getting water. That a problem?
0,5,107,JACK,Give me the inhalers. Now.
0,5,107,SAWYER,Hell -- I was wonderin' when you were gonna stop asking nice.
0,5,109,SAWYER (CONT'D),"Well it's about time, cowboy. Didn't think you had it in... Sawyer's head whips around... WHAM! Jack POUNDS HIM again. drops to ONE KNEE."
0,5,118,DAVID (PRE-LAP),The money comes from -- what?
0,5,119,SAWYER,"Incentives from a foreign investment. Listen -- David, I'm not sure this is a good idea--"
0,5,119,JESSICA,Why not?
0,5,119,SAWYER,"`Cause business between friends is always a little sticky. I don't know you well, but I know your wife. Working with her at the bank, I'm not sure I'm comfortable--"
0,5,119,DAVID,-- Louisiana will invest two-thirds of the drilling cost? What is this... a loophole?
0,5,120,SAWYER,"Look, David -- you're reluctant and I get it. You got your car dealership, you don't need this--"
0,5,120,JESSICA DAVID,"We should do this -- -- Jess, I don't even know this guy--"
0,5,120,JESSICA,Show him the cash.
0,5,120,DAVID,You have it with you?
0,5,121,DAVID (CONT'D),...How do I know this is real?
0,5,121,SAWYER,"The money? Hell -- -- Take it, check it out, I don't care. I know where your wife works, you aren't going anywhere."
0,5,122,SAWYER (CONT'D),"Listen. Don't worry, I got other investors lined up --"
0,5,122,JESSICA,-- David--
0,5,122,SAWYER,Great to meet you -- -- And I'll see you Monday.
0,5,124,DAVID,Wait!
0,5,125,DAVID (CONT'D),You said we could... take the money... check it out?
0,5,125,SAWYER,I need to know in twenty-four hours. You're in? Great. You're out. Great.
0,5,128,CLAIRE,"Warm, clean towels. Like when they first come out of the dryer. Your turn."
0,5,128,CHARLIE,Banoffi pie.
0,5,128,CLAIRE,You said that already.
0,5,128,CHARLIE,The toffee and cream. And crumbled biscuits.
0,5,128,CLAIRE,Is food the only thing you miss?
0,5,129,CHARLIE,"Forgive me if the practicality of a clean towel eludes me. For God's sake, you're a pregnant woman! Don't you crave anything? Pickles? Ice Cream? Fried Chocolate -"
0,5,129,CLAIRE,- Peanut butter. I'm the only Australian who loves peanut butter.
0,5,130,CHARLIE,I can get you peanut butter.
0,5,130,CLAIRE,Right. Sure you can.
0,5,130,CHARLIE,"Indeed... and when I provide you with your revered peanut butter, you must vacate this sandy strip of depression and move to the caves. Deal?"
0,5,131,CLAIRE,You're on.
0,5,134,RICHARD (CONT'D),It's an attack -- she needs her...
0,5,136,JACK,"Marybeth? Listen to me. Look at me, okay?"
0,5,137,JACK (CONT'D),You need to listen now. This isn't just your asthma. It's anxiety. It's in your head.
0,5,137,MARYBETH,
0,5,137,JACK,"You know you're out of medicine, so you're panicking. But we can fight this. Together. Okay? Nod your head, Marybeth."
0,5,138,JACK (CONT'D),Breathe in through your nose. Slowly.
0,5,139,JACK (CONT'D),No. Through the nose. Like this.
0,5,140,JACK (CONT'D),"Now hold one of my arms and squeeze as hard as you can. Squeeze my arm, Marybeth. Harder. She digs her fingernails into his forearm. Practically draws blood. But Jack can't feel it."
0,5,141,JACK (CONT'D),Good. Good. Now again... In through the nose.
0,5,142,JACK (CONT'D),Don't look at him. Look at me! In through the nose. Slow. Now -- loosen your grip. Let go...
0,5,143,JACK (CONT'D),Okay. You're getting air. Your color's coming back.
0,5,144,JACK (CONT'D),See? I knew you could do this. It's passing. Can you feel it?
0,5,144,MARYBETH,Yes.
0,5,144,JACK,Now. Again.
0,5,145,JACK (CONT'D),Try to get her to sleep.
0,5,146,HURLEY,"Wow, man. That was awesome. That was like a... Jedi moment."
0,5,147,SAYID,What will happen if she doesn't get her medicine?
0,5,149,SAYID (CONT'D),Then we must make Sawyer hand it over.
0,5,149,JACK,That's what I'm gonna do--
0,5,150,JACK,I thought you were a communications officer.
0,5,151,SAYID,Yes. And part of my training entailed getting the enemy to communicate.
0,5,152,SAYID (CONT'D),"Give me ten minutes with him. He'll give us the medicine. Yes? ON JACK -- wrestling with his ethics. Seconds hand like hours -- until he finally looks hard at Sayid and says, firmly:"
0,5,152,JACK,Yes.
0,5,155,SAYID,Good morning.
0,5,158,KATE,What are you doing?
0,5,158,SAYID,We're solving a problem. Do not concern yourself.
0,5,158,KATE,You're going to torture him?
0,5,159,KATE (CONT'D),Jack -- if you do this... You're no better than he is.
0,5,159,JACK,This was his choice. Not mine.
0,5,162,MICHAEL,Damn stupid --
0,5,162,SUN,Michael?
0,5,163,MICHAEL,Oh. Hey.
0,5,164,SUN,The sick woman...
0,5,165,MICHAEL,Yeah. Asthma.
0,5,165,SUN,Yes. Asthma. I think I can help her.
0,5,166,HURLEY,"All the food from the plane's been gone over a week, dude."
0,5,166,CHARLIE,"No secret stash for ""emergencies?"" You and Jack have all sorts of crap in that cave..."
0,5,166,HURLEY,"Sorry, man. There's no peanut butter, no peanuts, no nothing."
0,5,166,CHARLIE,There's got to be something. I mean -- look at you...
0,5,168,HURLEY CHARLIE,"Look at what? -- Nonono, listen--"
0,5,168,HURLEY,Fat guy hoarding the food. That what you think?
0,5,169,CHARLIE,"--Well no, that's not what I think-- no -- I... we have been here two weeks and you haven't really, uh..."
0,5,169,HURLEY,Slimmed down much?
0,5,169,CHARLIE,All I need's a bag of peanuts---
0,5,169,HURLEY,"I have no food, okay? And for that record, I'm down a notch on my belt! All right? I'm a big guy, okay? It'll probably be a while before you'll wanna give me a piggyback ride."
0,5,170,CHARLIE,Sorry. I shouldn't've... Bad form.
0,5,170,HURLEY,Yeah. I'm used to it.
0,5,171,CHARLIE,"So, not even a single bag of...?"
0,5,171,HURLEY,Dude.
0,5,171,CHARLIE,Okay. Sorry.
0,5,176,SAWYER,"Well, ain't you the brave one? Jumping a guy when he's nappin'--"
0,5,177,SAWYER (CONT'D),"Huh. Well now we got ourselves a party. Couple more fellas, we can deal a little stud."
0,5,179,SAWYER (CONT'D),"Uh oh. I'm in trouble, ain't I?"
0,5,179,JACK,"We gave you every chance to do the right thing, Sawyer. All we wanted was the asthma medicine. Just tell me where your stash is. Where the medicine is. And we'll stop."
0,5,179,SAWYER,"Stop what, Chico? SNAP! Jack looks over as Sayid breaks off another piece of BAMBOO. Turns back to Sawyer --"
0,5,179,JACK,It doesn't have to be this way.
0,5,181,SAWYER,Yeah. It does.
0,5,183,SAYID,"We do not have bamboo in Iraq, though we have something similar. Reeds. But their effect is the same when the chutes are inserted under the fingernails."
0,5,184,SAWYER,"Know what I think, Ali? I think you've never actually tortured anybody in your life."
0,5,190,SAWYER,That's it? S'all you got? Splinters? No wonder we kicked your ass in the Gulf War.
0,5,194,JACK,Sayid...
0,5,195,JACK (CONT'D),Let him catch his breath.
0,5,196,SAWYER,Don't... Don't stop now... Think my sinuses are finally clearin'... And Jack's had enough -- lunges at Sawyer -- GRABS his head and holds it face to face with him as he demands:
0,5,196,JACK,What the hell is wrong with you?! Why are you making us do this?! Just tell us where the medicine is.
0,5,196,SAWYER,More bamboo! Let's go! C'mon!
0,5,196,SAYID,Enough of this --
0,5,198,SAYID (CONT'D),Perhaps losing an eye will loosen your tongue...
0,5,198,SAWYER JACK,"Man, you're just a big, walking cliche, ain't you? -- Sayid, this isn't--"
0,5,199,SAWYER,"Okay! Okay, you win. Sayid holds the knife steady --"
0,5,199,SAYID,Where is it?
0,5,200,SAWYER,Only person I'll tell -- Is her.
0,5,201,JACK,...Kate?
0,5,201,SAYID,He's stalling...
0,5,201,SAWYER,That's the deal. Take it or leave it.
0,5,202,KILEY (PRE-LAP),"Tell me, Sawyer - do you want to die?"
0,5,205,KILEY,"`Cause when a man walks into my place and tells me he left a hundred and sixty thousand of my hard-won dollars in the care of a civilian, I gotta ask myself if what I'm hearing isn't a desperate cry for the sweet release of death."
0,5,206,SAWYER,"That's why you're an accountant and I'm a genius, Mr. Kiley."
0,5,207,SAWYER (CONT'D),"I closed a deal today. Big one. See, women are easy. A few cosmos and a couple of stunts they haven't seen between the sheets and they think the scam is their idea. The husbands -"
0,5,208,SAWYER (CONT'D),- They need to touch the money. Smell it. Believe that if they had the brass to put that suitcase in the trunk of their Ford Taurus and speed away they might just have a chance at being an honest-to-gosh outlaw. They need the rock-hard conviction that I handed them the chance to screw me.
0,5,209,SA WYER (CONT'D),"That kind of trust don't come cheap, but by the time Ken n' Barbie realize I blew out of town with their life savings, she'll be too ashamed to call the cops and be shown up as a whore and he'll be too afraid to call the cops and be shown up as a sap. Thing of beauty."
0,5,210,KILEY,"Okay, Tex -- You've got your grift so pat, what'd you need my money for? Where's your seed from the last couple you roped?"
0,5,210,SAWYER,What can I say? I like earning it as much as I like spending it.
0,5,210,KILEY,"No, Sawyer -- That's not why."
0,5,211,KILEY (CONT'D),"The reason you can't hold on to money is you aren't in it for money. You're in it to make people suffer, and in this ""accountant's"" mind, that makes you a liability."
0,5,212,SAWYER,"You got your baggage, I got mine."
0,5,212,KILEY,"Be that as it may, I know a thing or two about making people suffer myself... You have my money -- plus fifty percent by noon tomorrow -- and I'll tell you all about it."
0,5,216,JACK,"What's your problem, Sawyer? And that just hangs there for a few moments. And we're anticipating Sawyer's response when -- NOISE from the surrounding jungle. Jack turns to see -- SAYID returning. Behind him, KATE. And as soon as she sees Sawyer tied up like an animal -- no matter what she thinks of the guy -- There's a flash of VULNERABILITY."
0,5,216,SAYID,Okay. She's here. Now tell us.
0,5,216,SAWYER,Uh uh. No. I want to talk to her alone.
0,5,217,SAYID,You are through making requests...
0,5,217,KATE,Stop. I'll be okay. Just go. Let's get this over with.
0,5,217,SAWYER,You heard the lady. Scram.
0,5,218,KATE,Jack -- I've got it.
0,5,220,JACK,We'll be close.
0,5,223,KATE,What did they do to you?
0,5,223,SAWYER,Nothin'. Just got a manicure.
0,5,223,KATE,So I'm here. Where is it?
0,5,223,SAWYER,Happy to tell you... Soon as I get that kiss.
0,5,223,KATE,What? -- Are you serious?
0,5,223,SAWYER,"Baby, I'm tied to tree in the Jungle of Mystery and I just got tortured by a damn spinal surgeon and a genuine I-raqi. `Course I'm serious."
0,5,224,SAWYER (CONT'D),"You're not seeing the big picture here, Freckles. You really gonna let that woman suffocate `cause you can't bring yourself to give me a little kiss? Hell -- it's only first base... lucky for you I ain't greedy. I'm making it real simple here -- you wanna be a hero or not?"
0,5,227,KATE,Okay.
0,5,227,SAWYER,Okay.
0,5,232,SAWYER (CONT'D),I don't have it.
0,5,232,KATE,What?
0,5,232,SAWYER,The medicine. I don't have it. Never did.
0,5,233,KATE,Your book -- they said you got it out of their suitcase...
0,5,233,SAWYER,Went in the drink with the rest of the damn luggage from the tail. Book washed up on shore.
0,5,234,SA WYER (CONT'D),"Had to dry it out, but it's still a damn good read. You'd like --"
0,5,236,KATE,He doesn't have it.
0,5,236,JACK,What?
0,5,236,SAYID,He's lying. He...
0,5,236,KATE,No. He's not. Not about this.
0,5,247,SAYID JACK,-- He... he got loose -- attacked me -- -- You hit an artery -
0,5,248,KATE,Ohmygod...
0,5,250,JACK,"Stay still, dammit! Sawyer's fist clench around the earth - his fingernails digging into the ground as Jack does his grim duty -- SHIT -- Jack's hand -- already SOAKED with Sawyer's blood..."
0,5,250,KATE,Can you stop it?
0,5,254,RICHARD,Where's Jack? Is he with you?
0,5,255,RICHARD (CONT'D),He said he'd be back with my wife's medicine. He promised to -- You're bleeding.
0,5,256,SAYID,I'm... I'm very sorry. The doctor will be here as soon as he can.
0,5,257,MICHAEL,Hey!
0,5,258,MICHAEL (CONT'D),Are these the right ones? I think I got the right tree but --
0,5,259,SUN,Let me see.
0,5,260,SU N (CONT'D),Yes. Good. I need some... I need to boil --
0,5,261,JIN,What are you doing with him?
0,5,262,JIN (CONT'D),Why are you sneaking around with this man? What's going on? And there it is - Sun has no choice. Take the time to explain that she went behind Jin's back to help the sick lady or disobey again and save Marybeth's life.
0,5,265,MICHAEL,"Don't, man. Just. Don't."
0,5,269,SAWYER,Let go. Just -- leave it. -- I know you want to.
0,5,269,JACK,Shut up. Stop moving.
0,5,271,SAWYER,"You've been waiting for this, haven't you? Yeah -- I'll bet you have. You get to be a hero again `cause that's what you do. You fix everything up all nice. Tell him to let go, Freckles. We already made out -- what I got left to live for?"
0,5,272,SAWYER (CONT'D),"Hey, Jack? You should know something -- Right now? Tables were turned? I'd watch you die. And Sawyer barely manages a smile as his eyes finally CLOSE. And after a moment of COMPLETE DARKNESS --"
0,5,272,SAWYER,Allrighty. Looks like we're in the oil business.
0,5,273,DAVID,We're cool?
0,5,274,SAWYER,"Oh, we're cool. The fish has been hooked. David is most certainly IN. Yup."
0,5,274,DAVID SAWYER,We get the money back...? -- Week from tomorrow. Tripled.
0,5,275,DAVID,"You're not gonna skip town, are you?"
0,5,275,JESSICA,"David, for godssake -- He left all his money with us. We could've skipped town."
0,5,275,SAWYER,"You got a smart woman there, David. Don't let go of her. And that's when --"
0,5,275,CHILD'S VOICE (O.S.),Mommy?
0,5,277,JESSICA,"Hi, baby. What are you doing up?"
0,5,277,BOY,Will you read to me?
0,5,277,JESSICA,"In a minute, sweetheart. We have company right now."
0,5,279,DAVID,...You okay?
0,5,280,SAWYER,...Deal's off.
0,5,281,DAVID,Excuse me?
0,5,281,SAWYER,Deal's off. Forget it.
0,5,282,JESSICA DAVID,"What are you doing? -- Hold on -- You're not walking out of here, man..."
0,5,282,SAWYER (CONT'D),"I'm calling it off. Walking away. No harm, no foul."
0,5,283,DAVID,"Jessica, call the police."
0,5,283,SAWYER,"Take your hand off me, boy."
0,5,284,DAVID,"Call the police, Jessica! And this is going South real fucking fast -- TENSION -- Jessica not knowing what to do. Betrayed. Confused --"
0,5,284,JESSICA,Sawyer?
0,5,285,DAVID,What's going on here?
0,5,285,JESSICA DAVID,"This isn't how it's supposed to work! You said -- -- What he said? What'd he say, Jessica?"
0,5,286,BOY,Mommy?
0,5,293,KATE,You're lucky to be alive.
0,5,294,SAWYER,The doctor -- ?
0,5,294,KATE,Ignored you and saved your life anyway.
0,5,294,SAWYER,Where is he?
0,5,295,KATE,He headed back to the caves to check on that woman.
0,5,296,KATE (CONT'D),I read it again. And then again. Last couple hours -- I don't know how many times.
0,5,297,SAWYER,Why would you -- ?
0,5,297,KATE,"Because I'm trying to figure out why you made me read it. Why you beat up that man instead of just telling him you didn't have his wife's medication. Why you pretended to have it anyway. Why you let yourself get tortured. And the thing I kept coming up with was -- it was that you want to be hated. And maybe that's why you made me read this letter. ""You killed my parents, Mr. Sawyer."""
0,5,298,KATE (CONT'D),And then I looked at the envelope.
0,5,299,KATE (CONT'D),"""America's Bicentennial -- Knoxville Tennessee. 1976."""
0,5,301,KATE (CONT'D),"You were a kid in 1976. Eight, maybe nine years old."
0,5,301,SAWYER,-- Kate...
0,5,301,KATE,This letter wasn't written to you. You wrote this letter.
0,5,302,KATE (CONT'D),"Sawyer isn't your name, is it?"
0,5,303,SAWYER,...It was his name.
0,5,304,SAWYER (CONT'D),"First heard it at my momma's wake. My daddy didn't get one -- You don't get a wake when you kill yourself. Was my Uncle Doug who pulled me aside. Told me it was a confidence man who killed them. Told me how he rolled into town, marked my folks. Romanced my momma, used her to get to their money. Wiped `em out clean, left the mess behind. Only thing the cops had was his name on a bogus business card. So I wrote that letter. Wrote it knowing I'd find him one day. You want all the sad parts? `Cause I spent the next ten years getting passed off from one place to another. Lady from the State wrote me off -- ""adjustment problems."" Don't that just say it all?"
0,5,306,SAWYER (CONT'D),And then I was nineteen -- needed six grand to pay off some guys I was in trouble with. So I found a pretty lady with a dumb husband who had some money. And I got them to give it to me. How you like that for tragedy? Became the man I was hunting. Became Sawyer.
0,5,309,SAWYER (CONT'D),Don't you feel sorry for me...
0,5,309,KATE SAWYER,What? I... -- Get the hell out. Sawyer PULLS the letter from her hand. Kate surprised --
0,5,309,SAWYER (CONT'D),Get out.
0,5,315,RICHARD,
0,5,315,JACK,"Eucalyptus? Smart, Jack. Real smart."
0,5,316,JACK (CONT'D),Thank you. Very much.
0,5,319,CLAIRE,What... what're you doing?
0,5,319,CHARLIE,Packing your stuff.
0,5,321,CHARLIE (CONT'D),I'm guessing you'll be taking this with.
0,5,321,CLAIRE,Where?
0,5,321,CHARLIE,The caves. You're moving.
0,5,321,CLAIRE,You didn't -- Peanut butter? Charlie nods.
0,5,321,CLAIRE (CONT'D),No way.
0,5,321,CHARLIE,Just like you ordered.
0,5,322,CHARLIE (CONT'D),"There's one thing, though. It's extra smooth."
0,5,322,CLAIRE,"That's okay. And finally, Charlie produces... An EMPTY GLASS JAR."
0,5,322,CLAIRE (CONT'D),It's... it's empty.
0,5,323,CHARLIE,"What? No it's not. It's full, see? Full to the top with stick to the roof of your mouth, god, it makes you want a glass of milk so bad, extra smooth..."
0,5,325,CHARLIE (CONT'D),Best sodding peanut butter I've ever tasted. Want some?
0,5,326,CHARLIE (CONT'D),"Good, isn't it?"
0,5,327,CLAIRE,No. It's great.
0,5,327,CHARLIE,So... you'll be wanting this with you? In the caves?
0,5,328,KATE,Sayid?
0,5,329,SAYID,I can't be here.
0,5,329,KATE,What do you -- ?
0,5,329,SAYID,I'm going off.
0,5,329,KATE,...What?
0,5,330,SAYID,I'm leavin. I don't know for how long.
0,5,330,KATE,"Sayid, you can't -- we don't know what's out--"
0,5,330,SAYID,"-- What, it's too dangerous? No more than staying here. I have worse things to fear than what's in the jungle. What I did today - what I almost did... I swore never again. Never again. If I can't keep that promise, I have no right to be here."
0,5,330,KATE,But there's nowhere to go.
0,5,330,SAYID,"Someone has to walk the shore. Map the island. See what else there is. Find a means of escape. I can't think of a better person to do it then the only one I trust. Kate looks at Sayid - she knows better than to try to talk him out of it, so she merely nods -"
0,5,331,SAYID (CONT'D),I hope we meed again. Under... happier circumstances.
