0,6,12,SAWYER (O.S.),"Ow! -- Easy, jackass!"
0,6,13,JACK,"You want it easy, quit moaning. I've got to change these bandages --"
0,6,13,SAWYER,"Yeah, well, try not taking my skin off with `em."
0,6,13,JACK,Hold. Still.
0,6,14,SAWYER,"So, considerin' we pretty much hate each other, how'd I score the house call, Dr. Quinn? Tryin' to ease your conscience?"
0,6,15,JACK,"My conscience is fine, thanks."
0,6,15,SAWYER JACK,Yeah? -- Yeah.
0,6,15,SAWYER,`Course -- what you got to feel guilty about? You let that damn Arab torture me. Stood by and watched. So now you just patch me up and you get your ticket into heaven. Only reason you're here is...
0,6,15,JACK,I'm here -- Because no one else wants anything to do with you.
0,6,16,SAWYER,She does.
0,6,17,JACK,Change your own damn bandages.
0,6,20,JACK (O.S.),Looking for someone...?
0,6,21,JACK (CONT'D),-- Or just admiring the view?
0,6,22,KATE,"It's been two days, Jack."
0,6,22,JACK,What?
0,6,22,KATE,Two days since Sayid took off on his own. I keep thinking I'm gonna look up and see him coming back.
0,6,23,JACK,He'll come back when he finds what he's looking for. The French transmission...
0,6,23,KATE,He wasn't looking for anything -- He left because of what happened... because of what he did.
0,6,24,JACK,It was an accident --
0,6,24,KATE,"-- Yeah, well, accidents happen when you torture somebody, Jack."
0,6,26,KATE (CONT'D),I'm worried about him. He's out there. Alone.
0,6,26,JACK,"Sayid's a trained soldier, Kate. He can take care of himself."
0,6,31,SAYID,Ya Allah--
0,6,40,SHANNON,Ew -- Get him out of there!
0,6,40,WALT,What?
0,6,40,SHANNON,"The dog, Webster! It's drinking our water!"
0,6,40,MICHAEL (O.S.),Hey --
0,6,41,MICHAEL (CONT'D),Do not yell at my kid. What's the problem?
0,6,41,SHANNON,My problem? I walked all the way from the beach to get something to drink... and your animal's drooling in our water supply.
0,6,43,HURLEY,"Y'know, dogs' mouths are cleaner than humans'."
0,6,43,SHANNON,Nobody asked you.
0,6,44,SHANNON (CONT'D),Oh my God -- DO SOMETHING!
0,6,45,JACK,What's going on out there?
0,6,45,HURLEY,"Ah, you know, the usual... People yelling at each other over nothing."
0,6,45,SULLIVAN,"So, what do you think, Doc? This rash... It's bad, isn't it? Some kinda jungle disease... or--"
0,6,45,JACK,Hives.
0,6,45,SULLIVAN,"Hives. What is that, like, a poison ivy--"
0,6,45,JACK,"It's a common rash, Sullivan. Brought on by heat. And stress. Just try to relax. It'll clear up."
0,6,45,SULLIVAN,You sure? I mean... It really itches. And... burns a little.
0,6,45,SUN,It's ready.
0,6,47,JACK,Here. This should help with the itching. And the burning. Just... try to get your mind off it.
0,6,47,SULLIVAN,Uh... O-okay. Thanks.
0,6,48,HURLEY,"""Get your mind off it?"" What else is that dude gonna do but stress?"
0,6,48,JACK,I've got enough on my plate without having to treat hypochondriacs.
0,6,48,HURLEY,"That's, like, my point, man. We're all fried. I mean, have you taken a look at those people out there? Everybody's way tense... y'know, since we were in a plane crash? And Sayid splitting like that. Plus... we got, like, no real plan to get off this island..."
0,6,49,HURLEY (CONT'D),"I'm just saying... It'd be sweet to have something to, y'know... do."
0,6,49,JACK,"Look, I sympathize. But we're surviving. That's my main concern right now. Keeping us alive. Things could be worse."
0,6,50,HURLEY,How?
0,6,54,SAYID,There is no divinity except God. What God has willed must be --
0,6,55,SAYID (CONT'D),Hel--Hello?
0,6,61,FIGURE,Where is Alex?
0,6,61,SAYID,Wha-- What...?
0,6,62,FIGURE,Where is Alex?
0,6,63,SAYID,Who-- Who are you?
0,6,63,FIGURE,Where... is... Alex?
0,6,63,SAYID,
0,6,66,VOICE SAYID,Where is Alex? -- Please -- Listen to me... I don't know any Alex. I'm --
0,6,67,SAYID (CONT'D),
0,6,67,PRISONER (PRE-LAP),Stop...
0,6,68,PRISONER,Stop...
0,6,70,SAYID,"You want me to stop, Falah? Then start answering my questions, because I can do this all day..."
0,6,71,SAYID (CONT'D),I assure you we already know the truth. But I want you to admit it.
0,6,72,SAYID (CONT'D),...And all the pain will stop... Your Shi'ite friends have already implicated you in the bombing.
0,6,72,PRISONER,You're... you're lying. They would never --
0,6,74,PRISONER SAYID,I had nothing... nothing -- Confess it. And perhaps to... do... it will only cost you your hands instead of your life.
0,6,77,SAYID,He doesn't know anything. Your sources were wrong.
0,6,77,OMAR,"Perhaps. But that's really not the point, is it? You handled yourself well in there."
0,6,77,SAYID,Did I?
0,6,77,OMAR,"I'll put in for your reassignment to the Intelligence Division, if you still wish it."
0,6,78,SAYID,"Yes, sir. Very much so."
0,6,78,OMAR,"Good... But stop calling me ""sir"" when it's just the two of us."
0,6,78,SAYID,"You're my superior officer, Omar. For now. Enjoy it while you can."
0,6,79,OMAR,That reminds me... a promotion is commensurate with your move...
0,6,81,OMAR (O.S.) (CONT'D),"That is, if you won't miss being a Communications Officer."
0,6,81,SAYID,I'm willing to make that sacrifice.
0,6,85,ETHAN,Hi.
0,6,86,HURLEY,Yo. What's this?
0,6,87,LOCKE,These were in the jungle. Must have fallen from the plane.
0,6,87,HURLEY,Uh... What were you guys doing out in the jungle at night?
0,6,87,ETHAN,Best time to hunt.
0,6,87,LOCKE,Ethan here's got some experience...
0,6,88,LOCKE (CONT'D),Spotted tracks we think might be rabbit or some other rodent.
0,6,88,HURLEY,Rodent. Yum.
0,6,88,ETHAN,Figured people are starting to get tired of eating boar meat. Variety is the spice of life.
0,6,88,HURLEY,"Dude, you got that right. Okay. I'll check out the bags. See if there's anything useful we can... y'know... use. Thanks."
0,6,89,WALT (O.S.),Mr. Locke...
0,6,90,WALT (CONT'D),Are you going back out to hunt?
0,6,90,LOCKE,For a bit.
0,6,90,WALT,"Well... Can I go with you? I mean, I wanna learn how to... Y'know, hunt and--"
0,6,90,MICHAEL (O.S.),Walt -- !
0,6,92,WALT,I was just... I was talking to Mr. Locke about--
0,6,93,MICHAEL,"I know what you're doing, man. Not gonna happen. Get back to bed."
0,6,96,HURLEY,Oh... Duuude...
0,6,99,FIGURE SAYID,Where is Alex? -- I don't -- Please --
0,6,99,FIGURE,Where is Alex?
0,6,99,SAYID,-- PLEASE just listen... I'm-- I'm a survivor of a plane crash -- I found a wire at the beach... followed it... Thought it might have something to do with a transmission we picked up on out transceiver...
0,6,99,FIGURE,Transmission?
0,6,100,SAYID,A recording... a mayday -- a French woman... Repeating on a loop... for more than sixteen years...
0,6,101,FIGURE (O.S.),"""Si n'importe qui peut entendre ceci veullez nous aider... I' les a tues. Il les a tues tous..."""
0,6,102,FRENCH WOMAN,... sixteen years...? Has it really been that long?
0,6,103,SAYID,You...
0,6,104,FRENCH WOMAN,You just... happened to hear my distress call... Stumbled upon it... LIES! No planes fly over this island. I know what you are --
0,6,105,FRENCH WOMAN (CONT'D),You're one of them!
0,6,111,SAYID,"""Rousseau..."""
0,6,112,ROUSSEAU,How do you know my name?
0,6,112,SAYID,
0,6,113,SAYID (CONT'D),What is this place?
0,6,113,ROUSSEAU,Yes. What is this place?
0,6,117,SAYID,Those batteries... They wouldn't produce enough power to transmit your distress call all these years.
0,6,117,ROUSSEAU,The transmission. It broadcasts... from somewhere else. But they control it now...
0,6,117,SAYID,"""They...?"""
0,6,117,ROUSSEAU,You. And the others like you.
0,6,118,SAYID,
0,6,118,ROUSSEAU,"""Sayid."""
0,6,118,SAYID,What? How do you -- ?
0,6,118,ROUSSEAU,My name is on a jacket. Yours is on the envelope you carry. Who is she?
0,6,119,ROUSSEAU (CONT'D),The woman. In the photographs.
0,6,119,SAYID,That's -- She's no one...
0,6,119,ROUSSEAU,You carry photos of her. She means something to you. Who is she?
0,6,119,SAYID ROUSSEAU,I don't -- -- Tell me!
0,6,120,SAYID,Nadia. Her name is Nadia...
0,6,121,OMAR (O.S.),We can't tie her directly to the bombing...
0,6,122,OMAR (CONT'D),But we know where her sympathies lie. She's a known associate of Kurdish and Shi'ite insurgents.
0,6,122,SAYID,You think she knows who orchestrated the bombing.
0,6,122,OMAR,"That, my friend, is exactly what you will find out."
0,6,125,SAYID,"Noor Abed Jaseem... I'm going to ask you some questions... And if you refuse to cooperate, I am going to hurt you. Do you under--"
0,6,126,NADIA,"Nobody calls me ""Noor,"" Sayid. You of all people should know that."
0,6,127,NADIA (CONT'D),"What, you don't remember me? Am I so different from the little girl in the schoolyard who used to push you in the mud... send you crying home to your mother..."
0,6,128,SAYID,Nadia.
0,6,128,NADIA,"And your mother would tell my mother... And I would be in such trouble -- ""Why must you pick on little Sayid?"" and I'd answer: ""Because he ignores me."""
0,6,128,SAYID,You had enough attention. With your family's wealth. And your... charms.
0,6,128,NADIA,"Such things matter little to children. But then you were always older than your years, weren't you, Sayid?"
0,6,128,SAYID,Not old enough to understand that being pushed in the mud was a sign of affection.
0,6,129,SAYID (CONT'D),And now you're a traitor to your country.
0,6,130,NADIA,"Traitor... Saddam is the traitor. And you blindly serve him... like a dog. He's betrayed his own people, brutalized... murdered them --"
0,6,130,SAYID,Tell me what you know about the bombing in Najaf...
0,6,131,SAYID (CONT'D),You know who was behind it. Tell me -- or I swear I will hurt you.
0,6,132,NADIA,"Oh, I know, Sayid. This isn't my first interrogation by the Republican Guard..."
0,6,133,NADIA (CONT'D),This is where they burned me with acid... When I couldn't tell them the whereabouts of a man I'd met only in passing...
0,6,134,NADIA (CONT'D),They pierced my hands with a drill... because I couldn't remember his name... Would you like to see the soles of my feet? Where they flagged the skin off --
0,6,135,NAD IA (CONT'D),"These are handiworks of your ""friends."" The people you swear allegiance to."
0,6,136,SAYID,"If you were innocent, I am sorry. But this bombing is another matter."
0,6,137,SAYID (CONT'D),Nadia --
0,6,137,NADIA,"Go on, Sayid. Do your work. I'm not going to tell you anything."
0,6,137,SAYID,I'm going to hurt you.
0,6,138,NADIA,I know.
0,6,141,WALT,I'm bored... Can I take Vincent down to the beach?
0,6,141,MICHAEL,"Uh... I'll take you later, man. I'm in the middle of something..."
0,6,143,WALT,But there's nothing to do around--
0,6,143,MICHAEL,Well you gotta figure out stuff to do. You know what I'm saying? You gotta find a way to entertain yourself.
0,6,145,HURLEY,"C'mon, c'mon... I know I saw it..."
0,6,146,HURLEY (CONT'D),Yes!
0,6,147,JACK,Hurley...
0,6,149,HURLEY,Whoa...
0,6,150,HURLEY (CONT'D) MICHAEL,"Dude, can I borrow this? -- Uh... I'm trying to-- -- Thanks, Man."
0,6,151,JACK,Hurley -- !
0,6,154,JACK (CONT'D),What are you doing?
0,6,157,SAYID,There's no need to keep me chained up. I can't very well run off with a hole in my leg.
0,6,159,ROUSSEAU,You have a bullet wound.
0,6,159,SAYID,I was a soldier.
0,6,159,ROUSSEAU,And are you still?
0,6,160,SAYID,It was a long time ago.
0,6,160,ROUSSEAU,"Once a soldier, always a soldier. Where did you fight?"
0,6,161,SAYID,In the Gulf War.
0,6,162,ROUSSEAU,What's the Gulf War?
0,6,162,SAYID,A lot has happened in the world since you... left.
0,6,163,SAYID (CONT'D),Alex. Who is he -- ?
0,6,163,ROUSSEAU,This Tell me more about her. woman. Nadia...
0,6,163,SAYID ROUSSEAU,"What is it you want-- -- You love her, don't you? She's everything to you."
0,6,164,SAYID,Yes.
0,6,165,ROUSSEAU,This writing on the back. What does it mean?
0,6,165,SAYID,It's... it's nothing.
0,6,166,ROUSSEAU,Still lying.
0,6,167,SAYID,I'm not lying -- it has nothing to do with --
0,6,167,ROUSSEAU SAYID,"Lies... Like this ""plane crash"". That you survived... You claim there were others-- -- More than forty, yes -- -- Then why are you alone?"
0,6,168,SAYID (CONT'D),I left them.
0,6,168,ROUSSEAU,Why?
0,6,168,SAYID,There was a -- I did something.
0,6,169,ROUSSEAU,Something you're ashamed of.
0,6,170,ROUSSEAU (CONT'D),"And Nadia? You left her, too?"
0,6,170,SAYID,She wasn't on the plane.
0,6,171,ROUSSEAU SAYID,So you heard my transmission - - Came looking for me -- for -- I didn't know you were answers... Hoping to find alive -- some way to get back to her -- -- There is no way --
0,6,173,ROUSSEAU,Dead...? How... How did--
0,6,173,SAYID,Because of me.
0,6,174,ROUSSEAU,I'm so sorry.
0,6,175,ROUSSEAU (CONT'D),I know what it's like to lose someone you...
0,6,176,ROUSSEAU (CONT'D),I want to show you something.
0,6,178,MICHAEL (O.S.),"...See, this junction here reroutes some of the spring's waterflow into a couple of suspended basins..."
0,6,179,MICHAEL (CONT'D),"Pop in some holes, we got showers. That way we keep our drinking water separate..."
0,6,179,JACK,This is... You drew this?
0,6,179,MICHAEL,"Yeah, well, I was an artist in a previous life."
0,6,179,JACK,Thought you were in construction.
0,6,179,MICHAEL,"I am. I mean, I was. Long story. Maybe I'll tell you when we've got some time to kill."
0,6,180,CHARLIE (O.S.),"Hey, Jack!"
0,6,181,JACK,What's up?
0,6,181,CHARLIE,Dunno... Hurley's all worked-up over something. Says... Says we need to come see it.
0,6,183,HURLEY,"Welcome to the first -- and, hopefully last -- Island Open."
0,6,184,JACK,What?
0,6,184,HURLEY,Dig it. Just two holes for now... Three par and no waiting.
0,6,185,JACK,"Hurley, you -- You built a... a golf course?"
0,6,185,HURLEY,"Hey, rich idiots fly to tropical islands all the time to whack balls around. Gotta be something to it."
0,6,185,MICHAEL,"All the stuff we gotta be dealing with, man... This is what you've been wasting your time on?"
0,6,187,MICHAEL,Polar bears?
0,6,187,CHARLIE,Didn't hear about the polar bear?
0,6,187,HURLEY,"-- All I'm saying is... If we're stuck here, just surviving's not gonna cut it... People need some kind of relief. We gotta find some way to have... y'know, fun. Yeah, fun. Or we're just gonna go crazy waiting for the next bad thing to happen to us."
0,6,188,CHARLIE,It's bloody brilliant!
0,6,192,ROUSSEAU (O.S.),"Beautiful, isn't it?"
0,6,193,ROUSSEAU (CONT'D),It was a gift from my love...
0,6,193,SAYID,You mean Alex?
0,6,194,ROUSSEAU,Robert. He bought this for me in Singapore. For our anniversary. It would play Chopin.
0,6,194,SAYID,I'd... like to hear it.
0,6,194,ROUSSEAU,It's broken. Has been for... a long time. It was such a comfort for me... the first few years here.
0,6,195,SAYID,I could fix it for you.
0,6,196,SAYID (CONT'D),I could take a look at it... if you free my hands...
0,6,198,SAYID (CONT'D),I'm fairly food with mechanical things... I'll need my hands to--
0,6,199,ROUSSEAU,"What is written on the back of your photograph? Did she write it, or did you?"
0,6,200,SAYID,What... What are you doing?
0,6,201,ROUSSEAU,Perhaps you won't tell me because it causes too much pain.
0,6,202,SAYID,Rousseau... You don't have to do that. Whatever it is... I only offered to fix your music box.
0,6,203,ROUSSEAU,"Some things cannot be fixed, Sayid."
0,6,205,MICHAEL,"This is a problem, man."
0,6,205,JACK,Yeah.
0,6,205,MICHAEL,"I mean, I know what I'd do... But this is your call."
0,6,205,JACK,Okay... Gimme the seven-iron.
0,6,206,JACK (CONT'D),Heads up over there.
0,6,208,SULLIVAN (O.S.),"Doc? -- Hey, Doc!"
0,6,209,SULLIVAN (CONT'D),"There you are... Somebody said you went this way. Listen... I think this rash is spreading... I mean, it's like the size of a grapefruit--"
0,6,210,SULLIVAN (CONT'D),What are you doing?
0,6,211,JACK,Uh...
0,6,212,SULLIVAN,Are you-- Are you playing golf?
0,6,213,JACK,Y-yeah.
0,6,213,SULLIVAN,Can I play?
0,6,218,ROUSSEAU (O.S.),I'm sorry. About the sedative...
0,6,219,ROUSSEAU (CONT'D),It was the only safe way for me to move you.
0,6,221,ROUSSEAU (CONT'D),"You offered to fix my music box... After all I've done to you. Striking you, shocking you... Why? Why aren't you furious with me?"
0,6,221,SAYID,There's nothing you've done to me I didn't already deserve.
0,6,221,ROUSSEAU,Perhaps you aren't still a soldier after all.
0,6,222,SAYID,Do you want me to fix your music box or don't you?
0,6,222,ROUSSEAU,Yes. Please.
0,6,222,SAYID,Then I want to know your name. Your first name.
0,6,223,ROUSSEAU,Danielle. My name is Danielle.
0,6,224,SAYID,"And how did you come to be on this island, Danielle?"
0,6,224,ROUSSEAU,We were part of a science team.
0,6,224,SAYID,A science team armed with rifles. Was Robert on the team?
0,6,224,ROUSSEAU,Yes.
0,6,225,SAYID,And Alex -- was he --?
0,6,226,ROUSSEAU,"Our vessel was three days out of Tahiti when our instruments malfunctioned... It was night -- a storm... the sounds -- The ship slammed into rocks, ran aground... The hull breached beyond repair. So we made camp... Dug out this temporary shelter... Temporary... Nearly two months we survived here... Two months before..."
0,6,227,SAYID,"Your distress signal... the message I heard. You said: ""It killed them all..."" Did you mean that... thing in the jungle?"
0,6,227,ROUSSEAU,"What ""thing""?"
0,6,228,SAYID,Then what -- ?
0,6,228,ROUSSEAU,"What killed them? Oh, what killed them? Yes, I suppose that's the question, isn't it?"
0,6,229,ROUSSEAU (CONT'D),We were coming back from the black rock. It was them. They were the carriers...
0,6,229,SAYID,What? Who --?
0,6,230,ROUSSEAU,The others.
0,6,230,SAYID,What others? And what's the black rock? Danielle -- Have you seen other people on this island?
0,6,230,ROUSSEAU,No. But I hear them. Out there in the jungle. They whisper.
0,6,231,ROUSSEAU (CONT'D),You think I'm insane.
0,6,232,SAYID,I think you've been alone. For too long.
0,6,234,SAYID,"Good morning, Nadia."
0,6,234,NADIA,Is it morning already?
0,6,235,SAYID,"I'm sorry... it's all I could find. I'll try to bring you fruit, later."
0,6,237,BOONE,You're not gonna believe this...
0,6,237,SHANNON,You learned to tie your own shoes?
0,6,237,BOONE,Funny. Somebody at the caves built a golf course in the jungle.
0,6,238,SHANNON,Are you high?
0,6,239,BOONE,"Seriously... A golf course. Doctor's there now, playing with some other--"
0,6,240,KATE,Jack? Is golfing?
0,6,240,BOONE,"S'what I hear. Don't know about you, but I gotta check this out."
0,6,241,SHANNON,"Well, wait for me, bonehead."
0,6,242,SAWYER (O.S.),A doctor playing golf...
0,6,243,SAWYER (CONT'D),"Boy-howdy, now I've heard everything. What's next? A cop eatin' a donut?"
0,6,243,KATE,"If you wanna come, you should just say so."
0,6,243,SAWYER,"Think I'll pass on that, freckles. Not big on crowds. And, face it, crowd's not too hot on me, neither."
0,6,244,KATE,"Do you like being an outcast, Sawyer?"
0,6,244,SAWYER,"Last I check, you weren't exactly runnin' the yearbook committee yourself, pumpkin..."
0,6,244,KATE,"Last I checked, you had a knife sticking out of your arm."
0,6,244,SAWYER,Hell -- misunderstandings happen.
0,6,245,KATE,"So this is it, huh? Just... sitting around, pretending it's okay that they all hate you?"
0,6,245,SAWYER,Works for me.
0,6,245,KATE,No it doesn't. Because I know better.
0,6,246,KATE (CONT'D),One outcast to another? I'd think about making more of an effort.
0,6,246,SAWYER,Duly noted.
0,6,249,SAYID,Some things can be fixed. You see?
0,6,250,ROUSSEAU,"Thank you. Oh, god... Thank you so much. How long it's been since I've heard music. It is... Thank you."
0,6,251,SAYID,Danielle -- please let me go.
0,6,252,ROUSSEAU,Go? Go where?
0,6,252,SAYID,Back to the people I told you about.
0,6,253,ROUSSEAU,The ones you left behind? But you said -- you said you had to leave them. That you were ashamed.
0,6,254,SAYID,That is why I have to go back.
0,6,255,ROUSSEAU,-- You can't. You have to stay. It's not safe...
0,6,255,SAYID,Not safe? What's not --
0,6,255,ROUSSEAU SAYID,"You need me. You can't leave. -- Danielle, please --"
0,6,256,SAYID (CONT'D),What -- What was --
0,6,257,SAYID (CONT'D),What are you doing?
0,6,258,ROUSSEAU,"If we're lucky, it's one of the bears."
0,6,258,SAYID,If we're lucky?
0,6,258,ROUSSEAU,Dinner.
0,6,260,SAYID,Free me -- so I can come with you. Help you --
0,6,260,ROUSSEAU,No. You'll leave me -- Run off. You have to stay --
0,6,261,SAYID,"Danielle, listen to me... It might be that thing out there. The monster..."
0,6,262,ROUSSEAU,Poor Sayid... There are no such things as monsters.
0,6,264,OMAR (PRE-LAP),You have to execute her...
0,6,265,SAYID,What --?
0,6,266,OMAR,The Jaseem woman has given us nothing. This will be a message to others who will not talk --
0,6,266,SAYID,I just need more time with her --
0,6,267,OMAR,"You've had more than a month. You failed, Sayid. Now take her outside and shoot her. Is this a problem?"
0,6,267,SAYID,No. It is not a problem.
0,6,270,NADIA,What did you bring me today --?
0,6,272,SAYID,Put it on.
0,6,273,NADIA,"Are you going to hurt me, Sayid?"
0,6,284,HURLEY,Dude. I think you stuck it.
0,6,285,KATE,This thing have a ladies' tee?
0,6,286,JACK,Hey -- When did you --
0,6,286,KATE,Little while ago. Almost didn't recognize you... You're smiling.
0,6,286,JACK,Gotta watch that.
0,6,286,KATE,How'd you come up with --
0,6,287,JACK,Not me. It was all Hurley...
0,6,288,JACK (CONT'D),I'm going crazy trying to make everyone feel safe -- I'm not sleeping because I want everyone to feel safe. This guy builds a golf course? Everyone feels safe. Genius.
0,6,289,HURLEY,Aw... Crap. Do-over!
0,6,289,CHARLIE,"Nice shot, Tiger. And it's called a Mulligan."
0,6,290,WALT (O.S.),Dad?
0,6,291,MICHAEL,"Hey, Walt -- Check it out, man."
0,6,291,WALT,You left me alone at the caves...
0,6,291,MICHAEL,What? I left you with Claire...
0,6,292,MICHAEL,"Oh. Oh, man... I'm sorry. I just... I just got caught up -- I'm really sorry, Walt. I screwed up. I'm make it up to you. Hey -- You wanna play?"
0,6,294,WALT,Naw. That's okay. There's other people waiting.
0,6,294,MICHAEL,"They won't mind. C'mon, man, take a swing."
0,6,296,SAYID,I'll take it from here.
0,6,298,NADIA,What -- What's happening?
0,6,299,NADIA (CONT'D),What are you doing?
0,6,299,SAYID,"Forty meters out this door, there's a supply truck that will be leaving shortly. They don't check them on the way out, only coming in... Get inside, cover yourself any way you can... They won't reach the city for thirty minutes... plenty of time for you to jump out and hide --"
0,6,300,NADIA,Come with me.
0,6,300,SAYID,-- I can't. Desertion... they would kill my family. I'm sorry... I don't have your courage.
0,6,300,NADIA,You have more than you know.
0,6,302,SAYID,What are you --?
0,6,303,SAYID (CONT'D),Nadia... Please... You have to go.
0,6,303,OMAR (O.S.),Sayid!
0,6,304,OMAR (CONT'D),What are you doing?
0,6,306,SAYID,Omar... Don't --
0,6,306,OMAR,Guar--!
0,6,308,NADIA,Sayid -- You have to come with me now. They'll kill you...
0,6,308,SAYID,"No. You escaped, stole my gun and shot him... And then you shot me."
0,6,308,NADIA,What -- ?
0,6,310,NADIA (CONT'D),Sayid!
0,6,311,SAYID,"Take it. Please, Nadia..."
0,6,312,SAYID (CONT'D),Now go! GO!!
0,6,316,SAYID (O.S.),"Put the gun down, Danielle."
0,6,318,SAYID (CONT'D),Put it down. On the ground.
0,6,319,SAYID (CONT'D),Please... I don't wish to hurt you.
0,6,320,ROUSSEAU SAYID,You already have.
0,6,322,ROUSSEAU (O.S.),That was his gun...
0,6,323,ROUSSEAU (CONT'D),The firing pin's been removed. Robert didn't notice it was missing either when I shot him.
0,6,324,SAYID,You... But you loved him.
0,6,324,ROUSSEAU,He was sick.
0,6,324,SAYID,Sick...?
0,6,324,ROUSSEAU,It took them... One after the other. I... I had no choice. They were already lost...
0,6,324,SAYID,You killed them --?
0,6,324,ROUSSEAU,What would've happened if we were rescued? It would've spread... I couldn't let that happen... I won't.
0,6,325,SAYID,I am not sick!
0,6,327,ROUSSEAU,I know.
0,6,328,SAYID,Then why kill me?
0,6,328,ROUSSEAU,I don't... I don't want... I... I don't know how else to stop you...
0,6,329,ROUSSEAU (CONT'D),I can't let you go... You don't... understand... To have someone... to talk to... to touch...
0,6,330,SAYID,"""You'll find me in the next life... if not this one."""
0,6,330,ROUSSEAU,What?
0,6,330,SAYID,The writing. On the back of Nadia's photo.
0,6,331,SAYID (CONT'D),I know what it is like to hold on to someone. I've been holding on for the last seven years to just a thought... A blind hope... that somewhere... she is still alive.
0,6,332,SAYID (CONT'D),"But the more I hold on, the more I pull away from those around me. I may know in my heart that I cannot ever let her go... But I can't find her alone."
0,6,334,SAYID (CONT'D),That's why I need to go back. The only way off this... place -- Is with their help.
0,6,335,SAYID (CONT'D),Come with me. We have a doctor -
0,6,336,SAYID (CONT'D),"Danielle, you have to stop punishing yourself. You don't have to be alone."
0,6,337,ROUSSEAU,Yes. I do.
0,6,338,ROUSSEAU (CONT'D),"Your people, the ones you're determined to return to... Watch them closely."
0,6,340,SAYID,Who is Alex?
0,6,341,ROUSSEAU,Alex was my child.
0,6,345,CHARLIE,Bollocks. You see that?
0,6,346,HURLEY,Dude. You were robbed.
0,6,346,MICHAEL,"`Kay, Jack. S'up to you now. Sink this and you get to wear the blazer."
0,6,346,KATE,No pressure.
0,6,347,HURLEY,Five bucks says he makes it.
0,6,347,BOONE,Make it ten and you're on.
0,6,347,CHARLIE,You're betting against me?
0,6,347,HURLEY,"No offense, dude. But you're a duffer like me."
0,6,347,SULLIVAN,"Hey, I don't have any cash. But I'll put up my dinner tonight on the doc."
0,6,349,SAWYER (O.S.),I got two tubes of sunscreen and a flashlight says he chokes.
0,6,353,KATE,I'll take that action.
0,6,354,BOONE,"Yeah, me, too."
0,6,354,SHANNON,"You already bet on Jack, dumbass."
0,6,354,BOONE,"We can use the sunscreen, princess."
0,6,359,LOCKE,Does your father know you're here?
0,6,361,WALT,Can you teach me how to do that?
0,6,371,THE END,
