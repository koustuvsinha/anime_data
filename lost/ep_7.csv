0,7,21,CLAIRE,Wh -- what's happening?
0,7,21,LOCKE,You know what's happening.
0,7,22,CLAIRE,I don't understand -- Why are you...?
0,7,23,LOCKE,"He was your responsibility. But you gave him away, Claire."
0,7,24,LOCKE (CONT'D),Everyone pays the price now.
0,7,46,CHARLIE,Claire? Claire!?!
0,7,47,CHARLIE (CONT'D),Claire -- Stop! It's me -- It's Charlie -- It's okay!
0,7,48,SUN MICHAEL,I think it's Claire. What's going on?
0,7,48,HURLEY JIN,Is she okay? Is it the baby?
0,7,49,CHARLIE (CONT'D),Claire. Listen to me --
0,7,50,CHARLIE (CONT'D),It's okay. You were dreaming -- sleepwalking...
0,7,52,CHARLIE (CONT'D),Claire -- What happened...?
0,7,56,JACK,Must've been a hell of a nightmare.
0,7,56,CLAIRE,Who says it was a nightmare?
0,7,57,JACK,"I'd say when someone makes fist so tight they dig their fingernails a quarter inch into their palms, they're not dreaming about pony rides. Y'ever sleepwalk before?"
0,7,57,CLAIRE,No. I mean I don't think so-- I mean how would I know?
0,7,57,JACK,"It'd get back to you. I had a girlfriend once, told me I talked in my sleep."
0,7,57,CLAIRE,What'd you say?
0,7,57,JACK,"Don't know. Whatever it was, she didn't like it."
0,7,58,JACK (CONT'D),How was your OBgyn -- in Sydney?
0,7,58,CLAIRE,Good. She's good.
0,7,58,JACK,She was okay with letting you fly in your third trimester?
0,7,59,CLAIRE,I had a checkup the week before... she said it would be okay.
0,7,59,JACK,Ultrasound cool?
0,7,59,CLAIRE,Yeah. Very healthy.
0,7,59,JACK,How've you been feeling?
0,7,59,CLAIRE,My back hurts. Probably from sleeping on the ground. I get dizzy when I stand up too fast. And I have to pee all the time.
0,7,59,JACK,Eating enough?
0,7,59,CLAIRE,"Boar N' Bananas, yeah."
0,7,59,JACK,How many weeks in are you? ... what was the date you found out you were pregnant?
0,7,62,THOMAS CLAIRE,"-- is it pink? -- I don't know yet! -- Did you pee on it? -- Yes! Gimme a second-- -- maybe you didn't use it right -- -- I can pee on a wand, -- what color is it? Thomas-- -- how long has it been? -- sixty-six seconds..."
0,7,63,THOMAS CLAIRE,-- oh God-- -- shh.
0,7,64,THOMAS CLAIRE,"-- okay, it's definitely two-- two lines-- -- two pink lines?"
0,7,64,THOMAS,"Pink? No-- these are, like, red..."
0,7,64,CLAIRE,... they're pink.
0,7,64,THOMAS,-- these? That's...
0,7,65,THOMAS (CONT'D) CLAIRE,"Okay, first of all, these tests are not always -- Thomas... accurate."
0,7,65,THOMAS (CONT'D),"No, come on: my uncle thought he had testicular cancer -- remember that?!"
0,7,65,CLAIRE,He did! He's dead!
0,7,65,THOMAS,"No, it was a-- a-- wrong, a bad diagnosis! This thing doesn't mean for sure that you're pregnant -- we should go get another one--"
0,7,65,CLAIRE,"I'm six weeks late. Six weeks. That never happens. I'm pregnant. ... so, um..."
0,7,66,THOMAS,"Okay. Okay, so this is gonna be okay."
0,7,66,CLAIRE,... I know...
0,7,67,THOMAS,Claire...
0,7,69,CLAIRE,Stop it.
0,7,69,THOMAS,"No, I'm not kidding."
0,7,69,CLAIRE,Can you imagine that? My mom would disown me--
0,7,69,THOMAS,She basically has already.
0,7,70,CLAIRE,"With what, my five dollar an hour job at the Fish N' Fry?"
0,7,70,THOMAS,You're not the only one with a job. I mean... I've got my art.
0,7,70,CLAIRE,You're sweet. But this isn't what we want.
0,7,70,THOMAS,"Maybe it is. I mean this could be... I dunno, the best thing ever."
0,7,71,CLAIRE,... you'd... really wanna...?
0,7,71,THOMAS,Claire. I love you.
0,7,73,JACK,This is a first.
0,7,74,JACK (CONT'D),You. Standing still. Middle of the day. Doing nothing. Amazing.
0,7,76,KATE,I'm doing something.
0,7,76,JACK,Yeah? What's that?
0,7,76,KATE,"I'm sinking. When the water goes out, it takes the sand with it and... you sink. I used to do this with my Mom. When I was a kid."
0,7,77,JACK,Ah. A new plan -- sink your way off the island. Sayid would be proud.
0,7,78,KATE,He's been gone almost a week.
0,7,78,JACK,Something tells me he'll be okay.
0,7,79,KATE,"So what're you doing, Jack?"
0,7,79,JACK,Bringing down some water. Bringing back some fish.
0,7,79,KATE,Whatever would we do without you?
0,7,80,JACK,Claire's going to have the baby soon.
0,7,83,CHARLIE (O.S.),"""Dear Diary -- Still on the bloody island. Ate a bug today. Love, Claire."""
0,7,84,CHARLIE (CONT'D),What separates us from these savage Yanks if we do not have tea? Feeling better?
0,7,84,CLAIRE,It was just a dream.
0,7,84,CHARLIE,I have this dream -- craziest thing. I'm driving a bus and all my teeth start falling out. And my mum's in the back. Eating biscuits. `Course I don't wake up screaming.
0,7,84,CLAIRE,"I'm fine, Charlie."
0,7,85,CHARLIE,Right. Well. Of course you are.
0,7,86,CHARLIE (CONT'D),"Anyway, I was just thinking how hard it must be for you... y'know, being here in this... place -- without your family and your friends and I just wanted to tell you that we could be friend -- I mean I could be your friend. Not like we should do each other's hair or anything -- I just mean... If you ever needed anyone to talk to. About anything. I'm here."
0,7,87,CLAIRE,"Charlie, trust me. You don't... You'll change your mind. I'm..."
0,7,88,CHARLIE,Lemme guess. Damaged goods.
0,7,88,CLAIRE,Something like that.
0,7,89,CHARLIE,All right then.
0,7,89,CLAIRE,I didn't mean you--
0,7,89,CHARLIE,"Sweet dreams, Claire."
0,7,91,RACHEL,"-- oh yeah, it's a girl."
0,7,91,CLAIRE,"-- God, it just feels impossible. Thomas cleaned out his whole apartment -- I'm officially moving in on Tuesday--"
0,7,91,RACHEL,-- wow --
0,7,91,CLAIRE,"-- I know, he's the best."
0,7,92,CLAIRE (CONT'D) RACHEL,Maybe we shouldn't -- -- Uh uh. You're not backing out now --
0,7,92,CLAIRE (CONT'D),It feels silly --
0,7,92,RACHEL,"He's just a psychic, Claire. I thought you were into this... all your astrology stuff..."
0,7,92,CLAIRE,... is for fun. I don't need someone telling me what's gonna happen or how to live my --
0,7,92,RACHEL,"It's not about what you need Claire. It's about what's fun. You'll go in, find out if it's a boy or a girl -- I mean, the doctors can't tell until you're at least two months preggers... So unless you have another excuse..."
0,7,96,MALKIN,I need your hands. For this.
0,7,97,MALKIN (CONT'D),"... oh... ... when did you, uh...? Find out?"
0,7,98,CLAIRE,... what.
0,7,99,MALKIN,"... you know, about the baby."
0,7,100,CLAIRE,... uh... two days ago.
0,7,102,RACHEL CLAIRE,She hasn't told her mom yet -- we're afraid she-- Shhhh!
0,7,103,CLAIRE (CONT'D),"What. What, should I not tell her?"
0,7,104,MALKIN,"I'm not, uh... I'm overdue for a break --"
0,7,105,RACHEL CLAIRE,What? A break? We have an -- hold on-- were you appointment -- thinking something?
0,7,105,MALKIN (CONT'D),I'm not doing this reading.
0,7,105,CLAIRE,But you were gonna say something--
0,7,106,MALKIN,Go. Now.
0,7,107,RACHEL,What a freak.
0,7,119,SHADOW,Shhhhhhhhhhhhh.
0,7,125,CHARLIE,Someone attacked her!
0,7,126,JACK,What?
0,7,126,CLAIRE CHARLIE,They -- they held me down -- -- Which way did he go?
0,7,126,CLAIRE,-- I don't know... I didn't... he ran... I think --
0,7,126,JACK CLAIRE,How long -- -- Just now. He just --
0,7,127,HURLEY,What's going on?
0,7,127,CHARLIE JACK,We should fan out -- search the area around the caves... -- Wait... hold on --
0,7,127,CHARLIE,-- He can't have gotten far. Hurley -- You two -- come on!
0,7,128,JACK,"C'mon, let's sit down. Okay? Can you get her some water, man?"
0,7,128,ETHAN,Sure. Yes -- of course.
0,7,129,JACK,"Okay -- you're safe, Claire. Try to calm down -- We're here..."
0,7,129,MICHAEL,Did you get a look at him at all?
0,7,129,CLAIRE JACK,It was dark -- I didn't see -- -- Where did this happen?
0,7,129,CLAIRE,Here -- I was sleeping and woke up and he was... ... he was trying to hurt my baby.
0,7,130,CLAIRE (CONT'D),He had a -- a thing -- it was -- I don't know -- a needle I think -- he was... he was doing something --
0,7,132,CLAIRE (CONT'D),He was trying to hurt my baby.
0,7,134,HURLEY,"We hoofed it around the entire perimeter, man."
0,7,134,JACK,Nobody saw or heard anything?
0,7,134,HURLEY,Uh-uh. Everyone was asleep. Nada.
0,7,135,HURLEY (CONT'D),So I had an idea. I'm out there looking for a psycho with Scott and Steve right... and I'm realizing... who the hell are Scott and Steve?
0,7,135,JACK,I'm not following you...
0,7,135,HURLEY,"If I were a cop and some woman got attacked, we'd canvas, right? Find a witness. Knock on doors. But we don't have any doors."
0,7,135,JACK,None of this is helping me understand--
0,7,135,HURLEY,We don't know who's living here and who's still at the beach. We don't know each other.
0,7,136,HUR LEY (CONT'D),"My name isn't Hurley, it's Hugo Reyes. Hurley's a nickname. Why?"
0,7,137,HUR LEY (CONT'D),"I'm not telling you -- but what I'm saying is, we need to start finding out who everyone is here."
0,7,137,JACK,You want to start a census?
0,7,137,HURLEY,"Yeah, like a registry. Names. What people look like. Who's related to who. We lay down the law, maybe everyone won't go around attacking each other. I mean -- c'mon -- It feels like someone's getting punched or stabbed or something every other day, man. We gotta find who did this to her."
0,7,139,CHARLIE,You all right?
0,7,140,CHARLIE (CONT'D),"Don't worry... You want to shut your eyes, I'll be here all night. No one's gonna get near you. I won't leave you, Claire. Promise."
0,7,145,THOMAS,"-- wow, we have drapes now."
0,7,145,CLAIRE,"I know, I sort of feel grown up all of a sudden. Do you like them?"
0,7,145,THOMAS,"-- yeah, they're good."
0,7,145,CLAIRE,"I don't know why drapes represent age for me, it just... feels like something my mum would do--"
0,7,146,CLAIRE (CONT'D),"Sasha called-- they're going out tonight, wanted to know if we wanted to come..."
0,7,147,CLAIRE (CONT'D),"What? I didn't eat all the chips, there's another bag --"
0,7,147,THOMAS,Claire... ... I can't do this.
0,7,147,CLAIRE,Do what? D'you have a bad day? You're pale.
0,7,148,THOMAS,... this isn't working.
0,7,149,THOMAS (CONT'D),-- you knew that.
0,7,149,CLAIRE,-- I what?
0,7,150,CLAIRE (CONT'D),"Just... so I don't over-react... Tommy, are you breaking up with--?"
0,7,150,THOMAS,"The past two months, you-- you're-- there's always some plan, some responsibility, somewhere we have to be, someone we have to talk to--"
0,7,150,CLAIRE,-- like who? Like what? Am I-- being too-- I'm just trying to-- to make sure when the baby comes--
0,7,150,THOMAS,-- and the baby! That's like not-- I mean it's like this now. Y'know?
0,7,150,CLAIRE,But you said we should do this.
0,7,151,CLAIRE,You can't just... change your mind.
0,7,152,THOMAS,"How the hell am I supposed to be a dad, Claire? I've got my own -- I mean, what about my painting, my life?"
0,7,152,CLAIRE,"God, I knew this was gonna happen."
0,7,152,THOMAS,
0,7,152,CLAIRE,"Hey, you bastard, don't justify what you're doing by trying to make this about --"
0,7,152,THOMAS,I'm not doing anything. Okay? I'm doing nothing. You think I don't see what you did? You were supposed to be on the pill.
0,7,152,CLAIRE THOMAS,-- you think I got pregnant on purpose?! That this was I don't even care! some-- -- some scheme?! Some way to trap you?! Are you out of -- it's over! your m-- -- It isn't over! Look at me! -- I'm outta here--
0,7,155,HURLEY,"Okay, so it's Scott Jenkins..."
0,7,156,SCOTT,Jackson.
0,7,156,STEVE,I'm Jenkins. Steve.
0,7,156,HURLEY,Right. Steve... Jenkins. And you dudes were on vacation in Australia. Just the two of you... Together.
0,7,156,STEVE,Yep.
0,7,156,HURLEY,"So... Safe to assume... I mean, I guess you're, uh... I mean, you two are... y'know... ...Married... Or something?"
0,7,157,SCOTT,Nah. We're both single. And my buddy's got serious commitment issues.
0,7,157,STEVE,"No, I don't. Just haven't found the right person yet."
0,7,159,HURLEY,"Excuse me, guys."
0,7,160,HURLEY (CONT'D),Yo.
0,7,162,HURLEY (CONT'D),"It's John, right? John Locke?"
0,7,162,LOCKE,This about your census?
0,7,162,HURLEY,"Yeah, thought it'd be a good idea to, y'know, find out who everybody is. Get their names, places of residence --"
0,7,162,LOCKE,And who's checking to see who you are?
0,7,163,HURLEY,M-me?
0,7,163,LOCKE,It was a joke.
0,7,163,HURLEY,Oh... Yeah... Good one.
0,7,163,LOCKE,"Well, you already know my name. Lived in Tustin, California for most of my life."
0,7,163,HURLEY,Uh huh. And your reason for travel?
0,7,164,LOCKE,Sorry?
0,7,164,HURLEY,Y'know... The reason you were in Australia.
0,7,166,LOCKE,I was looking for something.
0,7,167,HURLEY,"Looking for... O-okay. So, uh... Did you find it?"
0,7,167,LOCKE,No. It found me.
0,7,169,HURLEY,"No. No, that's great."
0,7,170,KATE,She was attacked? Is she okay?
0,7,172,CHARLIE,She'll feel a lot better when we find the nutter responsible. Did you see anyone leaving the beach last night?
0,7,172,KATE,"People come and go, but I don't think so..."
0,7,173,KATE (CONT'D),What?
0,7,173,JACK,I'm not sure anything happened.
0,7,173,CHARLIE,What?
0,7,173,JACK,"Claire told Michael and me this -- ""attacker"" -- was trying to inject her with something..."
0,7,173,JACK (CONT'D) CHARLIE,"... Two nights in a row she wakes up screaming. The first time she was -- You think this was all in sleepwalking... her head? Did you see her? She's terrified, man..."
0,7,173,JACK (CONT'D),Look -- she said this guy was trying to hurt her baby. Why would someone do this now? With all of us sleeping twenty feet away?
0,7,173,CHARLIE,You think she's lying?
0,7,174,JACK CHARLIE,"No -- pregnant women have extremely lucid -- These are -- ""Lucid?"" Right -- You textbook anxiety nightmares -- just know exactly what's happening with everyone, don't you?"
0,7,174,KATE,Hey.
0,7,176,KATE (CONT'D),Let's say she's telling the truth. What do we do?
0,7,177,KATE (CONT'D),Okay. And if it's all in her head?
0,7,177,JACK,"Claire's due in a little more than a week. Maybe two. If she stays stressed like this -- has another panic attack... it could trigger an early labor. And out here? With no instruments, no monitors, no anaesthetic? That would not be good."
0,7,178,CHARLIE,It's not all in her head.
0,7,179,KATE,So what do we do?
0,7,180,HURLEY,Hey -- Lance.
0,7,180,ETHAN,Sorry?
0,7,180,HURLEY,"Your name's Lance, right?"
0,7,181,ETHAN,Ethan.
0,7,181,HURLEY,Dude. That's right. Lance is the little skinny guy. With the glasses and the red hair.
0,7,182,ETHAN,I can see how you'd get us confused.
0,7,182,HURLEY,"Sorry, too many names and faces. Pretty pathetic -- I mean, you'd think after a couple of weeks on an island with the same people we'd all know each other..."
0,7,182,ETHAN,Yes. You would think that. Well... it is what it is.
0,7,183,HURLEY,"So, uh, we're doing a list, you know, of survivors. Name, home address. Like that."
0,7,183,ETHAN,Well you already have my name.
0,7,183,HURLEY ETHAN,Not Lance. -- Definitely not.
0,7,183,HURLEY,Last name?
0,7,184,ETHAN,Rom.
0,7,184,HURLEY,Rom? R-O-M?
0,7,184,ETHAN,That's right.
0,7,184,HURLEY,Great. Where you from Ethan Rom?
0,7,184,ETHAN,Ontario. Canada.
0,7,184,HURLEY,"Right on. Love Canada. Great... uh... weather. Well, that covers it. Thanks for your time, dude."
0,7,185,ETHAN,"Hey, Hurley -- What's this for?"
0,7,185,HURLEY,"Nothing, man. Just... Thought it'd be a good idea."
0,7,187,JACK (O.S.),Claire?
0,7,188,CLAIRE,D'you find him?
0,7,188,JACK,No--
0,7,188,CLAIRE,-- what if he comes back?
0,7,190,JACK,Claire... this situation we're in -- The crash. That no one's come for us -- And this place... It can mess with your head a little. Maybe make you see things that aren't there. And I know it feels real...
0,7,190,CLAIRE,I don't...?
0,7,190,JACK,"Your baby's coming. Soon. And I can't imagine how scary that must be... but the more upset you get, the more dangerous it is for you... and the baby. I want you to take these."
0,7,191,CLAIRE,What is it?
0,7,191,JACK,A sedative. It's very mild. Commonly used in situations like yours. It won't hurt the baby. I promise.
0,7,192,CLAIRE,You... don't believe me.
0,7,192,JACK,Claire --
0,7,194,CLAIRE JACK,You think I'm making this up? I get attacked and you want to give me sleeping pills? -- They're not sleeping -- It's a very mild sedative...
0,7,195,CLAIRE,I'm leaving --
0,7,195,JACK CLAIRE,What? Wait -- I was okay at the beach -- It's not safe here...
0,7,197,MALKIN,... yes?
0,7,199,CLAIRE,"Mr. Malkin, I met you before."
0,7,200,MALKIN,"... yes, I remember."
0,7,200,CLAIRE,... you wouldn't give me a reading. I was hoping maybe you would now.
0,7,202,CLAIRE,"If you're a psychic, why do you have to count the money?"
0,7,202,MALKIN,That's not how it works.
0,7,202,CLAIRE,I was just -- I was joking.
0,7,203,CLAIRE (CONT'D),-- are you not-- ready yet? For--?
0,7,203,MALKIN,Yes.
0,7,204,CLAIRE,... so... how does it work?
0,7,204,MALKIN,... I don't know.
0,7,206,MALKIN (CONT'D),When did he leave you?
0,7,207,CLAIRE,Last week. Was that... why you didn't want to do my reading? Last time?
0,7,208,MALKIN,"Oh, no. I saw something. A sort of... blurry thing."
0,7,208,CLAIRE,And... blurry's bad?
0,7,208,MALKIN,... blurry's bad...
0,7,209,MALKIN (CONT'D),You want to know what to do. About your baby.
0,7,209,CLAIRE,Yes. Please.
0,7,210,MALKIN,... I can tell you. ... this is... important.
0,7,210,CLAIRE,... okay...
0,7,210,MALKIN,"It's... crucial. That you. You, yourself, raise this child."
0,7,210,CLAIRE MALKIN,I'm... you mean with Thomas? -- The father of this child Is he going to c--? will play no part in its life. Or yours.
0,7,210,CLAIRE,"Then what do you mean ""you, yourself must raise..."""
0,7,210,MALKIN,This child... parented by anyone else -- anyone other than you... Danger surrounds this baby.
0,7,210,CLAIRE,"... ""Danger""?"
0,7,210,MALKIN,Your nature... your spirit -- your goodness... must be an influence in the development of this child.
0,7,210,CLAIRE,
0,7,210,MALKIN,This is no happy life. Not for this child. Not without you.
0,7,211,CLAIRE,"Listen, I don't think that--"
0,7,211,MALKIN,It can't be another. YOU MUSTN'T
0,7,212,CLAIRE,Got it. Fantastic. Thanks so much for taking my two hundred --
0,7,213,MALKIN,"Take it-- Ms. Littleton, I'm begging you just to consider--"
0,7,213,CLAIRE,I can't raise this child by myself-- I can't raise me by myself --
0,7,213,MALKIN CLAIRE,
0,7,213,MALKIN,"Ms. Littleton, please!"
0,7,214,MALKIN (CONT'D),I promise you -- the baby needs
0,7,217,CLAIRE,-- Hello?
0,7,217,MALKIN (V.O.),Ms. Littleton. It's Richard Malkin.
0,7,218,CLAIRE,-- oh my God...
0,7,218,MALKIN (V.O.),-- listen to me-- I have a plan. Something that will make this all better--
0,7,218,CLAIRE,"-- you can't keep doing this: calling me, dropping letters in the post box -- I know what you want, but it's too late. I'm seeing adoption services tomorrow, the--"
0,7,218,MALKIN (V.O.),I know. Do what I'm suggesting and you'll still be able to give up the baby--
0,7,218,CLAIRE,-- what I do with my baby is none of your business --
0,7,218,MALKIN (V.O.),"If you don't do what I'm suggesting, great danger will --"
0,7,218,CLAIRE,-- Great danger will befall you if
0,7,219,MALKIN (V.O.),I have money for you.
0,7,220,MALKIN (V.O.) (CONT'D),"Come see me. Listen to my offer -- I know what you're feeling inside, Claire. That you're doubting your decision to give up the --"
0,7,220,CLAIRE,-- good night.
0,7,225,CHARLIE,Hi.
0,7,226,CHARLIE (CONT'D),Where you going?

0,7,226,CHARLIE,What happened? Did Jack --
0,7,226,CLAIRE,Jack tried to dope me up is what happened. He thinks I'm -- I'm making all this up. That it's not really happening.
0,7,226,CHARLIE,"Ah. So as proof of your sanity, you go tromping through the jungle alone. Well done."
0,7,227,CLAIRE,I'm not crazy.
0,7,229,SHANNON,"You want my ""information?"" Name. Shannon Rutherford. Age. Twenty. Address. Crap Hole Island."
0,7,229,HURLEY,So where were you guys last night?
0,7,229,SHANNON,
0,7,231,BOONE,What's up with the interrogation?
0,7,231,HURLEY,"Y'know, you're like the twentieth person to ask me that today. Why's everyone so uptight about answering a few questions?"
0,7,231,BOONE,"Maybe we're not cool with you starting up your own little Patriot Act, man."
0,7,231,SHANNON,He's a liberal.
0,7,232,BOONE,So why the list?
0,7,232,HURLEY,"It's nothing, really -- we had an incident in the valley last night."
0,7,232,SHANNON,"""Incident?"""
0,7,232,HURLEY,"Claire -- the pregnant girl? Ya know her? Yeah, she kinda got, uh... attacked a little"
0,7,232,SHANNON BOONE,-- what? Is she okay?
0,7,232,HURLEY (CONT'D),"Yeah. She's shook up, but..."
0,7,232,SHANNON,I am not moving to the rape caves.
0,7,233,BOONE,Hey -- y'know your life would be much easier if you just had the manifest. We crossed off the names of the dead after we burned the fuselage... so it should be a full roster of the rest of us.
0,7,233,HURLEY,What? You serious? Who has it?
0,7,233,BOONE,... who do you think?
0,7,234,HURLEY,I'm gonna lay it out straight.
0,7,234,SAWYER,You do that.
0,7,234,HURLEY,I hear you have the flight manifest. I need it and I want you to give it to me.
0,7,234,SAWYER,That so.
0,7,234,HURLEY,Now you can do what you usually do when someone asks you for something and tell me to screw off...
0,7,234,SAWYER,Screw off.
0,7,234,HURLEY,Or you can just give it to me. Because dude? You could use the points.
0,7,234,SAWYER,"Gosh. You sure know how to butter a man up, Stay-Puff."
0,7,235,HURLEY,It's a gift I have.
0,7,236,SAWYER,Manifest's in the tent. Take it.
0,7,238,CHARLIE,Please let me carry your bag...
0,7,238,CLAIRE,I'm fine.
0,7,238,CHARLIE,Yes. You are. But I can still carry your --
0,7,239,CLAIRE,Why'd you come after me?
0,7,239,CHARLIE,Uh... well... it's probably because I like you.
0,7,240,CHARLIE (CONT'D),What?
0,7,240,CLAIRE,"You don't like me, Charlie. You only think you like me. Maybe because I'm so damn... pathetic with my big disgusting belly... And yes, aren't you sweet and affectionate -- But you'll change your mind. Maybe it'll be a week or a month... but it'll wear off and you'll get on with it and I'll be a stark raving madwoman with a crying b--OW!"
0,7,241,CHARLIE CLAIRE,Claire -- ? OW -- Oh no... OW--
0,7,242,CHARLIE,What's the matter?
0,7,243,CLAIRE,I think it's coming --
0,7,246,CHARLIE,Was that another one?
0,7,246,CLAIRE,Yeah...
0,7,246,CHARLIE CLAIRE,"We need to time these, right? That's what you do -- time -- Charlie... the contractions --"
0,7,246,CHARLIE,"You just need to stay calm, all right? Big deep breaths... Aw bloody hell --"
0,7,246,CLAIRE CHARLIE,You need to get Jack. -- What?
0,7,246,CLAIRE,I'll be all right...
0,7,246,CHARLIE,I am not leaving you alone. I can deliver a baby!
0,7,246,CLAIRE,"Charlie, please just get --"
0,7,246,CHARLIE,"I can do this-- it happens all the time, it must!"
0,7,246,CLAIRE,You don't know how to --
0,7,247,CHARLIE,"Listen: trust me -- I'm not going to let anything happen -- You're safe -- Yeah -- I may not know what I'm doing, but I'll figure it out -- If I can kick heroin, I can deliver a baby."
0,7,248,CHARLIE (CONT'D),"Okay: let me explain. I'm an addict. Was an addict. But look, I've been clean for five days!"
0,7,249,CLAIRE,Get. Jack.
0,7,249,CHARLIE,Right.
0,7,252,SLAVITT,Arlene and Joseph will bring you to Melbourne. They'll pay your living and medical expenses.
0,7,252,ARLENE,We found you an apartment. It's a nice place -- it has a balcony.
0,7,253,SLAVITT,"As discussed, once the baby is born and handed over to the Stewarts you will have no right to see the child again."
0,7,253,ARLENE,"-- But so you know, we live here, now, I mean, I moved from Chicago years ago and... we'll be raising the baby here, and..."
0,7,254,ARLENE (CONT'D),Sorry.
0,7,254,SLAVITT,You will have no right to correspond with the child and it will be entirely up to Arlene and Joseph to decide whether to tell the child anything about you. Understood?
0,7,255,CLAIRE,Yes.
0,7,255,SLAVITT,"Upon your discharge from the hospital, you will be given an additional payment of twenty thousand dollars."
0,7,255,CLAIRE,I just... just want you to take good care of the baby.
0,7,255,ARLENE,Of course we will.
0,7,256,SLAVITT,I'll need you to sign and date where indicated.
0,7,257,CLAIRE,"Do you know ""Catch a Falling Star?"" It's a song, like a lullaby?"
0,7,257,ARLENE,"Catch a falling star, put it in your pocket--?"
0,7,257,CLAIRE,My father used to sing that to me. Could you sing it for the baby? Every once in a while?
0,7,257,ARLENE,Of course.
0,7,258,CLAIRE,I've... I'm sorry-- I'm-- leaving--
0,7,258,ARLENE,-- you're what?! You can't --
0,7,260,CLAIRE,"Okay, what is it? Your ""offer."""
0,7,264,CHARLIE,"Hey -- Oh, thank God -- What's your name?"
0,7,264,ETHAN,Ethan -- are you all right?
0,7,264,CHARLIE,Ethan -- I need you to go to the caves. Run back to the caves -- and get Jack... tell him that Claire's --
0,7,264,ETHAN,Claire? Is she okay?
0,7,264,CHARLIE,She's having the baby -- Get him. Fast. I'll be with her --
0,7,265,CHARLIE (CONT'D),Right through there. On the path. Go!
0,7,266,ETHAN,Of course.
0,7,268,CHARLIE,Claire! Claire!!! He's coming!
0,7,270,CHARLIE (CONT'D) CLAIRE,"Jack's on his way, he'll be -- it hurts-- here-- are you--? What's--?"
0,7,270,CHARLIE (CONT'D),"Okay, okay-- he'll be here, just breathe, keep breathing..."
0,7,271,CHARLIE (CONT'D),"Like this. Inhale, exhale, all that-- do it with me --"
0,7,272,CLAIRE,... I'm not supposed to be here.
0,7,272,CHARLIE,I think we've all been feeling a bit of that--
0,7,272,CLAIRE,I know... there was just... someone who promised me I wouldn't be here.
0,7,272,CHARLIE,He was wrong. Keep breathing.
0,7,272,CLAIRE,... yeah... he was wrong...
0,7,274,CLAIRE,You've spent the last three months telling me I need to raise the baby myself. Now you're giving me money and saying I don't have to.
0,7,274,MALKIN,I've found a couple in Los Angeles who are very eager to adopt. The baby will be safe in their care. I've foreseen...
0,7,274,CLAIRE,Foreseen? What am I even doing here? I can't believe I'm listening to --
0,7,275,MALKIN,"I know it sounds ridiculous, Claire. All of this... ""psychic"" business. And I appreciate that you must think I'm a madman -- But this is what must happen."
0,7,276,CLAIRE,So you're giving me six-thousand dollars to give my baby to a pair of strangers in Los Angeles.
0,7,276,MALKIN,Twelve-thousand. The other six when you get to Los Angeles. And they're not strangers -- They're good people.
0,7,276,CLAIRE,How do you know I won't just take the six and run?
0,7,276,MALKIN,Because I know your soul. I know your honesty. That if you promise me you'll go... you will.
0,7,278,CHARLIE,A psychic.
0,7,278,CLAIRE,I know. I'm so embarrassed. And after everything... he was just full of it.
0,7,279,CHARLIE,"Or not. All he wanted was that no one else raise your baby, right? ... so maybe he knew."
0,7,280,CHARLIE (CONT'D),"... I mean... if he wanted it bad enough... if that guy really... does have the gift... and I think some people do... ... he could've known, Claire..."
0,7,282,CLAIRE,"I can't leave tomorrow, I need a few days to--"
0,7,282,MALKIN,No. It has to be this flight. It can't be any other. They're already scheduled to meet you when you arrive. Flight 815.
0,7,284,CLAIRE,... there was no couple... in Los Angeles... He knew...
0,7,285,CLAIRE (V.O.),... he knew about the plane... ... he knew what was going to happen...
0,7,286,CLAIRE (V.O.) (CONT'D),"... he knew... oh my God, he knew..."
0,7,295,CHARLIE,You feel another one coming?
0,7,295,CLAIRE,I don't know...
0,7,295,CHARLIE,Where in the bloody hell is Jack?
0,7,296,CLAIRE,I think... I think I'm all right.
0,7,296,CHARLIE,Wait. You shouldn't -- the contractions --
0,7,296,CLAIRE,"Maybe that was the last one. Please, let it have been the last one."
0,7,296,CHARLIE,Jack said the stress might cause some kind of false labor... Are you sure you're all right?
0,7,297,CLAIRE,No pain.
0,7,297,CHARLIE,"Well, there you are, then: Birthing emergency averted. Told you I'd take care of you."
0,7,297,CLAIRE,"Thank you, Charlie."
0,7,297,CHARLIE,... you're quite welcome.
0,7,298,CHARLIE (CONT'D),Any chance of you making it back to the caves? I won't let anything happen to you.
0,7,302,KATE,Sayid?
0,7,304,SAYID,-- Listen -- on the island -- I found her -- the woman -- she --
0,7,305,JACK,I need some water! What happened? Where were --?
0,7,305,SAYID,I had to come back. I had to... We are not alone.
0,7,307,HURLEY,We -- got -- a problem!
0,7,310,HURLEY (CONT'D),The manifest...
0,7,310,JACK,What?
0,7,310,HURLEY,"My census -- the names of-- everyone who survived. All forty- six of us. I interviewed everybody. Here. At the beach. Got everyone's -- name... But one of them -- Jack, one of them isn't in the manifest."
0,7,312,HURLEY (CONT'D),He wasn't on the plane.
0,7,313,KATE,Who wasn't on the plane?
0,7,316,CHARLIE,You okay?
0,7,316,CLAIRE,Yeah -- he just kicked.
0,7,317,VOICE (O.S.),Hello there.
0,7,319,CHARLIE,Ethan? Where's Jack?
0,7,319,ETHAN,Oh. Jack? I didn't go and get him.
0,7,320,CHARLIE,What do you mean you didn't go?
0,7,321,ETHAN,I know you're scared. It's okay.
0,7,321,CHARLIE,"What the hell are you talking about, you git? One more step --"
0,7,324,ETHAN,I'm sorry it's come to this.
0,7,325,THE END,
