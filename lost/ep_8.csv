0,8,3,ETHAN,I know you're scared. It's okay.
0,8,3,CHARLIE,"What the hell are you talking about, you git? One more step --"
0,8,6,ETHAN,I'm sorry it's come to this.
0,8,8,HURLEY (O.S.),He wasn't on the plane.
0,8,10,KATE,Who wasn't on the plane?
0,8,10,HURLEY,That Canadian guy - Ethan - He isn't in the passenger manifest -
0,8,11,JACK HURLEY,Well where is he? -- Don't know -- I talked to him yesterday and --
0,8,11,KATE JACK,Jack -- Sayid... his leg -- -- Anybody seen Ethan?
0,8,11,JACK,Has anyone seen Ethan?
0,8,12,MICHAEL,"Yeah... said he was gonna get wood - took off on the path to the beach. Is he okay, man? What happened --?"
0,8,13,JACK KATE,Where's Charlie? -- What?
0,8,13,JACK,Where's Charlie?
0,8,14,LOCKE,He went after Claire.
0,8,19,LOCKE,Jack.
0,8,23,JACK,She was moving to the beach.
0,8,24,JACK (CONT'D),Claire. It's hers.
0,8,25,JACK (CONT'D),What -- what happened? Where --?
0,8,25,LOCKE,I don't know.
0,8,26,LOCKE (CONT'D),Footprints - at least three discrete sets - they're all over the place - looks like there might have been a struggle -
0,8,27,JACK,What? What is it?
0,8,27,LOCKE,Drag marks. Here... and here.
0,8,27,JACK,Charlie -- he came after her. They were together...
0,8,28,LOCKE,I think they've been taken.
0,8,29,CLAIRE! CHARLIE!,
0,8,29,LOCKE,Jack.
0,8,31,LOCKE (CONT'D),Shhhhhhhhhhh.
0,8,34,LOCKE,The tracks are still fresh.
0,8,34,JACK,It doesn't make any sense -- How could one man drag two people --
0,8,35,LOCKE,You're asking the wrong question. Not how... Why?
0,8,36,JACK,You think it was Ethan?
0,8,36,LOCKE,It certainly feels like it was Ethan.
0,8,37,JACK,By himself? How --?
0,8,37,LOCKE,"We can't account for all of our people -- And more importantly, who's to say they're even our people?"
0,8,38,LOCKE (CONT'D),Sayid said there were others.
0,8,38,JACK,"He said ""we are not alone."""
0,8,39,LOCKE,Semantics.
0,8,39,JACK,Sayid's injured -- we don't know where he went -- he's delerious...
0,8,39,LOCKE,I'm only telling you what the ground is telling me.
0,8,39,JACK,So which way is the ground saying they went?
0,8,40,LOCKE JACK,Jack -- we don't know what's going on here. -- We know enough.
0,8,40,LOCKE,"We need to prepare -- we can be back at the caves in ten minutes -- organize a search party, get weapons --"
0,8,40,JACK,"Which way did they go, Locke?"
0,8,44,JACK'S VOICE (PRE-LAP),Let's get a clamp on that artery so I can ligate above the tear -
0,8,45,JACK,- come on - come on!
0,8,47,ANESTHESIOLOGIST JACK,B.P.'s falling - she's bleeding out... -- No - I got the artery - almost there -
0,8,48,JACK (CONT'D),Let's start CPR...
0,8,48,ANESTHESIOLOGIST JACK,She's in arrest... -- 1 milligram epi - Where's that crash cart!?!
0,8,49,JACK (CONT'D),Artery's sealed - close her up -
0,8,49,ANDREA,D-fib!
0,8,52,ANDREA,We're charged -
0,8,52,JACK,Clear!
0,8,53,JACK (CONT'D),- C'mon -- C'mon back --
0,8,54,JACK (CONT'D),C'mon... Let's go... C'mon back...
0,8,55,MAN,Call it.
0,8,56,MAN (CONT'D),Call it.
0,8,57,MAN (CONT'D),Jack.
0,8,60,SHEPHARD,Call it. It's over.
0,8,65,JACK,You call it.
0,8,66,SHEPHARD,Time of death is 3:23 PM. Per the Chief of Surgery.
0,8,72,KATE,You just let him go? Alone?
0,8,72,LOCKE,Couldn't stop him. Don't worry -- I'll catch up. What's the word from the beach?
0,8,72,KATE,Nothing. Nobody's seen them.
0,8,73,KATE (CONT'D),I'm coming with you.
0,8,73,LOCKE,Figured you might.
0,8,74,SHANNON (O.S.),- What are you doing? We need to get our water and go back to the beach! This isn't our --
0,8,74,BOONE (O.S.),I heard you're forming a search party. Can I help?
0,8,75,SHANNON,Search party? This is a deserted island.
0,8,75,SHA NNON (CONT'D),"No choppers, no Amber alert - how exactly are you going to find them?"
0,8,76,LOCKE,"By following Ethan's trail - - no one can walk through wilderness without leaving signs -- bending blades of grass, breaking twigs -- especially with captives in tow."
0,8,77,LOCKE (CONT'D),"And yes, I could use another hand if you're up for it."
0,8,78,BOONE,I'm up for it.
0,8,79,LOCKE,Then let's get moving.
0,8,82,WALT,"I could take Vincent, you know, he could sniff something that belonged to Charlie and - I can help."
0,8,82,MICHAEL,"I said no, man."
0,8,83,MICHAEL (CONT'D),A lot of us don't want to just sit here waiting for news. We're willing to go out and look too.
0,8,84,LOCKE,"Thanks, but we're set. Anyone else is just going to slow us down."
0,8,84,MICHAEL,Yeah -- Okay -- so maybe I can put together another party...
0,8,84,LOCKE,Good idea. We're going north. I suggest you go south.
0,8,91,SHEPHARD,Never thought I'd see the day.
0,8,92,SHEPHARD (CONT'D),You barge into my OR to work on my patient?
0,8,93,JACK,You didn't have to do the procedure...
0,8,93,SHEPHARD,I don't have to do anything.
0,8,94,SHEPHARD,"I chose to do this procedure -- this emergency procedure -- because when that girl crashed in the E.R., they called me."
0,8,94,JACK,I was upstairs -
0,8,94,SHEPHARD,And you should have stayed there - How did you even know about...
0,8,94,JACK,One of the nurses came to get me.
0,8,95,SHEPHARD,Who?
0,8,96,SHEPHARD (CONT'D),Well. Thank God I have you and some anonymous nurse to rescue me -
0,8,96,JACK,She told me your hands were shaking.
0,8,96,SHEPHARD JACK,"My hands weren't... -- You cut her hepatic artery, she bled out -"
0,8,96,SHEPHARD,She was in a car crash - her insides were a mess -
0,8,97,JACK SHEPHARD,-- You made a mistake. -- They called me. Not you.
0,8,99,JACK,"How many drinks did you have at lunch, dad?"
0,8,101,LOCKE (V.O.),Jack. Jack.
0,8,102,LOCKE (O.S.),"Good thing you've been going in a circle. Not the best search grid, but we might not have found you otherwise."
0,8,103,KATE,You find anything?
0,8,103,JACK,No.
0,8,104,LOCKE,You should get back to the caves. Sayid's leg...
0,8,105,JACK,I dressed Sayid's leg. You found me -- Then we can find Charlie and Claire. So do we have a trail to follow or not?
0,8,105,LOCKE,Jack -- This is my fault.
0,8,105,JACK,What?
0,8,105,LOCKE,I've been hunting with Ethan. Spent time with him. Never sensed anything... Off. For everything I know -- about hunting? Tracking? Whoever he is... he knows more. If we catch up to him -- I don't want anything to happen to the only trained physician on the island. Go back and be the doctor - let me be the hunter.
0,8,106,JACK,Can we go now?
0,8,107,LOCKE,Follow me.
0,8,108,BOONE,Jack.
0,8,111,MICHAEL,"- I'm trying to help and all the guy can tell me is to ""go south."" Like what, I'm gonna get in his way or something?"
0,8,111,HURLEY,"Look, man, everyone's tweaked - Locke's feelin' it just like the rest of us -"
0,8,112,MICHAEL,"So what? I got five other guys who are going out there with me, putting our necks on the line to find Charlie and Claire. All I'm saying is I'm getting sick of being treated like a second- class citizen around here just because Mount Baldy knows how to bag a boar."
0,8,113,WALT,He knows a lot more than how to get a boar. Mr. Locke's a warrior. He knows how to hunt and track and stuff - and he's the only one who brought knives. If he told me to stay out of his way...
0,8,114,WALT (CONT'D),...I'd listen to him.
0,8,114,MICHAEL,Well I don't want you to. Y'understand?
0,8,115,MICHAEL (CONT'D),You stay with Hurley. I might not be a warrior. But I'm going south.
0,8,117,HURLEY,Back home? I'm known as something of a warrior myself.
0,8,119,LOCKE,We keep our progress marked by line of sight -- we tie these off so we don't get lost.
0,8,119,BOONE,"But you can lead us back to camp, right?"
0,8,119,LOCKE,Unless something happens to me.
0,8,120,BOONE,Then maybe I better take marker detail.
0,8,122,JACK,Anything?
0,8,122,LOCKE,Not yet.
0,8,123,JACK,If you can't find the --
0,8,123,LOCKE,I'll pick it up again. But we should rest for a minute. Get our clarity back.
0,8,124,JACK,"You're taking a break? It's four o'clock, man -- if the sun sets there's no way..."
0,8,124,LOCKE,"It's four twenty-five, and yes -- I'm taking a break. Sorry."
0,8,125,KATE,Can I talk to you?
0,8,127,KATE,Would it kill you to give the guy a little bit of space?
0,8,127,JACK,It might.
0,8,127,KATE JACK,Stop that. What?
0,8,127,KATE,That.
0,8,128,KATE (CONT'D),What's going on?
0,8,129,JACK,I didn't believe her. Claire. I gave her a sedative.
0,8,129,KATE,Jack -- You can't...
0,8,129,JACK,She told me someone was coming after her. That she was attacked... and she sounded so... out of it.
0,8,129,JAC K (CONT'D),I thought the pregnancy was amping up her stress. I just -- I didn't believe her.
0,8,132,KATE,What is it?
0,8,138,LOCKE,Look familiar?
0,8,138,JACK,It's Charlie's.
0,8,139,BOONE,What? You think it just... came off?
0,8,139,JACK,No. I think... He's leaving us a trail.
0,8,143,JACK,They went this way.
0,8,145,LOCKE,I'm not so sure. There's another trail here.
0,8,146,JACK,"What do you mean, another --?"
0,8,146,LOCKE,These are footprints. People moved off this way.
0,8,147,JACK,Charlie is leaving us these to follow. They're heading that way.
0,8,148,KATE (O.S.),What if Charlie isn't the one leaving them?
0,8,150,KATE (CONT'D),"If Ethan knows we're behind him, he might be setting up a dummy trail. Take off one way, then double-back in his own footprints."
0,8,151,BOONE,Wait -- Now you're a tracker?
0,8,152,LOCKE,You're just full of surprises.
0,8,153,JACK,"If there are two trails, we split up. I'm taking this one --"
0,8,153,LOCKE,"We should stay together, Jack..."
0,8,153,JACK,Why? We have two trails... And apparently two trackers.
0,8,155,LOCKE,Be careful.
0,8,158,HURLEY,Crap!
0,8,158,WALT HURLEY,"Your blots can't get it. -- Yeah, I know my blots can't get in."
0,8,158,WALT,My roll.
0,8,158,HURLEY,Yahoo.
0,8,158,WALT,"Okay, I need a four-three..."
0,8,159,HURLEY,"Dude, would you please roll?"
0,8,160,HURLEY (CONT'D),No!!
0,8,160,WALT,Your turn.
0,8,161,WALT (CONT'D),It's okay. I wasn't very good when I first started playing either.
0,8,161,HURLEY,I didn't just start playing. I finished 17th at a tournament once!
0,8,161,WALT,17th's not very good.
0,8,162,HURLEY,"No, 17th is very good."
0,8,162,WALT,"If you say so. C'mon, double sixes..."
0,8,163,HURLEY,You gotta be kidding me.
0,8,163,WALT,I'm lucky.
0,8,164,HURLEY,No one is that lucky.
0,8,164,WALT,My Dad said I was the luckiest person he knew.
0,8,164,HURLEY,Really...
0,8,164,WALT,"Not Michael, Brian -- my other Dad..."
0,8,165,WALT (CONT'D),It's kind of a long story.
0,8,168,WALT (CONT'D),"C'mon, one more game -- double or nothing again."
0,8,169,HURLEY,I got a meeting.
0,8,169,WALT,A meeting?
0,8,169,HURLEY,Yeah. A meeting.
0,8,170,WALT,You owe me twenty thousand dollars!
0,8,172,SAWYER,Okay - who got taken by what?
0,8,173,WALT,Charlie and Claire... they think Ethan took them.
0,8,173,SAWYER,Ethan took them.
0,8,173,WALT,Yeah.
0,8,173,SAWYER,Took them why?
0,8,174,SAWYER (CONT'D),And who the hell is Ethan?
0,8,174,WALT,Dunno -- but he wasn't on that list thing. The manifest. People are saying they don't remember him from the plane.
0,8,174,SAWYER,You ever think he might've lied about his name?
0,8,175,WALT,Why would he lie?
0,8,175,SAWYER,You serious?
0,8,175,WALT,It's stupid to lie about your name.
0,8,177,SAWYER,"Allrighty, so where do you think Ethan came from, Tattoo?"
0,8,177,WALT,Maybe he was already here. On the island. Before we...
0,8,177,SAWYER,Got yourself a helluva imagination.
0,8,177,WALT,There could be lots of other people on the island.
0,8,177,SAWYER,"So a tribe of evil natives planted a ringer in the camp to kidnap a pregnant girl and a reject from VH1 has-beens-reunited - yeah, that's fiendishly clever - And why am I getting the evening news from a six year old?"
0,8,178,WALT,I'm ten.
0,8,178,SAWYER,"Okay, then it must be true."
0,8,179,WALT,"If you don't believe me, go ask Sayid. He said we're not alone."
0,8,180,SAWYER,... Sayid's back?
0,8,182,BOONE,Red shirt.
0,8,182,LOCKE,Hmmm?
0,8,182,BOONE,Red shirt. You ever watch Star Trek?
0,8,183,LOCKE,I don't have a television.
0,8,183,BOONE,Oh. You know what it was about?
0,8,183,LOCKE,Sure. Big spaceship. Lasers. Aliens. That sort of thing.
0,8,183,BOONE,"The crew guys who would come down to the planets with the main guys, y'know the Captain and the guy with the pointy ears? They always wore red shirts. And they always got killed."
0,8,183,LOCKE,Huh. I'd say that's one piss-poor Captain.
0,8,184,BOONE,"So what do you do back in the real world, Mr. Locke?"
0,8,184,LOCKE,It's John.
0,8,184,BOONE,John.
0,8,184,LOCKE,Why don't you guess.
0,8,184,BOONE,Okay... I'm gonna go with taxidermist or hit man.
0,8,184,LOCKE,I was Regional Collections Supervisor for a box company.
0,8,184,BOONE,A box company?
0,8,184,LOCKE,They made boxes.
0,8,185,BOONE,"Yeah, right."
0,8,188,KATE,Would you please slow down? Jack?
0,8,189,JACK,You said they went this way...
0,8,189,KATE,I think they went this way. I'm not as good at this as Locke...
0,8,189,JACK,"So when'd you pick up the tracking skills, Kate? Before or after you were on the run?"
0,8,191,KATE,"I'm trying to help, Jack."
0,8,191,JACK,You know what might help? A little honesty. Just give me something real. Anything.
0,8,192,KATE,"My dad was in the Army. Ranger Battalion. We were stationed at Fort Lewis. Washington State. We would go hiking together. One day we spent eight hours tracking deer... being in the woods, that was his religion."
0,8,193,KATE (CONT'D),That was real.
0,8,194,KATE (CONT'D),"Anything you wanna share, Jack?"
0,8,196,JACK,No.
0,8,198,SHEPHARD,"Thanks for coming, Jack. Sit down."
0,8,199,JACK,What's it say?
0,8,199,SHEPHARD,The truth...
0,8,200,SHEPHARD (CONT'D),"... That a patient was brought to the ER following a car accident, rushed into surgery with massive internal bleeding. You joined me -- and in spite of our most heroic efforts -- the patient succumbed to her injuries."
0,8,201,JACK,Looks like you fixed everything but the patient.
0,8,202,JACK (CONT'D),You had no business being in that operating room.
0,8,202,SHEPHARD,You really think I'd have walked in there if I couldn't handle it?
0,8,202,JACK,You've done it before.
0,8,203,SHEPHARD,That's right. I have - and I'm fully capable of making those decisions --
0,8,203,JACK,How can you say that after yesterday?
0,8,203,SHEPHARD JACK,The problem was not related to -- -- You were impaired!
0,8,203,SHEPHARD,I know my limits.
0,8,203,JACK,I won't sign this.
0,8,204,SHEPHARD,You were part of the team. I'm not the only one on the hook for this. You called me off! You were the surgeon of record when she died!
0,8,206,SHEPHARD (CONT'D),"Accidents happen in surgeries all the time, Jack. You know that. That's the truth. But if you contradict this report -- mention alcohol -- well, that's the only fact that will matter. They'll strip me of my license."
0,8,206,JACK,"Yes, they will."
0,8,208,SHEPHARD,I know I've been hard on you.
0,8,209,SHEPHARD (CONT'D),But that's how you make metal into steel. And that's why you're the most gifted young surgeon in this city.
0,8,210,SHEPHARD (CONT'D),"This is a career that's all about the greater good. I've had to sacrifice certain aspects of my relationship with you, so that hundreds..."
0,8,210,SHE PHARD (CONT'D),"thousands of patients will live, will thrive, because of your extraordinary skills."
0,8,212,SHEPHARD (CONT'D),Long time coming. I know.
0,8,213,SHEPHARD (CONT'D),What happened today... I promise you -- it'll never happen again.
0,8,214,SHEPHARD (CONT'D),"What I've given... This isn't just my career, Jack. This is my life."
0,8,216,SHEPHARD (CONT'D),"Thank you, Son."
0,8,218,SAWYER (O.S.),"I don't know if you ""Islams"" have a concept of karma -"
0,8,219,SAWYER (CONT'D),- but I get the sense this island served you up a heaping platter of cosmic payback.
0,8,220,SAYID,What do you want?
0,8,220,SAWYER,"Doctor do-right don't trust me with his antibiotics, so I have to hump here every day to get my meds. Apropos of nothing... a less magnanimous man than I might just be thinking he could beat the ever- loving snot out of you without fear of reprisal."
0,8,220,SAYID,"You want a shot, take it... but know that I left this camp out of shame for what I did to you. It was never my intention to return."
0,8,220,SAWYER,"You cut me up, put bamboo under my nails... Sorry, I'm fresh out of sweet forgiveness. So if it wasn't your intention to return, why did you?"
0,8,221,SAYID,I was taken prisoner by the French woman.
0,8,222,SAWYER,The one that's been sending out the distress signal for sixteen years? ... she's alive?
0,8,222,SAYID,She was on a science expedition... She said they shipwrecked.
0,8,222,SAWYER SAYID,How? Where? -- She didn't say.
0,8,222,SAWYER,She alone?
0,8,222,SAYID,She said that there were others on the island.
0,8,222,SAWYER,Her people?
0,8,222,SAYID,No. She murdered her entire team. She believed they were... sick.
0,8,223,SAWYER SAYID,"Right. And these ""others?"" I don't know. Who the hell are -- She's never seen them."
0,8,223,SAWYER,Never seen them. But she knows they're there.
0,8,223,SAYID,If you believe her.
0,8,223,SAWYER,Do you?
0,8,223,SAYID,"Maybe, maybe not."
0,8,225,SAYID (CONT'D),But on my way back. I heard something in the jungle. Surrounding me.
0,8,225,SAWYER,Something like what?
0,8,226,SAYID,"Do you have something to say to me, Sawyer? Or are you going to continue to ask me questions you know I don't have the answers to?"
0,8,228,SAWYER,"By the way, the tides are comin' up the beach. Plane hull's almost in the water... I kept your signal fire burning."
0,8,230,BOONE,It's been fifteen minutes since we found any sign... what are we following?
0,8,230,LOCKE,"My gut. So, Boone. What do you do in the real world?"
0,8,230,BOONE,I run a business.
0,8,230,LOCKE,What kind of business.
0,8,231,BOONE,It's a... wedding thing.
0,8,231,LOCKE,Huh.
0,8,231,BOONE,"My mother -- she has this... empire. ""The Martha Stewart of Matrimony."" I run one of the subsidiaries."
0,8,231,LOCKE,And who's running it now?
0,8,232,BOONE,"Guess it doesn't matter, does it?"
0,8,232,LOCKE,There are people who can handle it. Temporarily.
0,8,233,LOCKE (CONT'D),Gonna start raining in one minute.
0,8,233,BOONE,One minute?
0,8,233,LOCKE,Give or take a few seconds.
0,8,234,LOCKE (CONT'D),"You should turn around, Boone. Head back."
0,8,234,BOONE,What?
0,8,234,LOCKE,"Trail's been cold for a quarter mile and there's dangerous terrain ahead. If you go now, you'll make it back to camp before dark."
0,8,234,BOONE,What about you --?
0,8,234,LOCKE,I can take care of myself.
0,8,234,BOONE,I'm not heading back.
0,8,234,LOCKE BOONE,"I admire your bravery, but -- -- I'm not heading back."
0,8,235,LOCKE,"All right, then."
0,8,240,JACK,I guess we were right. Where to now?
0,8,252,ANDREA,Dr. Shephard.
0,8,252,JACK,Andrea -- do you know who that man is? That my father's talking to?
0,8,253,ANDREA,That's her husband.
0,8,254,ANDREA (CONT'D),He's threatening to sue.
0,8,263,KATE,This is -- can't be right -- how could they have gone this way?!
0,8,263,JACK,"Just follow me, keep moving!"
0,8,268,KATE,Jack!!
0,8,274,ETHAN,"Hello, Jack."
0,8,276,JACK,Who are you?
0,8,277,ETHAN,Stop. Following. Me.
0,8,277,JACK,Where are they? What did you do with them? What --
0,8,279,ETHAN,You are not understanding... so listen very closely.
0,8,281,ETHAN (CONT'D),"If you do not stop following me, I will kill one of them."
0,8,282,ETHAN (CONT'D),Do you understand?
0,8,292,ETHAN (CONT'D),No more warnings.
0,8,295,KATE'S VOICE,Jack - Jack - please -
0,8,296,KATE JACK,You're bleeding - are you -? -- How... how long was I out?
0,8,296,KATE,Two minutes. You slid away --
0,8,297,JACK,Ethan...
0,8,297,KATE,What?
0,8,298,JACK,Ethan was here. He...
0,8,298,KATE JACK,You banged your head -- -- He was here.
0,8,300,KATE,Jack -- you have to stop.
0,8,300,JACK,What?
0,8,300,KATE,The rain's washed the trail away. Even if you did see him...
0,8,301,KAT E (CONT'D),They're gone.
0,8,302,JACK,No. I'm not letting him do this.
0,8,303,KATE,Not letting him -- ?
0,8,305,JACK,Not again.
0,8,306,SHEPHARD (O.S.),- at which time the patient went into cardiac arrest -
0,8,308,SHEPHARD,"- of course, every effort was made to resuscitate the patient - but the severity of her injuries and the amount of internal bleeding made it impossible."
0,8,309,SHEPHARD (CONT'D),"In my professional opinion -- and that's all I've got, gentlemen... By the time I was called in, the damage was irreversible."
0,8,311,HEAD DOCTOR,"Thanks, Christian. Sorry about the formality."
0,8,311,SHEPHARD,Of course.
0,8,313,HEAD DOCTOR,Just one final detail - you were aware of the patient's pregnancy when you went into the procedure?
0,8,314,SHEPHARD,"Absolutely. The patient's husband informed the attending at the ER. It was, however, extremely early in the pregnancy and our primary focus had to be on the mother."
0,8,317,HEAD DOCTOR,"Okay, then. I think we're done and the final report will be filed --"
0,8,317,JACK (O.S.),I need to revise my statement.
0,8,319,JACK (CONT'D),I didn't come into the OR until well into the procedure.
0,8,319,SHEPHARD,Jack.
0,8,319,JACK,I was warned by one of the nurses that my father was operating under the influence -
0,8,319,SHEPHARD,Jack. This is not--
0,8,319,JACK,"By the time I got there it was clear that my father was not only incapacitated, but that he severed the patient's hepatic artery, which in my professional opinion, caused the crisis that led to her death."
0,8,329,JACK,You have to cut the noose.
0,8,330,KATE,- I can't reach it -
0,8,330,JACK,- hold him -
0,8,332,JACK (CONT'D),You have to cut the rope from the tree - go!
0,8,334,JACK,"Just hold on, Charlie - hold on!"
0,8,342,JACK (CONT'D),He's not breathing.
0,8,347,JACK (CONT'D),Come on... come on...
0,8,351,JACK (CONT'D),Come on -- Breathe... COME IN!
0,8,352,KATE,He's... He's not --
0,8,359,KATE (CONT'D),Jack...
0,8,368,WALT,That's never going to look like a hat.
0,8,368,HURLEY,Who says it's a hat?
0,8,369,WALT,Dad!
0,8,372,MICHAEL,"We didn't find them, Walt."
0,8,372,WALT,I'm just... Glad you're okay.
0,8,373,MICHAEL,We the only ones back?
0,8,376,WALT,He hasn't said anything since he came back.
0,8,376,MICHAEL,Did they find Claire?
0,8,378,SHANNON (O.S.),They aren't back yet.
0,8,379,KATE,"I'm sure they just made camp for the night. If there's anyone on this island that your brother's gonna be safe with, it's Locke."
0,8,382,BOONE,Are we lost?
0,8,382,LOCKE,"No, Boone. We're not lost."
0,8,382,BOONE,It's just... I don't see how you can still be following the trail.
0,8,383,BOONE (CONT'D),"I think we should go back, man."
0,8,386,LOCKE,Don't you feel it?
0,8,386,BOONE,Feel what?
0,8,386,LOCKE,It.
0,8,387,BOONE,"Okay, John -- I'm just gonna follow the strips back, okay?"
0,8,388,LOCKE,Suit yourself.
0,8,389,LOCKE (CONT'D),Boone! You need this more than I do.
0,8,392,BOONE,Dammit!
0,8,395,BOONE (CONT'D),Hey... John?
0,8,396,BOONE (CONT'D),What is it?
0,8,398,LOCKE,Steel.
0,8,398,BOONE,Maybe it's wreckage -- part of our plane...
0,8,401,BOONE (CONT'D),What is that?
0,8,402,LOCKE,That's what we're going to find out.
0,8,404,JACK,That hurt?
0,8,405,JACK (CONT'D),You breathing okay?
0,8,406,JACK (CONT'D),"Charlie -- You've gotta talk to me. We're gonna go back out to look for Claire the moment the sun's back up, so we need your help, man -- -- anything you can tell us about what you remember... where you were going -- did you see or hear --?"
0,8,407,CHARLIE,I didn't see anything. Hear
0,8,409,CHARLIE (CONT'D),Claire.
0,8,409,JACK,What?
0,8,409,CHARLIE,That's all they wanted.
0,8,409,JACK,They? I don't --
0,8,410,CHARLIE,All they wanted was Claire.
0,8,411,JACK (CONT'D),You breathing okay?
0,8,412,JACK (CONT'D),"Charlie -- You've gotta talk to me. We're gonna go back out to look for Claire the moment the sun's back up, so we need your help, man -- -- anything you can tell us about what you remember... where you were going -- did you see or hear --?"
0,8,413,CHARLIE,I didn't see anything. Hear anything. I don't remember... Anything.
0,8,414,CHARLIE (CONT'D),Claire.
0,8,414,JACK,What?
0,8,414,CHARLIE,That's all he wanted.
0,8,414,JACK,I don't --
0,8,416,THE END,
