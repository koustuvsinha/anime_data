0,9,2,HURLEY,So... Jack.
0,9,2,JACK,So... Hurley.
0,9,2,HURLEY,Something... kinda important I been meaning to ask ya about... Anything I tell you... it's Doctor/Patient stuff -- confidential right?
0,9,3,HURLEY (CONT'D),Okay -- Thing is? I haven't really been feeling too great...
0,9,3,JACK,What's the matter?
0,9,3,HURLEY,It's sort of like... my stomach? I've got some major... digestive problems...
0,9,4,JACK,What have you been eating?
0,9,4,HURLEY,Just some bananas... mangos... papayas... guavas... passion fruit... coconut... ...and some of those weird star fruit from up on the hill. Someone said they were good for digestion. But lemme tell ya... they lied.
0,9,4,JACK,It might help if you had some more protein in your diet.
0,9,4,HURLEY,"Dude... What can I do? There's no boar. No boar, no protein."
0,9,4,JACK,You can eat fish. Jin's catching a lot of `em.
0,9,4,HURLEY,That guy has it in for me. No way.
0,9,5,JACK,"C'mon, Hurley --"
0,9,5,HURLEY,I'm not kidding. He offered me something to eat right after we -- you know -- got here. The thing with the spikes.
0,9,5,JACK,Sea urchin.
0,9,5,HURLEY,"Yeah, sea urchin. I turn him down and it's like I soiled his family honor or something. He hasn't looked me in the eye since. Guy holds some kinda serious grudge."
0,9,6,JACK,"You're not eating those, are you...?"
0,9,6,HURLEY,Dude. These are not for eating.
0,9,7,HURLEY (CONT'D),Excuse me.
0,9,11,KATE,"I see you there, y'know."
0,9,12,JACK,I wasn't hiding.
0,9,13,JACK (CONT'D),I just didn't want to disturb you from doing... whatever it is you're doing...
0,9,13,KATE,It's not like it's a secret.
0,9,13,JACK,Hard to tell with you.
0,9,14,JACK (CONT'D),"Oh, gross little greyish yellow things."
0,9,14,KATE,Passion fruit seeds.
0,9,14,JACK,What are those for?
0,9,14,KATE,I'll show you... if you wanna see.
0,9,15,KATE (CONT'D),Follow me...
0,9,17,JACK,Please tell me you found a coffee bar.
0,9,17,KATE,Not quite.
0,9,20,JACK,Wow... When did you do this?
0,9,20,KATE,I didn't. It's all Sun. I wandered into this place yesterday when I was out picking fruit.
0,9,20,JACK,This is beautiful. It's great.
0,9,20,KATE,She's got herbs and some lowgrowing stuff over here. And she's... starting a grove over there...
0,9,22,JACK,"This is smart. With the boar running out, we're gonna need all the food we can get."
0,9,22,KATE,Maybe it's not running out.
0,9,22,JACK,What do you mean?
0,9,22,KATE,Maybe Locke's just decided not to catch `em for us anymore.
0,9,23,JACK,Why would he do that?
0,9,23,KATE,"Lotta mouths to feed. If the boar's thinning out, why should he feed everyone else at his own expense."
0,9,24,JACK,"You've got yourself some trust issues there, don't you, Kate?"
0,9,25,KATE,"Yup. And in a few weeks, I'll have trust issues and lettuce."
0,9,27,BOONE,I think it's cement.
0,9,29,BOONE (CONT'D),What is that?
0,9,29,LOCKE,Hmmm?
0,9,29,BOONE,In the bowl? What is that stuff?
0,9,29,LOCKE,It's for later.
0,9,30,BOONE,So... not to be difficult or anything but... we've been coming out here for two days and... just staring at this thing. I don't get what we're supposed to be doing.
0,9,30,LOCKE,Ludovico Buonaratti.
0,9,30,BOONE,What?
0,9,30,LOCKE,Michelangelo's father. He was a wealthy man who had no understanding of the divinity in his son. So he beat him. No child of his was going to use his hands for a living. So Michelangelo learned not to use his hands.
0,9,31,LOCKE (CONT'D),"Years later, a visiting prince came into Michelangelo's studio to find the Master staring at a single eighteen foot block of marble. The rumors he had heard were true -- that Michelangelo had come in every day for the past four months, stared at the marble, then gone home for supper. So the prince"
0,9,33,LOCKE (CONT'D),Three years later that marble block was the statue of David.
0,9,34,BOONE,"...you're not... we're not gonna stare at this thing for four months, are we? How are we gonna open it?"
0,9,35,LOCKE,That's what we need to figure out. That's why we're sitting here.
0,9,36,LOCKE (CONT'D),Because... how do you open a hatch that has no handle. No latch. No discernible way of opening it?
0,9,37,BOONE,Maybe we should just knock.
0,9,40,BRYAN,Yeah?
0,9,40,BOONE,I'm looking for Shannon...
0,9,40,BRYAN,And you are?
0,9,40,BOONE,Her brother.
0,9,41,SHANNON,Boone...?
0,9,42,BOONE,Shannon? What's going on...?
0,9,42,SHANNON,What do you mean?
0,9,43,SHANNON (CONT'D),What are you doing here?
0,9,44,BOONE,"Fifteen hours. I was on a plane for fifteen hours. ""Good to see"
0,9,44,BOONE (CONT'D),"you"", ""happy you're here"". How about something like that?"
0,9,44,SHANNON BOONE,I'm just surprised -- You're surprised? How are you -- You told me to --
0,9,45,SHANNON,"Listen, this isn't the best time. Bryan and I, we're on our way out to meet some friends, and we're already like forty-five minutes late..."
0,9,46,SHANNON (CONT'D),Why don't you call me tomorrow?
0,9,47,SHANNON (CONT'D),Please.
0,9,48,BOONE,...'kay. Enjoy your dinner.
0,9,49,HURLEY,"Jin! Yo, Jin! Alto!"
0,9,50,HURLEY (CONT'D),Look. I know you don't like me. `Cause of that sea urchin thing.
0,9,51,HURLEY (CONT'D),"And that's okay, dude. Because I'm not asking for favors or anything. I just need to know -- where do you get the fish? Just point me in the right direction. I'll take care of my own business, with my own tools."
0,9,53,JIN,I have no time for amateurs. Just stay out of my way. Beat.
0,9,53,HURLEY,"You just said something mean, didn't you?"
0,9,55,BOONE,We've got to tell them.
0,9,55,LOCKE,Tell them what?
0,9,55,BOONE,
0,9,57,BOONE (CONT'D),They aren't going to keep believing we're out here hunting if we never come back with anything.
0,9,57,LOCKE,They're not ready.
0,9,57,BOONE,But -- I mean -- why not?
0,9,57,LOCKE,Because they won't understand it.
0,9,57,BOONE,...I'm not sure I understand it.
0,9,57,LOCKE,That's the problem.
0,9,58,BOONE,"Look, at least I need to say something to Shannon."
0,9,58,LOCKE,Why?
0,9,58,BOONE LOCKE,"What do you mean ""why?"" She's my -- -- Why do you care about her so much?"
0,9,59,BOONE,"You don't... She's not always... You don't know her, man."
0,9,60,LOCKE,Fair enough.
0,9,60,BOONE,She's been asking me what we're doing out here. I can't keep lying to her.
0,9,60,LOCKE,You can't keep lying to her? Or you can't stand the way she makes you feel because you're lying to her?
0,9,60,BOONE,"Both. Whatever. Look, she can keep a secret."
0,9,60,LOCKE,You're sure?
0,9,60,BOONE,"Yeah, for sure--"
0,9,60,LOCKE,"No, I mean are you sure you want to do this?"
0,9,60,BOONE,I need to get her off my back. She keeps bugging me about this -- about you -- about this whole thing.
0,9,61,LOCKE,You sure you've thought through the ramifications...?
0,9,61,BOONE,Yeah.
0,9,61,LOCKE,Then so be it.
0,9,66,BOONE,What th--?
0,9,67,BOONE (CONT'D),Locke! LOCKE!
0,9,68,BOONE (CONT'D),What is this? What are you--
0,9,69,BOONE (CONT'D),"-- hey! D'you hear me? Look at me! Hey, you untie my right now!"
0,9,70,LOCKE,Or what?
0,9,71,BOONE,"Look, I promise -- I swear --"
0,9,72,BOONE (CONT'D),I won't tell anyone about that -- hatch thing -- okay?
0,9,73,LOCKE,"I'm doing this, Boone, because it's time for you to let go of some things. Because it's what's best for you. And I promise -- You're gonna thank me for this later."
0,9,74,BOONE,"Hey, you know what...? I don't think this is best for me."
0,9,75,BOONE (CONT'D),What is that stuff? -- What are you doing?!
0,9,75,LOCKE,"An open wound out here? Without treatment, it's gonna get infected."
0,9,76,BOONE,"What the hell are you talking about, man? You're not leaving me out here?!"
0,9,76,LOCKE,Whether you stay is up to you.
0,9,77,LOCKE (CONT'D),The camp is four miles due west.
0,9,77,BOONE,What -- West? Which way is west?!?
0,9,79,BOONE (CONT'D),Hey! HEY!! Locke!
0,9,80,LOCKE,You'll be able to cut yourself free. Once you have the proper motivation.
0,9,83,BOONE,Agghhh!!
0,9,91,LOCKE,Hi.
0,9,91,SAYID,Locke. I... didn't hear you.
0,9,91,LOCKE,Sorry -- sneakier than I give myself credit for.
0,9,92,SAYID,What are you doing out here?
0,9,92,LOCKE,Hunting.
0,9,93,LOCKE (CONT'D),Left my knife with Boone. He thought I should take the afternoon off.
0,9,93,SAYID,Boone. Is hunting.
0,9,93,LOCKE,Boy's eager to learn.
0,9,93,SAYID,You think he'll catch anything?
0,9,93,LOCKE,Nope.
0,9,94,LOCKE (CONT'D),"And what are you doing out here, Sayid?"
0,9,94,SAYID LOCKE,"Orienteering. I'm trying to make something of Rousseau's maps, but -- -- There's nothing to make?"
0,9,94,SAYID,Exactly.
0,9,95,LOCKE,You made a compass. I haven't seen one of these since I was a Webelo.
0,9,96,SAYID,"What's a ""Webelo?"""
0,9,96,LOCKE,Half way between a Cub Scout and a Boy Scout.
0,9,96,SAYID,And what does a Webelo do?
0,9,96,LOCKE,Gets badges mostly. Tying knots. Identifying birds. I wasn't the most popular kid.
0,9,97,LOCKE (CONT'D),Well. I'll leave you to it. Oh -- Here...
0,9,99,LOCKE (CONT'D),Maybe this'll help your cause.
0,9,100,SAYID,Don't you need this?
0,9,101,LOCKE,Not anymore.
0,9,105,MALCOLM,"Sorry, Mr. Carlyle... but I'm afraid I can't help you."
0,9,106,BOONE,"What do you mean, you can't help me?!"
0,9,106,MALCOLM BOONE,"Unfortunately, sir, we need a little more to go on. --I don't understand! I'm reporting a crime here."
0,9,107,BOONE (CONT'D),"Look, this is a cycle with her. My sister is attracted to the wrong kind of guy."
0,9,109,SAWYER,It was his bottle -- I just gave it back to `im!
0,9,110,SAWYER (CONT'D),"Yo, Croc Hunter -- how come nobody wants to hear my side of the story?!"
0,9,112,MALCOLM,"Now if that was her mate, see then I could help you. All right, let me finish taking down your information. You were saying she's your sister... Then why is her name Rutherford and yours Carlyle, is she married?"
0,9,113,BOONE,She was... ...but she's not married anymore -- and that has nothing to do with this.
0,9,114,BOONE (CONT'D),Rutherford was her dad's name. Our parents got married when I was ten and she was eight.
0,9,114,MALCOLM,So she's your step sister.
0,9,114,BOONE,"That's right. Maybe you've heard of my mother, Sabrina Carlyle? She's got the largest wedding business in the US -- and I'm C.O.O. of the wedding clothing subsidiary."
0,9,115,MALCOLM,Would you like to buy my wife's wedding dress? Cost two thousand dollars new and was only worn once.
0,9,116,BOONE,"I just want somebody to pay this guy a visit, that's all."
0,9,116,MALCOLM,"Mr. Carlyle, in the absence of physical evidence or a direct complaint from --"
0,9,117,BOONE,--Shannon--
0,9,117,MALCOLM,"--Shannon-- we can't just go barging into people's apartments. Sadly, we're the police but not the dating police."
0,9,120,BOONE,Bryan. We need to talk.
0,9,121,BRYAN,And you are?...
0,9,121,BOONE,Shannon's brother. Boone.
0,9,121,BRYAN,"Oh, right..."
0,9,122,BOONE,I won't waste your time. Or mine. I want you to break up with my sister.
0,9,122,BRYAN,What?...
0,9,122,BOONE,I want you to end it. Now. Today.
0,9,123,BRYAN,"Bugger off, mate."
0,9,124,BOONE,"What you don't understand, Bryan, is that you'll be the third guy I've paid to leave. You go to her house when she's not there, you get all your stuff, and you never have contact with her again. Understood?"
0,9,124,BRYAN,You flew all the way over here... to bribe me? I mean really-- What are you doing?! Shannon's a grown woman --
0,9,124,BOONE,And I'm going to give you twenty five thousand U.S. dollars.
0,9,125,BRYAN,I love her.
0,9,125,BOONE,How much?
0,9,126,BRYAN,My love for her...? Worth closer to fifty thousand.
0,9,130,BOONE,Who is that?!
0,9,130,SHANNON (V.O.),Boone?!
0,9,130,BOONE,Shannon!
0,9,131,BOONE (CONT'D),I'm tied up!!
0,9,131,SHANNON (V.O.),What?!
0,9,131,BOONE,Can you get over here and --
0,9,131,SHANNON,-- What? I'm tied up too!
0,9,135,BOONE,"Hang on, Shannon, I'm coming!"
0,9,141,BOONE,Eeeggghhhwwhhh!
0,9,142,BOONE (CONT'D),Agghhh!!
0,9,144,BOONE,Shannon! Shannon!!
0,9,146,SHANNON BOONE,Boone -- thank God -- -- Get me out of here -- I'm working on it -- he -- please -- how did --
0,9,147,SHANNON,Oh my god --
0,9,148,SHANNON BOONE,"Hurry, Boone! Please... Almost... done -- There! Let's go!"
0,9,154,BOONE,C'mon!
0,9,155,SHANNON,What are you doing?
0,9,156,SHANNON (CONT'D),We have to run!
0,9,157,BOONE,Shut up! In here.
0,9,164,SHANNON,I thought you were coming -- d'you have any bags? Are later-- you taking anything--?
0,9,164,SHANNON,-- you should come back --
0,9,164,BOONE,Shannon. We're getting out of this country: are you taking anything with you?
0,9,165,BOONE (CONT'D),-- what the hell's going on?
0,9,165,SHANNON,You were supposed to come later.
0,9,165,BOONE,"I'm not gonna sit in my hotel room all day, let's do this, let's go."
0,9,167,BRYAN,Oh... look at this.
0,9,167,BOONE,Let's go.
0,9,168,BOONE (CONT'D),...it's okay. We can go.
0,9,169,BRYAN,"Hey, mate, you don't get this yet? What's what?"
0,9,172,BOONE,This whole thing...? This was a set-up...?
0,9,172,BRYAN,"Don't get all bent, brother. She's just getting what she's owed."
0,9,173,BOONE,-- what'd you say?!
0,9,173,BRYAN,She told me your mum cut her off after her daddy died. Kept all of her father's money for herself. Screwed over Shannon and used it to start her business. Sweet mum you got there. I reckon this is just fair recompense. Wouldn't you agree?
0,9,174,BOONE,"-- this isn't the first time, is it? You've done this to me before, you little bitch--"
0,9,175,BRYAN,That's enough.
0,9,176,BOONE,"-- don't touch me, you lowlife piece of--"
0,9,177,SHANNON,Stop it! BRYAN! GET OFF HIM!!!
0,9,183,SAYID,Which way do you think North is?
0,9,184,JACK,Sorry?
0,9,184,SAYID,North. Which way?
0,9,185,JACK,"Okay. Sun's gonna set over there, so that'd be west. That makes North..."
0,9,187,SAYID,Correct. That is where North should be...
0,9,189,SAYID (CONT'D),Yet that is North.
0,9,189,JACK,I'm not --?
0,9,189,SAYID,-- A minor magnetic anomaly might explain a variance of two or three degrees. Not this.
0,9,190,JACK,"What're you saying, Sayid?"
0,9,190,SAYID,I am saying... This compass is obviously defective.
0,9,190,JACK,Where'd you get it? The compass?
0,9,190,SAYID,Locke gave it to me this afternoon.
0,9,190,JACK,Locke? Where'd you see him?
0,9,190,SAYID,About a mile East of here -- walking through the jungle. At least I think it's East.
0,9,192,SHANNON,Can we please get out of here?
0,9,192,BOONE,
0,9,193,SHANNON,What did you do to him?
0,9,193,BOONE,What did I do to who?
0,9,193,SHANNON,Locke. What did you do to that psycho to piss him off?
0,9,194,BOONE,I didn't do anything.
0,9,194,SHANNON,Oh -- so he did it because he was bored? Why us? Why me? I know you and him are --
0,9,194,BOONE,Let's just get back to camp.
0,9,195,SHANNON,"Uh, scoutmaster? The path's over here."
0,9,195,BOONE,What path?! There is no path.
0,9,197,SHANNON,Oh my God...
0,9,201,JACK,Any ships?
0,9,201,LOCKE,Not yet. But I'm patient.
0,9,201,JACK,Mind if I join you?
0,9,201,LOCKE,Please...
0,9,202,JACK,"Been awhile since you and I talked, John."
0,9,202,LOCKE,Well... you're a busy man.
0,9,202,JACK,So are you.
0,9,203,JACK (CONT'D),Where's Boone?
0,9,203,LOCKE,Haven't seen him today.
0,9,203,JACK,Yeah? You two have been attached to the hip all week.
0,9,204,LOCKE,"Well let me check my hip, then. Nope. No Boone."
0,9,205,JACK,How's the hunting going?
0,9,205,LOCKE,Between you and me?
0,9,205,JACK,Always.
0,9,205,LOCKE,The boar are learning out tactics. I fear they're migrating outside our valley. They're smart animals. And smart animals adapt quickly when a new predator is introduced into their environment.
0,9,205,JACK,You mean us.
0,9,206,LOCKE,The most dangerous predator of all.
0,9,209,HURLEY,Dammit!
0,9,211,JIN,Don't eat my fish!
0,9,212,HURLEY,"Hey, you know what? You win, okay? You happy now? Keep your damn fish. I'm outta h--"
0,9,214,HURLEY (CONT'D),
0,9,215,JIN,What did you do?
0,9,215,HURLEY,I stepped on one of those damn friggin' URCHINS!
0,9,216,HURLEY (CONT'D),"No? You understand infection? Gangrene? AMPUTATION? Oh -- hell -- look man -- you gotta do something -- you don't want to give me fish, that's fine, but -- -- You gotta pee on my foot -- OK? I saw it on TV -- it'll stop the venom -- you gotta --"
0,9,216,JIN,Just pull out the spines -- pull them out --
0,9,217,HURLEY JIN,"No -- you idiot -- that isn't Would you JUST do it? I'm going to do anything! That's gonna lose my foot if you for jellyfish stings! don't! PEE ON IT, MAN!"
0,9,218,JIN (CONT'D),No. No. No.
0,9,221,KATE,Well this is nice. Just us girls.
0,9,222,KATE (CONT'D),Can you believe we've been here over three weeks? I was heading for Bali. I... travel a lot. I was looking forward to spending some time exploring the island. But I ended up on a plane to LA instead. Guess this falls into the category of be careful what you wish for.
0,9,223,KATE (CONT'D),...you understood me...
0,9,224,KATE (CONT'D),"-- you did, didn't you?... You just understood what I said."
0,9,225,KATE (CONT'D),You speak English?
0,9,226,SUN,Please. Don't tell anyone.
0,9,227,HURLEY,You sure you don't speak English?
0,9,228,HURLEY (CONT'D),`Cause there's a rumor that you do.
0,9,229,HURLEY (CONT'D),Your wife is hot.
0,9,230,HURLEY (CONT'D),"I get it, this is some kind of payback `cause I wouldn't eat urchin that other time, right?"
0,9,231,JIN,Here. Please.
0,9,232,HURLEY,I eat this... you give me fish... right?
0,9,233,HURLEY (CONT'D),Okay. Fine.
0,9,234,HURLEY (CONT'D),"Over the lips and past the gums, yada, yada -- oh god! --"
0,9,237,HURLEY (CONT'D),Ohhhhh.
0,9,239,SHANNON,Are you sure we're going in the right direction?
0,9,239,BOONE,"You don't want to follow me, then don't."
0,9,239,SHANNON,I wouldn't have to follow you if you weren't best friends with the
0,9,241,SHANNON (CONT'D),"You and Locke weren't hunting, were you? You were doing something else."
0,9,241,BOONE,Haven't we been over this?
0,9,241,SHANNON,"You're a horrible liar, Boone."
0,9,241,BOONE SHANNON,We weren't doing -- -- Why are you keeping a secret for this guy!
0,9,242,BOONE,"You know who ""this guy"" is? He's the one person here who has a real clue what's going on."
0,9,242,SHANNON BOONE,...the hell does that mean? -- It means he's smart.
0,9,242,SHANNON,"He tied us up, Boone!"
0,9,243,SHANNON (CONT'D),Why?
0,9,243,BOONE,We found something.
0,9,243,SHANNON,What?
0,9,244,BOONE,While we were out looking for Claire... we found this... this piece of metal. Buried in the jungle. We've been excavating it --
0,9,244,SHANNON,A piece of metal?
0,9,244,BOONE,A hatch. Buried in the dirt.
0,9,244,SHANNON,...like... like a door?
0,9,244,BOONE,"Yeah. That's what a hatch is, Shannon--"
0,9,244,SHANNON,Where does it go?
0,9,245,BOONE,I don't know. I told him I wanted to tell you. That's when he did this--
0,9,247,BOONE (CONT'D),-- go!
0,9,252,BOONE,Shannon!!
0,9,253,KATE,Does anybody else know?
0,9,253,SUN,Only Michael.
0,9,253,KATE,But not your husband.
0,9,254,SUN,Please...
0,9,255,KATE,"Don't worry, I can keep a secret."
0,9,256,SUN,I took English lessons in Korea. He doesn't know. It's... complicated.
0,9,257,KATE,Why don't you tell him now?
0,9,257,SUN,I can't.
0,9,257,KATE,Why?
0,9,258,SUN,Because I love him.
0,9,258,KATE,I don't understand.
0,9,259,SUN,Have you never lied to a man you've loved...?
0,9,261,CHARLIE,Cheers.
0,9,262,JACK,Give you a hand?
0,9,262,CHARLIE,Love one.
0,9,263,JACK,Haven't seen you around the caves lately.
0,9,263,CHARLIE,Yeah. Needed a change of scenery.
0,9,264,JACK,"How you doing, Charlie?"
0,9,264,CHARLIE,How am I doing with week two of heroin withdrawal or how am I doing with Claire being abducted by the freak who tried to kill me?
0,9,265,JACK,I gave you the aspirin for the heroin withdrawal.
0,9,268,JACK (CONT'D),What do you think his story is?
0,9,268,CHARLIE,Who? Locke?
0,9,269,CHARLIE (CONT'D),"That man's a freak of nature. Very disturbed. Quite likely murdered all his mates at the Post Office that day his mum forgot to put a cookie in his lunch tin. That was my first impression, anyway. But then he saved my life."
0,9,270,CHARLIE (CONT'D),Another story for another time.
0,9,270,JACK,You trust him?
0,9,271,CHARLIE,"Trust him? No offense, friend... but if there was one person on this island I'd put my absolute faith in to save us all, it'd be John Locke."
0,9,274,HURLEY (O.S.),Found your bag? That's pretty awesome...
0,9,277,HURLEY (CONT'D),...must be nice using your own toothbrush again.
0,9,277,MICHAEL,You got some papaya there?
0,9,277,HURLEY,Yeah. Yippee.
0,9,277,MICHAEL,Mind if I --
0,9,278,HURLEY,"Knock yourself out, dude. Hey, you want to wish something on your worst enemy? Hope they step on a sea urchin."
0,9,280,HURLEY (CONT'D),Whoa. Hey. Thanks...
0,9,282,HURLEY (CONT'D),"Dude, this has already been cleaned? You're kidding me..."
0,9,286,JACK (O.S.),They look happy.
0,9,287,KATE,Happy?
0,9,287,JACK,"Yeah, you remember happy, right?"
0,9,288,JACK (CONT'D),Put out your hand.
0,9,288,KATE,My hand?
0,9,288,JACK,You'll like it. I swear.
0,9,292,KATE,Gross little greyish yellow thingies?
0,9,292,JACK,Excuse me -- these are slimy little blue-black thingies.
0,9,292,KATE,Guava seeds?
0,9,292,JACK,What's a garden without guava?
0,9,292,KATE,A question I've been asking myself forever. Thanks.
0,9,294,BOONE,Shannon?!
0,9,295,BOONE (CONT'D),
0,9,300,BOONE,What do you want?
0,9,301,SHANNON,Bryan took the money.
0,9,301,BOONE,What? --
0,9,301,SHANNON,He's gone.
0,9,302,BOONE,"So the player got played. That's poetic, don't you think?"
0,9,303,SHANNON,It's all your fault.
0,9,304,BOONE,Well that's perfect.
0,9,304,SHANNON,I knew you'd bring the money. I knew you would.
0,9,304,BOONE,"You're drunk, Shannon..."
0,9,304,SHANNON,And you wanna know why?
0,9,304,BOONE,Does it matter? Because I'm sure you're gonna tell me.
0,9,305,SHANNON,Because you're in love with me.
0,9,306,BOONE,What?
0,9,307,SHANNON,You brought the money because you're in love with me.
0,9,308,BOONE SHANNON,You show up here plastered -- you've always been a self- -- I know you're in love with centered bitch -- but now me. you're delusional --
0,9,309,SHANNON (CONT'D),I've always known it.
0,9,310,BOONE,You're sick.
0,9,311,SHANNON,No...
0,9,311,BOONE,Stay away from me...
0,9,311,SHANNON,It's all right...
0,9,311,BOONE,-- the hell are you doing? Get away from me --
0,9,312,BOONE (CONT'D),-- Shannon... ... stop it.
0,9,317,SHANNON,When we get back to LA... you should just tell your mom that... that you rescued me. Again. Just like you always do -- and we just go back --
0,9,317,BOONE,-- to what?
0,9,317,SHANNON,To what it was.
0,9,317,BOONE SHANNON,How could you -- Like this.
0,9,318,BOONE,Like it's all up to you?
0,9,319,SHANNON,Get dressed.
0,9,323,BOONE,-- oh God...
0,9,324,SHANNON,Boone...?
0,9,325,BOONE,I'm here.
0,9,326,SHANNON,I knew you'd come for me... you always come for me...
0,9,327,BOONE,I'm gonna get you back to camp. You're gonna be fine. Jack's gonna take care of you...
0,9,328,SHANNON,"Help me, Boone..."
0,9,334,BOONE,It killed her!
0,9,334,LOCKE,You made it back.
0,9,334,BOONE,That thing out there killed my sister! It's your fault! You dragged her out there!
0,9,334,LOCKE,Your sister?
0,9,334,BOONE LOCKE,"Don't play dumb with me -- I know what you did to her you -- Calm down, son. Just -- sick freak --"
0,9,334,BOONE,And now she's dead. It... it mangled her. She died in my arms.
0,9,335,LOCKE,Then why isn't there blood on you?
0,9,337,BOONE,What happened to me out there?
0,9,337,LOCKE,I don't know. You tell me. But your sister? Shannon?
0,9,340,BOONE,She was dead...
0,9,340,LOCKE,Is that what it made you see?
0,9,340,BOONE,What what made me see? That stuff you put on my head? -- You drugged me?
0,9,340,LOCKE,I gave you an experience.
0,9,340,LOC KE (CONT'D),One I believe vital to your survival on the island.
0,9,340,BOONE,None of it was real? That... thing...
0,9,340,LOCKE,Was only as real as you made it.
0,9,340,BOONE,I saw her die...
0,9,342,LOCKE,How did you feel -- when she died?
0,9,343,LOCKE (CONT'D),... how did you feel...?
0,9,344,BOONE,
0,9,345,LOCKE,Yes.
0,9,346,LOCKE (CONT'D),Time to let go.
0,9,347,LOCKE (CONT'D),Follow me.
