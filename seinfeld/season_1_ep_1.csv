1,1,18,ELAINE,Y'know what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamela's
1,1,19,JERRY,Pamela? Do I know her?
1,1,19,ELAINE,"Yeah, you met her when we were going out."
1,1,19,JERRY,"Oh yeah, right..."
1,1,19,ELAINE,"You have *no* idea who I'm talking about, do you?"

1,1,20,JERRY,Riverside Drive.
1,1,20,ELAINE,"Right! In fact... No, never mind..."

1,1,20,ELAINE,"Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some"
1,1,21,JERRY,"Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here."
1,1,21,ELAINE,What little deal?
1,1,21,JERRY,"I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I"
1,1,22,ELAINE,"A *wedding*!? Have you *lost* it, man?"
1,1,22,JERRY,"Y'know, my parents are coming in for this..."
1,1,22,ELAINE,They're coming in?
1,1,22,JERRY,"Yeah, tomorrow."
1,1,22,ELAINE,"Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?"
1,1,22,JERRY,"No, no... Still doin' the big *sweep* across."
1,1,22,ELAINE,Why does he do that?
1,1,22,JERRY,Doesn't think anyone can tell?
1,1,22,JERRY,"So c'mon, do we have a deal?"
1,1,22,ELAINE,A *wedding*?
1,1,22,JERRY,There's a lot of people to mock...
1,1,22,ELAINE,"Alright, what the Hell."
1,1,22,JERRY,Great!
1,1,22,WOMAN,"When you're dead, you're dead. That's it. You're not goin'"
1,1,23,ELAINE,"C'mon lets go, c'mon..."
1,1,23,JERRY,Was I supposed to bring something?
1,1,23,ELAINE,You could have.
1,1,23,JERRY,I met her *one* time...
1,1,23,ELAINE,It is not necessary.
1,1,23,JERRY,What did you say then?
1,1,23,ELAINE,Sssshhhhhh!!!
1,1,23,PAMELA,Hi
1,1,23,ELAINE,"Hi Pamela, you remember Jerry."
1,1,23,PAMELA,"Yes, we met."
1,1,23,JERRY,"Hi, happy birthday."
1,1,23,PAMELA,"Ahh, everybody, this is Elaine and Jerry."
1,1,23,GUESTS,Hi
1,1,23,JERRY,I didn't bring anything.
1,1,23,PAMELA,"Ahh, I put you two right here."
1,1,23,JERRY,"Oh, Okay I'm sorry, I didn't know what"
1,1,24,VANESSA,How big a tip do you think it'd take to get him to stop?
1,1,24,JERRY,I'm in for five...
1,1,24,VANESSA,I'll supply the hat.
1,1,24,JERRY,Uh-oh... What do we have here...
1,1,24,VANESSA,Why don't you relax and take your jacket off?
1,1,24,JERRY,"Oh, I can't-- I have a tendency to get chilly."
1,1,24,VANESSA,How masculine...
1,1,24,JERRY,"Plus I'm wearing short sleeves, I don't want to expose my tattoos."
1,1,25,ROGER,"Hey, this guy says he knows Bricker..."
1,1,25,VANESSA,"Oh, you know Bricker! From where?"
1,1,25,JERRY,"What's going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, she's"
1,1,27,VANESSA,How do you know Pamela?
1,1,27,JERRY,Friend of a friend. And you?
1,1,27,VANESSA,We went to law school together.
1,1,27,ELAINE,"Oh, Jerry!"
1,1,27,JERRY,"Oh no, not *now*..."
1,1,27,ELAINE,I had this dream last night and you were in it.
1,1,27,JERRY,"Oh really... Oh God, I gotta get out of this..."
1,1,27,ELAINE,"You were you, but, you weren't you..."
1,1,27,JERRY,"No kidding... Why is this happening? Please, make"
1,1,28,ELAINE,"I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were"
1,1,29,JERRY,This is *brutal*...
1,1,29,ELAINE,You turned around and you had these wooden teeth...
1,1,29,JERRY,How do you like that... Can I turn now? Is this
1,1,30,ELAINE,Jerry? Are you listening to me?
1,1,30,JERRY,"Yes, I *heard* you."
1,1,30,PAMELA,"Elaine, what's the name of that jewelry store you took me to that"
1,1,31,JERRY,"Thank *you*, Pamela!"
1,1,31,JERRY,"So, you're a lawyer..."
1,1,31,VANESSA,"Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft."
1,1,31,JERRY,"Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft."
1,1,33,VANESSA,"Oh, that was you!"
1,1,33,JERRY,"Imagine, spelling ""Mom"" with two O's..."
1,1,33,VANESSA,Very funny! What do you do?
1,1,33,JERRY,Comedian.
1,1,33,VANESSA,Really... That explains it...
1,1,33,JERRY,"Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft."
1,1,34,ROGER,Are you ready?
1,1,34,VANESSA,We gotta run. Happy birthday!
1,1,34,JERRY,I can't believe it-- I got *nothing*! I don't even
1,1,35,JERRY,"Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and"
1,1,36,JERRY,"That wasn't so bad, really..."
1,1,36,ELAINE,"Y'know, uh, you could use a little work on your manners."
1,1,36,JERRY,Why? What did I do?
1,1,36,ELAINE,"Well, I just don't appreciate these little ""courtesy responses"","
1,1,37,JERRY,I was listening!
1,1,37,ELAINE,"No! You couldn't wait to get back to your little... ""conversation""."
1,1,37,JERRY,"No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had."
1,1,37,ELAINE,Uh-huh...
1,1,37,JERRY,"Where you had, uh, wooden teeth."
1,1,37,ELAINE,No! No! *You* had wooden teeth! *You* had wooden teeth! *I*
1,1,38,JERRY,"Alright, so *I* had wooden teeth, so what?"
1,1,38,ELAINE,So nothing... Nothing...
1,1,38,JERRY,"Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic"
1,1,47,JERRY,Hey!
1,1,47,MORTY,"Ah, there he is!"
1,1,47,JERRY,"This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your"
1,1,48,HELEN,"Y'know, Jerry, we don't have to do this..."
1,1,48,JERRY,"What are you talkin' about? It's fine, I love having you here..."
1,1,48,HELEN,Tomorrow we'll go to a hotel.
1,1,48,JERRY,"Ma, will you stop?"
1,1,48,HELEN,"No, why should we take over your apartment?"
1,1,48,JERRY,I don't care-- I'm sleeping next door.
1,1,48,HELEN,Your friend Kramer doesn't mind?
1,1,48,JERRY,"No, he's making a bouillabaisse."
1,1,48,JERRY,"So Dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big"
1,1,49,MORTY,Depends on the firm.
1,1,49,JERRY,"Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they"
1,1,50,MORTY,What's the matter? You need a lawyer?
1,1,50,JERRY,"No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I"
1,1,51,MORTY,So why don't you ask someone who was at the party?
1,1,51,JERRY,"Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I can't ask her."
1,1,51,HELEN,Why not?
1,1,51,JERRY,Because it's complicated-- there's some tension there.
1,1,51,HELEN,He used to go with her...
1,1,51,HELEN,Which one is she?
1,1,51,MORTY,From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered
1,1,52,MORTY,"Oh yeah, very alert. Warm person."
1,1,52,JERRY,"Oh yeah, she's great."
1,1,52,HELEN,"So, how come nothing materialized there?"
1,1,52,JERRY,"Well, it's a tough thing to talk about... I dunno..."
1,1,52,HELEN,I know what it was...
1,1,52,JERRY,You don't know what it was...
1,1,52,HELEN,"So, what was it?"
1,1,52,JERRY,"Well, we fight a lot for some reason..."
1,1,52,H + M,"Oh, well..."
1,1,52,JERRY,And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry...
1,1,52,HELEN,"Well, I think she's a very attractive girl."
1,1,52,JERRY,"Oh, she is, she absolutely is."
1,1,52,HELEN,I can see if there was a *weight* problem...
1,1,52,JERRY,"No, it's not that. It wasn't all one-sided."
1,1,52,HELEN,"You know, you can't be so particular. Nobody's perfect."
1,1,52,JERRY,"I know, I know..."
1,1,52,MORTY,"Y'know Jerry, it's a good thing I wasn't so particular."
1,1,52,HELEN,"Idiot... So who're you looking for, Sophia Loren?"
1,1,52,JERRY,That's got *nothin'* to do with it.
1,1,52,MORTY,How about Loni Anderson?
1,1,52,HELEN,Where do you get Loni Anderson?
1,1,52,MORTY,"Why, what's wrong with Loni Anderson?"
1,1,52,HELEN,I like *Elaine* more than Loni Anderson...
1,1,52,JERRY,"What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasn't ""the one""."
1,1,52,HELEN,"And this other one's ""the one""?"
1,1,52,JERRY,"I dunno, maybe..."
1,1,52,MORTY,So ask Elaine there for the number.
1,1,52,JERRY,"I can't-- she'll get upset. I never talk about other women with her,"
1,1,53,HELEN,How could you still see her if your not interested?
1,1,53,JERRY,We're *friends*.
1,1,53,MORTY,Doesn't sound like you're friends to me. If you were friends you'd
1,1,54,JERRY,Oh yeah...
1,1,54,MORTY,"Well, go up to the office."
1,1,54,HELEN,Up to her office?
1,1,54,MORTY,"Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesn't she?"
1,1,54,JERRY,I guess...
1,1,54,MORTY,"So, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for her to"
1,1,55,JERRY,"You mean ""stakeout"" the lobby?"
1,1,55,HELEN,"Morty, that's ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!"
1,1,55,MORTY,He doesn't want to ask Elaine for the number.
1,1,55,HELEN,So you've got him standing by the elevator like a *dope*! What
1,1,56,MORTY,He pretends he *bumped* into her!
1,1,56,JERRY,Y'know what? This is *not* that *bad* an idea...
1,1,56,GEORGE,What does she look like?
1,1,56,JERRY,I dunno. Hard to say.
1,1,56,GEORGE,What actress does she remind you of?
1,1,56,JERRY,Loni Anderson.
1,1,56,GEORGE,Loni Anderson?!
1,1,56,JERRY,"What, there's something wrong with Loni Anderson?"
1,1,56,JERRY,"Hey listen, thanks again for running over here. I appreciate it."
1,1,56,GEORGE,"Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th st. Besides, you think"
1,1,57,JERRY,I'm a little nervous.
1,1,57,GEORGE,"Yeah, me too..."
1,1,57,JERRY,"If I see her, what do I say that I'm doing here in the building?"
1,1,57,GEORGE,You came to see me; I work in the building.
1,1,57,JERRY,What do you do?
1,1,57,GEORGE,I'm an *architect*.
1,1,57,JERRY,You're an *architect*?
1,1,57,GEORGE,I'm not?
1,1,57,JERRY,I don't see architecture comin from you...
1,1,57,GEORGE,I suppose *you* could be an architect...
1,1,57,JERRY,I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin' else...
1,1,57,GEORGE,"Alright, she's not even gonna ask, if we *see* her, which is remote."
1,1,57,JERRY,"Well what'dya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?!"
1,1,57,GEORGE,We're having lunch with a friend-- he works in the building.
1,1,57,JERRY,What is *his* name?
1,1,57,GEORGE,Bert... Har... bin... son. Bert Har-bin-son.
1,1,57,JERRY,Bert Harbinson? It sounds made up.
1,1,57,GEORGE,"No good? Alright, how about Art... Corr....."
1,1,57,JERRY,Art Corr...
1,1,57,GEORGE,...velay...
1,1,57,JERRY,Corvelay?
1,1,57,GEORGE,"Yeah, right."
1,1,57,JERRY,"Well, what does *he* do?"
1,1,57,GEORGE,He's an importer.
1,1,57,JERRY,"Just imports, no exports?"
1,1,57,GEORGE,"He's an importer/exporter, okay?"
1,1,57,GEORGE,"Say, did Elaine ever call you back?"
1,1,57,JERRY,"No, I guess she's still mad."
1,1,57,GEORGE,"I don't understand, you never talk to her about other women?"
1,1,57,JERRY,Never.
1,1,57,JERRY,Wait a second... That's her... on the right.
1,1,57,GEORGE,I forgot who I am! Who am I?!
1,1,57,JERRY,You're you. We're having lunch with Art Corvelay.
1,1,57,GEORGE,Vandelay!
1,1,57,JERRY,Corvelay!
1,1,57,GEORGE,"Let me be the architect, I can do it!"
1,1,57,JERRY,"Hey, hey... Pamela's birthday party, didn't I see you there..."
1,1,58,VANESSA,Sure! Hi!
1,1,58,JERRY,This is George. I'm sorry...

1,1,58,VANESSA,That's right! What're you doing here?
1,1,58,JERRY,"Oh, were meeting a friend of ours for lunch. He works here in the"
1,1,59,GEORGE,"Yeah, Art *Vandelay*."
1,1,59,VANESSA,Really? Which company?
1,1,59,JERRY,I don't know. He's an importer.
1,1,59,VANESSA,Importer?
1,1,59,GEORGE,...And exporter.
1,1,59,JERRY,He's an importer/exporter.
1,1,59,GEORGE,"I'm, uh, I'm an architect."
1,1,59,VANESSA,Really. What do you design?
1,1,59,GEORGE,"Uh, railroads, uh..."
1,1,59,VANESSA,I thought engineers do that.
1,1,59,GEORGE,They can...
1,1,59,JERRY,Y'know I'm sorry you had to leave so early the other night.
1,1,59,VANESSA,"Oh, me too. My cousin had to go back to Boston."
1,1,59,JERRY,"Oh, that guy was your *cousin*!"
1,1,59,VANESSA,"Yeah, and that woman was your--"
1,1,59,JERRY,Friend!
1,1,59,GEORGE,"I'll just, uh, get a paper..."

1,1,59,VANESSA,Almost exclusively...
1,1,59,HELEN,Bum bum bum bum... I have no letters... Bum bum bum bum...
1,1,59,JERRY,"Ma, will you go already?"
1,1,59,HELEN,Bum bum bum bum...
1,1,59,JERRY,What are you doing?!
1,1,59,HELEN,"Wait, I just want to see something..."
1,1,59,JERRY,"You can't look in there, we're playing!"
1,1,59,MORTY,"Evening, Mr. Kramer!"
1,1,59,KRAMER,Hey Morty! Salad dressing?
1,1,59,JERRY,Look.
1,1,59,HELEN,"""Quo""? Is that a word?"
1,1,59,JERRY,Maybe!
1,1,59,HELEN,Will you challenge it?
1,1,59,JERRY,"Ma, you can't look up words in the dictionary! Dad, she's cheating!"
1,1,59,KRAMER,"""Quo""? That's not a word."
1,1,59,HELEN,You're such a stickler...
1,1,59,JERRY,"Well put *something* down, you're taking twenty minutes on this."
1,1,61,HELEN,"They'll be here at two o'clock... Oh, Elaine called. She said"
1,1,61,SHE'D BE HERE AT 2,"30. Oh, and she says ``Hope your meeting went"
1,1,62,JERRY,She said *what*?
1,1,62,HELEN,"Just what I said, here."
1,1,62,JERRY,"She knows! Oh, I am *such* a *jackass*..."
1,1,62,HELEN,She knows what?
1,1,62,JERRY,She knows the whole stupid thing... Vanessa and the elevator...
1,1,62,HELEN,"No, no, no, that won't do. He may have a ""Z""..."
1,1,62,MORTY,"So, how did she find out?"
1,1,62,JERRY,"Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told"
1,1,63,MORTY,"So, what are you? Afraid of her?"
1,1,63,JERRY,Yes. *Yes* *I* *am*!
1,1,63,JERRY,What else did she say on the phone?
1,1,63,HELEN,Whatever I wrote down.
1,1,63,JERRY,"Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?"
1,1,63,HELEN,"Who am I, Rich Little?"
1,1,63,MORTY,"Well, she can't be too mad-- she's still coming to the wedding."
1,1,63,JERRY,"Yeah, but now I'm nervous."
1,1,63,HELEN,"Oh, stop it."
1,1,63,JERRY,"""Quone""?"
1,1,63,JERRY,"""Quone""? No, I'm afraid that I'm going to have to challenge that."
1,1,63,KRAMER,"No, you don't have to challenge that. That's a word. That's a"
1,1,64,JERRY,I am challenging...
1,1,64,KRAMER,Quone: to quone something.
1,1,64,JERRY,Uh-huh...
1,1,64,HELEN,I'm not playing with you anymore...
1,1,64,MORTY,Quone's not a word...
1,1,64,JERRY,No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off...
1,1,64,HELEN,Why did you make me put that down?
1,1,64,KRAMER,"Nah, we need a *medical* dictionary! If a patient gets difficult,"
1,1,65,CAROL,"You want some funny material, you oughta come down to where I work,"
1,1,66,JERRY,You must have quite a time down there.
1,1,66,CAROL,We got plenty of time...
1,1,66,JERRY,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just waiting for someone..."
1,1,66,MAC,Watch what you say to this guy-- he'll put it in his next act!
1,1,66,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah..."
1,1,66,MAC,"Jerry, did I tell you that I'm writing a book? An autobiography."
1,1,66,JERRY,"Yeah, Uncle Mac, you mentioned it..."
1,1,66,MAC,It's based on all my experiences!
1,1,66,JERRY,That's perfect. Could you excuse me one second.
1,1,67,JERRY,"How do you do, Jerry Seinfeld."
1,1,67,ELAINE,"Oh, how do you do. Elaine Benes."
1,1,67,JERRY,"Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until we get"
1,1,68,ELAINE,"Oh no, let's do it now."
1,1,68,JERRY,"Alright, the whole elevator business, let me just explain--"
1,1,68,ELAINE,Okay...
1,1,68,ARTIE,"Jerry, were you goin' with us?"
1,1,68,JERRY,"No, I'm gonna take my car."
1,1,68,ARTIE,That's why I brought the wagon. Why the Hell did I bring the wagon?
1,1,68,JERRY,"Anyway, you know why I didn't ask you, I mean I felt so"
1,1,69,ELAINE,"Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before. It was"
1,1,70,CAROL,"Jerry, we'll see you there. Bye, Elaine."
1,1,70,ELAINE,"Oh, bye. Good to see you."
1,1,70,ARTIE,"Oh, we didn't meet."
1,1,70,JERRY,"Oh, I'm sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin Artie Levine."
1,1,70,ARTIE,Le*vine*.
1,1,70,JERRY,"Yeah, ""Le*vine*"". And I'm Jerry Cougar Mellencamp... Anyway, I"
1,1,72,ELAINE,"Yeah, obviously."
1,1,72,JERRY,"I mean, if we're gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about"
1,1,73,ELAINE,Couldn't agree more.
1,1,73,JERRY,Good.
1,1,73,ELAINE,Good.
1,1,73,JERRY,Good.
1,1,73,ELAINE,Great!
1,1,73,JERRY,"Great? Where do you get ""great""?"
1,1,73,ELAINE,It's great to... talk about... other people...
1,1,73,JERRY,...Guys.
1,1,73,ELAINE,Yeah.
1,1,73,JERRY,"Uh-huh... Yeah... So, anybody specific?"
1,1,73,ELAINE,No. A general guy.
1,1,73,JERRY,Oh *really*... Elaine Marie Benes...
1,1,73,ELAINE,"What? No, it's not a big deal."
1,1,73,JERRY,"No, that's great! That's terrific!"
1,1,73,ELAINE,"No, we just met..."
1,1,73,JERRY,Doesn't matter. What's the young man's name? I would like to
1,1,74,ELAINE,I don't think so...
1,1,74,JERRY,"Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, a craftsman, a labourer"
1,1,75,ELAINE,Wall street.
1,1,75,JERRY,"Ahh, high finance: bulls... bears... people from Conneticut."
1,1,75,ELAINE,And he happens to be pretty good lookin'
1,1,75,JERRY,"Alright, sir."
1,1,75,ELAINE,And... he's *hilarious*.
