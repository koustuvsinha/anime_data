2,0,0,THE EX-GIRLFRIEND,Written by Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld
2,0,1,JERRY,"I'm always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice.. Never quite sure, ""Is this the best lane for"
2,0,7,GEORGE,She can't kill me right?!
2,0,7,JERRY,"No, of course not."
2,0,7,GEORGE,People break up all the time.
2,0,7,JERRY,Everyday.
2,0,7,GEORGE,It just didn't work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldn't.
2,0,7,JERRY,You tried.
2,0,7,GEORGE,"I kept looking at her face. I'd go: ""C'mon, love her. Love her!"""
2,0,7,JERRY,Did you tell her you loved her?
2,0,7,GEORGE,"Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! She'd tell me she loved me. Alright, at first, I just look at her. I'd go ""Oh, really?"" or ""Boy, that's, that's"
2,0,8,JERRY,You're a human being.
2,0,8,GEORGE,And I didn't even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? I can't do that to someone.
2,0,8,JERRY,You're too nice a guy.
2,0,8,GEORGE,"I am. I'm a nice guy.. And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, I'm sitting on the couch, she's on the chair - I get up to go to the"
2,0,9,JERRY,You're flesh and blood.
2,0,9,GEORGE,"I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didn't want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But"
2,0,11,JERRY,I told you when I met her..
2,0,11,GEORGE,My back is killing me.
2,0,11,JERRY,"You gotta go to my chiropractor, he's the best."
2,0,11,GEORGE,"Oh yeah, everybody's guy is the best."
2,0,11,JERRY,I'm gonna make an appointment for you. We'll go together.
2,0,11,GEORGE,"Please. They don't do anything.. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? CAn't I do it over the phone? I have no stomach for these things."
2,0,11,JERRY,You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off!
2,0,12,ELAINE,Hi.
2,0,12,JERRY,Hi.
2,0,13,ELAINE,"Hey, what are you doing?"
2,0,13,GEORGE,I'm letting you in.
2,0,13,ELAINE,Oh no. No. I don't want to sit in the back. I'll be left out of the conversation.
2,0,13,GEORGE,"No, you won't."
2,0,13,ELAINE,"Yes, I will, George. I'll have to sick my chin on top of the seat."
2,0,13,GEORGE,Okay..
2,0,14,ELAINE,Why can't you sit in the middle?
2,0,14,GEORGE,"Please, it doesn't look good. Boy, boy, girl."
2,0,14,ELAINE,"I think you're afraid to sit next to a man. You're a little homophobic, aren't you?"
2,0,14,GEORGE,Is it that obvious?
2,0,15,ELAINE,"Hello, Jerry."
2,0,15,JERRY,Hello.
2,0,15,ELAINE,Did you get a haircut?
2,0,15,JERRY,"No, shower. So, where are we eating?"
2,0,15,ELAINE,"Tell me if you think this is strange: There's this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. He's a teacher, or"
2,0,18,GEORGE,"""You know, I'd go from nods to nothing.."""
2,0,18,ELAINE,"And now, there's this intense animosity whenever we passs. I mean, it's like we really hate each other. It's based on nothing."
2,0,18,JERRY,A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened to The Blob.
2,0,18,GEORGE,I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.
2,0,18,ELAINE,Really?
2,0,18,GEORGE,Yes.
2,0,18,ELAINE,You would do that?
2,0,18,GEORGE,If I was a different person.
2,0,20,JERRY,"Hello.. hello. Is Glenn there? I'm sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?.. Yes, I know I have the wrong number. But I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if.."
2,0,22,KRAMER,Come on up.
2,0,22,JERRY,"Oh, it's you again. See? Now if you had answered me, I wouldn't have had to do this. Now that's too long distance calls I made to you why"
2,0,24,KRAMER,Taste this.
2,0,24,JERRY,"No, I just had a sandwich."
2,0,24,KRAMER,"No, taste it. Taste it."
2,0,24,JERRY,I don't want cantaloupe now.
2,0,24,KRAMER,You've never had cantaloupe like this before.
2,0,24,JERRY,I only eat cantaloupe at certain times.
2,0,24,KRAMER,Jerry. This is great cantaloupe.
2,0,24,JERRY,Alright..
2,0,24,KRAMER,"Ah, huh. It's good?"
2,0,24,JERRY,It's very good.
2,0,24,KRAMER,"Good, huh?"
2,0,24,JERRY,Good.
2,0,24,KRAMER,I got it at Joe's.
2,0,24,JERRY,Uh-Huh.
2,0,24,KRAMER,Forty-nine cents a pound. That's practically half than what you're paying at the supermarket. I don't know why you don't go to Joe's.
2,0,24,JERRY,It's too far.
2,0,24,KRAMER,It's three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..
2,0,24,JERRY,I'm not pulling a shopping cart. What am I suppose to wear? A kerchief? Put stockings on and roll 'em down below my knee?
2,0,24,KRAMER,"See, the other thing is, if you don't like anything, he takes it right back."
2,0,24,JERRY,I don't return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.
2,0,25,GEORGE,I'm outta there. I did it! It's over.
2,0,25,JERRY,You did it? What happened?
2,0,25,GEORGE,"I told her. In the kitchen - which was risky 'cause it's near all the knives. I started with the word ""Listen."""
2,0,25,JERRY,Ah ha.
2,0,25,GEORGE,"I said, ""Listen Marlene,"" and then the next thing I know, I'm in the middle of it. And there's this voice inside of me going: ""You're doing it! You're doing"
2,0,28,JERRY,"See, it's never as bad as you imagine."
2,0,28,KRAMER,I liked Marlene. What's her number?
2,0,28,GEORGE,"No, I, I don't think so."
2,0,29,JERRY,Could you stop that smacking?
2,0,29,KRAMER,"George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe."
2,0,29,GEORGE,"Oh no, thank you."
2,0,29,KRAMER,It's the best cantaloupe I ever had.
2,0,29,GEORGE,"No, really. No, no, thanks."
2,0,29,KRAMER,"Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is."
2,0,29,JERRY,It's very good cantaloupe. So that's it? You're out?
2,0,29,GEORGE,Except for one small problem. I left some books in her apartment.
2,0,29,JERRY,"So, go get them."
2,0,29,GEORGE,"Oh, no. No, I can't go back there. Jerry, it's so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous - sexually. Something could happen, I'd be right back"
2,0,30,JERRY,So forget about the books. Did you read them?
2,0,30,GEORGE,"Well, yeah."
2,0,30,JERRY,What do you need them for?
2,0,30,GEORGE,I don't know. They're books.
2,0,30,JERRY,What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses - like they're trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?
2,0,30,GEORGE,They're MY books.
2,0,30,JERRY,So you want me to get those books? Is that it?
2,0,33,MARLENE,"..So, it must've been ninety-five degrees that night, and everyone's just standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands. I was wearing my old"
2,0,35,JERRY,So what'd you do?
2,0,35,MARLENE,"Well, nothing. It's not skin off my hide if people like to look. I just didn't see what the big attraction was."
2,0,35,JERRY,"Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess."
2,0,35,MARLENE,"Hey, you know, Jerry, just because George and I don't see each other anymore, it doesn't mean we shouldn't stay friends."
2,0,35,JERRY,No.
2,0,35,MARLENE,Good enough. I'm really glad we got that settled.
2,0,37,JERRY,I don't know how this happened.
2,0,37,GEORGE,"Jerry, it's not my fault."
2,0,37,JERRY,"No, no. It's not your fault. Books, books, I need my books. Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read"
2,0,40,GEORGE,That's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?
2,0,40,JERRY,"Ohh.. you know, and sometimes she'll go, ""Hello, Jerry?"" and I'll go ""Oh, hi Marlene."" And then it's ""Jerry.."""
2,0,40,GEORGE,What about getting off the phone?
2,0,40,JERRY,"Ohhhh.. you can't. It's impossible. There's no break in the conversation where you can go, ""Alright, then.. "" You know, it just goes on and on and on with"
2,0,41,GEORGE,"Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion, right off! She is sexy though. Don't you think?"
2,0,41,JERRY,"Yeah. Yes, she is."
2,0,42,RECEPTIONIST,Mr. Costanza?
2,0,42,GEORGE,Yeah.
2,0,42,RECEPTIONIST,The doctor'll see you now.
2,0,42,GEORGE,"Yeah, doctor. I'm going to have to wait in that little room by myself, aren't I? I better take this."
2,0,45,JERRY,"Waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. 'Cause it says ""Waiting room."" There's no chance of not waiting, 'cause they call it the waiting"
2,0,56,JERRY,"So, how was it?"
2,0,56,GEORGE,"I was in there for two minutes. He didn't do anything. Touch this, feel that. Seventy-five bucks."
2,0,56,JERRY,"Well, it's a first visit."
2,0,56,GEORGE,"What's seventy-five bucks? What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Amd I being entertained? I don't understand this. I'm only paying half."
2,0,56,JERRY,You can't do that.
2,0,56,GEORGE,Why not?
2,0,56,JERRY,He's a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.
2,0,56,GEORGE,"Oh, no, no, no. I pay what I say."
2,0,58,MARLENE,Are you feeling weird?
2,0,58,JERRY,"No, I'm fine."
2,0,58,MARLENE,Nothing really happened.
2,0,58,JERRY,"Yeah, I know."
2,0,58,MARLENE,We just kissed a little. People kiss.
2,0,58,JERRY,Yeah.
2,0,58,MARLENE,Well.. night.
2,0,59,JERRY,Good night.
2,0,62,KRAMER,Hey.
2,0,62,JERRY,Hey.
2,0,62,KRAMER,"I got it! This time, I got it!"
2,0,62,JERRY,Alright.
2,0,62,KRAMER,"Hips! See, it's all hips."
2,0,62,JERRY,Uh-huh.
2,0,62,KRAMER,You gotta come through with the hips first.
2,0,62,JERRY,That is out there.
2,0,63,KRAMER,Joe's?
2,0,63,JERRY,"No, supermarket."
2,0,63,KRAMER,"Well, is it good?"
2,0,63,JERRY,It's okay.
2,0,63,KRAMER,"Let me taste it. See, that stinks. You can't eat that. You should take it back."
2,0,63,JERRY,I'm not taking it back.
2,0,63,KRAMER,"Alright, I'll take it back. I'm going by there."
2,0,63,JERRY,I don't care about it.
2,0,63,KRAMER,"Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation."
2,0,63,JERRY,Alright. Take it back.
2,0,64,JERRY,"Leave a message, I'll call you back."
2,0,64,MARLENE,"Jerry, have you ever taken a bath in the dark? If I'm not talking into the soap right now, call me back."
2,0,64,KRAMER,Well?
2,0,64,JERRY,Marlene
2,0,64,KRAMER,"Oh. Oh, Marlene."
2,0,64,JERRY,"Yeah, I took her home one night - we kinda started up a little bit in the car."
2,0,64,KRAMER,I thought you were trying to get rid of her?
2,0,64,JERRY,"I was. She's got me, like, hypnotized."
2,0,64,KRAMER,Does George know?
2,0,64,JERRY,"No, he'd go nuts."
2,0,64,KRAMER,"Yeah, no kidding."
2,0,64,JERRY,"I feel terrible. I mean, I've seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I can't go any further, but.. I've just got this like,"
2,0,65,KRAMER,"Woah, psycho-sexual."
2,0,65,JERRY,I don't know how I'm going to tell him.
2,0,65,KRAMER,"Man, I don't understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?"
2,0,65,JERRY,"It's partially you, yeah."
2,0,65,KRAMER,You're his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else. Some jerk that he doesn't even know.
2,0,65,JERRY,"Well, he can't kill me, right?"
2,0,65,KRAMER,You're a human being.
2,0,65,JERRY,"I mean, she called me. I haven't called her. She started it."
2,0,65,KRAMER,You're flesh and blood.
2,0,65,JERRY,I'm a nice guy.
2,0,66,ELAINE,Hi.
2,0,66,JERRY,"Oh, my little airplane lamp."
2,0,66,ELAINE,"You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones."
2,0,66,JERRY,"Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time."
2,0,66,ELAINE,Unless you're married to a dictator..
2,0,66,JERRY,Yeah.. because they would be very demanding people.
2,0,66,ELAINE,"Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point, somebody's going to offer me some cantaloupe."
2,0,66,KRAMER,Nope. No good.
2,0,66,JERRY,"Well, you know what they say: Luck in love, Unlucky with fruit."
2,0,66,KRAMER,"Well, I'm taking this back."
2,0,66,ELAINE,"So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning."
2,0,66,JERRY,Really? That guy who stopped saying hello?
2,0,66,ELAINE,Yep.
2,0,66,JERRY,You talked to him?
2,0,66,ELAINE,"Yep. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought ""no, no, no, no. Do not be afraid of this man."""
2,0,66,JERRY,Right.
2,0,66,ELAINE,"So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, ""Hi, remember me?"" And he furrows his brow as if he's really trying to figure it"
2,0,67,JERRY,"""You little phony""?"
2,0,67,ELAINE,"I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, ""Oh, yeah. You're Jeanette's friend. We did meet once."" And I said, ""Well, how do you go from that to"
2,0,68,JERRY,Amazing.
2,0,68,ELAINE,"And he says, he says, ""Look, I just didn't want to say hello anymore, alright?"" And I said, ""Fine. Fine I didn't want to say hello anymore either, but I"
2,0,70,JERRY,"You are the Queen of Confrontation. You're my new hero. In fact, you've inspired me. I'm gonna call George about something right now."
2,0,70,ELAINE,This cantaloupe stinks.
2,0,72,GEORGE,I don't care.
2,0,72,JERRY,You're kidding.
2,0,72,GEORGE,"No, I don't care."
2,0,72,JERRY,You mean that?
2,0,72,GEORGE,Absolutely.
2,0,72,JERRY,You don't care?
2,0,72,GEORGE,No.
2,0,72,JERRY,How could you not care?
2,0,72,GEORGE,I don't know. But I don't. I'm actually almost happy to hear it.
2,0,72,JERRY,I thought you'd be upset.
2,0,72,GEORGE,I guess I should be but I'm not.
2,0,72,JERRY,Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?
2,0,72,GEORGE,"No, you're a fine person. You're a humanitarian. She's very sexy."
2,0,72,JERRY,That voice. That voice. She's driving me crazy.
2,0,72,GEORGE,"I know, I know."
2,0,72,JERRY,"So I can see her tonight, and you don't care?"
2,0,72,GEORGE,See her tonight. See her tomarrow. Go. Knock yourself out. She's too crazy for me.
2,0,72,JERRY,Alright. As long as you're okay. Because I can't stop thinking about her.
2,0,72,GEORGE,I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.
2,0,72,JERRY,Good. And I'll tell you what.. You don't have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.
2,0,72,GEORGE,You paid that crook?!
2,0,72,JERRY,I had to.
2,0,72,GEORGE,"He didn't do anything, Jerry. It's a scam! Who told you to do that?"
2,0,72,JERRY,It was embarrassing to me.
2,0,72,GEORGE,I was trying to make a point.
2,0,72,JERRY,Why don't you make a point with your own doctor? What's wrong?
2,0,72,GEORGE,I think I swallowed a fly! ..I swallowed a fly! What do I do? What can happen?
2,0,74,JERRY,"..So, you want to come up for a few minutes?"
2,0,74,MARLENE,"..I'm sorry, Jerry. I just don't think this is going to work."
2,0,74,JERRY,Really? I thought..
2,0,74,MARLENE,"I know, I'm sorry."
2,0,74,JERRY,I guess I just didn't expect it from the way you've been acting.
2,0,74,MARLENE,You sure you want to talk about this? 'Cause I sure don't.
2,0,74,JERRY,Of course I want to talk about it.
2,0,74,MARLENE,"Well, okay. I guess things changed for me on Tuesday night."
2,0,74,JERRY,Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night?
2,0,74,MARLENE,
2,0,74,JERRY,My act? What does that have to do with anything?
2,0,74,MARLENE,"Well, to be honest, it just didn't make it for me. It's just so much fluff."
2,0,74,JERRY,"I can't believe this. So what are you saying? You didn't like my act, so that's it?"
2,0,74,MARLENE,I can't be with someone if I don't respect what they do.
2,0,74,JERRY,You're a cashier!
2,0,74,MARLENE,"Look, Jerry, it's just not my kind of humor."
2,0,74,JERRY,You can't go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.
2,0,74,MARLENE,I heard the material.
2,0,74,JERRY,I have other stuff. You should come see me on the weekend.
2,0,76,JERRY,"Women need to like the job of the guy they're with. If they don't like the job, they don't like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony bogus names for the jobs that we have. ""Well, right now, I'm the regional management supervisor."" ""I'm in development, research, consulting."" Men on the other hand, if they are physically attracted to a woman are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men don't really care. Men'll just go, ""Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that where you work? That sounds interesting. So whatdya got a big cleaver there? You're just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen, why don't you shower up, and we'll get some burgers and catch a movie."""
2,0,76,THE END,
