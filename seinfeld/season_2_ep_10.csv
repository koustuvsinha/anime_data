2,10,19,ELAINE,You mean lying to your uncle?
2,10,19,JERRY,"I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', one night"
2,10,20,GEORGE,"You know it's a public phone, you're not supposed to just"
2,10,21,ELAINE,"Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away."
2,10,21,JERRY,"Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table."
2,10,21,GEORGE,He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He just doesn't wanna look.
2,10,21,ELAINE,"Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it?"
2,10,21,JERRY,"Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house."
2,10,21,ELAINE,Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose things.
2,10,21,GEORGE,I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it with humanity?
2,10,23,ELAINE,What?
2,10,23,JERRY,"There's a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark hair,"
2,10,24,ELAINE,I've never seen her before.
2,10,24,JERRY,I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy.
2,10,25,MAN,"Oh, Excuse me."
2,10,25,ELAINE,I'm sorry.
2,10,26,ELAINE,"Didja see that? Those people, look, they're getting a table."
2,10,26,JERRY,Well maybe they were here from before.
2,10,26,ELAINE,"No no no, they weren't here before."
2,10,26,GEORGE,"Excuse me, are you going to be much longer? I have to make a"

2,10,30,BRUCE,"No, no, they were here before. Keckitch,"
2,10,30,ELAINE,Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table?
2,10,32,JERRY,"Boy, you are really hungry."
2,10,32,GEORGE,Hey!
2,10,33,GEORGE,"If anything happens here, can I count on you?"
2,10,33,JERRY,What?
2,10,33,GEORGE,If we decide to go at it.
2,10,33,JERRY,"Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble..."
2,10,33,GEORGE,I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little outfit.
2,10,35,ELAINE,I'm gonna faint...
2,10,35,JERRY,"George, who is that woman in the stripes?"
2,10,35,GEORGE,I don't know her.
2,10,35,JERRY,She looks so familiar.
2,10,35,ELAINE,"Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First Served, It"
2,10,37,JERRY,"I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it."
2,10,37,ELAINE,What do you mean?
2,10,37,JERRY,"You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't say"
2,10,39,GEORGE,What are they gonna do?
2,10,39,JERRY,"They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell"
2,10,40,ELAINE,"50 bucks, you'll give me 50 bucks?"
2,10,40,JERRY,"50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples."
2,10,40,ELAINE,
2,10,42,JERRY,"No, no tricks."
2,10,42,ELAINE,"Should I do it, George?"
2,10,42,GEORGE,For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow.
2,10,42,ELAINE,"Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it."
2,10,43,ELAINE,"I know this sounds crazy, but the two men who are"
2,10,46,ELAINE,I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.
2,10,46,PEOPLE AT TABLE,What? What is she talking about? What did she say?
2,10,47,JERRY,What happened?
2,10,47,ELAINE,Did you see that?
2,10,47,GEORGE,What were you doing?
2,10,47,ELAINE,"I offered them 25, they had no idea..."
2,10,47,JERRY,"George, the phone's free."
2,10,47,GEORGE,Alleluia.
2,10,48,GEORGE,"Excuse me, I was waiting here."
2,10,48,WOMAN AT PHONE,Where? I didn't see you.
2,10,48,GEORGE,I've been standing here for the last ten minutes!
2,10,48,WOMAN,Well I won't be long.
2,10,48,GEORGE,That's not the point. The point is I was here first.
2,10,48,WOMAN,"Well if you were here first, you'd be holding the phone."
2,10,48,GEORGE,"You know, we're living in a society! We're supposed"
2,10,50,GEORGE,Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity
2,10,52,GUY,"Hey, sorry I took so long."
2,10,52,GEORGE,"Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it."
2,10,52,ELAINE,"How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna walk around,"
2,10,53,JERRY,I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that?
2,10,53,GEORGE,"Yeah, well, he probably bought it."
2,10,53,JERRY,So what happened with Tatiana?
2,10,53,GEORGE,I shouldn't even tell you this.
2,10,53,JERRY,Come on...
2,10,53,GEORGE,"Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment."
2,10,53,JERRY,I'm with you.
2,10,53,GEORGE,"Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like"
2,10,62,JERRY,This could only happen to you.
2,10,62,GEORGE,"So I finally stop and say, ""Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the"
2,10,63,JERRY,You said this to her after.
2,10,63,GEORGE,No. During.
2,10,63,JERRY,"Oh, boy."
2,10,63,GEORGE,Yeah.
2,10,63,JERRY,Wow! So...?
2,10,63,GEORGE,"So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this"
2,10,70,ELAINE,"I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back"
2,10,71,JERRY,Who is that woman?!
2,10,71,ELAINE,"Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember,"
2,10,75,GEORGE,She's off.
2,10,75,ELAINE,"Jerry, talk to that guy again."
2,10,75,JERRY,What am I gonna say?
2,10,75,ELAINE,Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late.
2,10,76,MR. COHEN,"Hey, what stinks in here?"
2,10,76,BRUCE,Mr. Cohen! Haven't seen you for a couple of weeks.
2,10,76,MR. COHEN,"Well, I've been looking for a better place."
2,10,77,BRUCE,Better place... Want a table?
2,10,77,MR. COHEN,"No, just bring me a plate and I'll eat here."
2,10,77,BRUCE,"Give him a plate and you eat here... Come on, I give you a"
2,10,78,JERRY,"Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were ahead of that"
2,10,79,BRUCE,"Oh no, Mr. Cohen always here."
2,10,79,ELAINE,He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?
2,10,79,BRUCE,"Oh, Mr. Cohen, very nice man. He live on Park Avenue."
2,10,79,ELAINE,Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?!
2,10,79,GEORGE,She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left because those
2,10,80,JERRY,Didja leave a message?
2,10,80,GEORGE,"Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the"
2,10,82,ELAINE,"Oh, Jerry, here comes that woman..."

2,10,83,LORRAINE,"Hello, Jerry!"
2,10,83,JERRY,Heeeeyyyy... How you doin'?
2,10,83,LORRAINE,How is everything?
2,10,83,JERRY,"Good, good, good... What's goin' on?"
2,10,83,LORRAINE,"Oh, working hard. And you?"
2,10,83,JERRY,"Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever."
2,10,83,LORRAINE,You haven't been around in a while.
2,10,83,JERRY,"I know, I know... Well, you know."
2,10,83,LORRAINE,You should come by.
2,10,83,JERRY,"Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that."
2,10,83,ELAINE,"Hi, I'm Elaine."
2,10,83,LORRAINE,Lorraine. Catalano.
2,10,83,JERRY,"I'm sorry, Lorraine, this is Elaine..."
2,10,84,LORRAINE,"Well it was nice seeing you, Jerry. And nice meeting you. (she"
2,10,85,ELAINE,"Oh, nice to meet you too, Lorraine!"

2,10,86,ELAINE,The one you broke the plans with tonight?
2,10,86,JERRY,"Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and"
2,10,91,JERRY,"...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me."
2,10,91,ELAINE,You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in
2,10,92,JERRY,Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8
2,10,95,JERRY,"Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we gotta get a"
2,10,96,ELAINE,"Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some"
2,10,97,JERRY,In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?
2,10,97,ELAINE,Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy
2,10,98,GEORGE,20 bucks? Isn't that excessive?
2,10,98,ELAINE,"Well what do you want to give him, change?"
2,10,98,GEORGE,It's more than the meal!
2,10,98,JERRY,"Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways."
2,10,98,GEORGE,"Alright. 7,7, 6. I'm not gonna eat that much!"
2,10,98,JERRY,"I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?"
2,10,98,GEORGE,"Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I get flustered."
2,10,99,ELAINE,"I guess it's you, Jer."
2,10,99,JERRY,Me? What about you?
2,10,99,ELAINE,"Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing."
2,10,99,JERRY,The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world
2,10,100,ELAINE,Give me the money.
2,10,101,ELAINE,How's it going'?
2,10,101,BRUCE,Very busy.
2,10,102,ELAINE,"Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down."
2,10,102,BRUCE,Very good specials tonight.
2,10,103,ELAINE,If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate
2,10,104,BRUCE,What is your name?
2,10,104,ELAINE,"No no, I want to eat now!"
2,10,104,BRUCE,"Yes, we have sea-bass dinner tonight, very fresh."
2,10,104,ELAINE,"Here, take this. I'm starving. Take it! Take"
2,10,106,BRUCE,"Dennison, 4! Your table is ready."
2,10,106,ELAINE,"No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come on, did you"
2,10,107,JERRY,You lost the 20.
2,10,107,ELAINE,"Well, how could he do that?"
2,10,107,GEORGE,You didn't make it clear.
2,10,107,ELAINE,Make it clear?
2,10,107,JERRY,"What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the money back."
2,10,109,BRUCE,Your name?
2,10,109,JERRY,Seinfeld.
2,10,109,BRUCE,"Yeah, Seinfeld 4!"
2,10,109,JERRY,"No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?"
2,10,110,BRUCE,"Oh yes, yes. Very beautiful girl, very beautiful. Is your girlfriend?"
2,10,110,JERRY,"Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really not relevant"
2,10,111,BRUCE,Relationships are difficult. It's very hard to stay together-
2,10,111,JERRY,"Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?"
2,10,111,BRUCE,"Oh. In about five, ten minutes."
2,10,112,GEORGE,So?
2,10,112,JERRY,There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.
2,10,112,ELAINE,So when are we gonna eat?
2,10,112,JERRY,"Five, ten minutes."
2,10,112,GEORGE,We should have left earlier. I told you.
2,10,112,JERRY,I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.
2,10,112,ELAINE,"Oh, well I have to eat."
2,10,112,JERRY,"Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab."
2,10,112,ELAINE,Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab?
2,10,112,JERRY,We'll eat it in the movie.
2,10,112,ELAINE,"Oh, who do you think you're going? Do you think that they have big"
2,10,113,JERRY,Well what do you suggest?
2,10,113,ELAINE,"I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down."
2,10,113,JERRY,"I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite direction,"
2,10,114,BRUCE,Cartwright?
2,10,114,ELAINE,I can't have popcorn for dinner!
2,10,114,BRUCE,Cartwright?
2,10,114,ELAINE,I have to eat!
2,10,114,JERRY,So they have hotdogs there.
2,10,114,ELAINE,"Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor."
2,10,114,GEORGE,"I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's call. Let me"
2,10,116,GEORGE,"Excuse me, I'm expecting a call. Costanza?"
2,10,116,BRUCE,"Yeah, I just got a call. I yell 'Cartwright! Cartwright!', just like"
2,10,117,GEORGE,"Well, was it for Costanza or..."
2,10,117,BRUCE,"Yes, yes, that's it. Nobody answered."
2,10,117,GEORGE,Well was it a woman?
2,10,117,BRUCE,"Yeah, yeah. I tell her you not here, she said curse word, I hang up."
2,10,118,GEORGE,She called. He yelled Cartwright. I missed her.
2,10,118,JERRY,Who's Cartwright?
2,10,118,GEORGE,I'm Cartwright!
2,10,118,JERRY,You're not Cartwri-
2,10,118,GEORGE,"Of course I'm not Cartwright! Look, why don't you two just go to the"
2,10,119,ELAINE,"Well me neither, I'm goin' to 'Skyburger'."
2,10,119,JERRY,So You're not going?
2,10,119,ELAINE,You don't need us.
2,10,119,JERRY,Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic
2,10,120,GEORGE,Should we tell him we're leaving?
2,10,120,ELAINE,What for? Let's just get out of here.
2,10,121,BRUCE,"Seinfeld, 4?"
2,10,122,JERRY,"Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating and, you know, ""This is good, who is this? I like this person"". You know, I mean, I would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like, ""Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody there? What do you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry? Get out of here!"""
2,10,122,THE END,
