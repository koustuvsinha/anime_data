2,11,1,JERRY,"I'm not a foodie. I don't, ""Oh, this is too rare. Oh, it's too salty."" Just eat it and shut up. I'll eat anywhere, whatever they're having. I have eaten rotten rolls"
2,11,7,ELAINE,Do you want some of mine?
2,11,7,JERRY,Take some of mine.
2,11,7,GEORGE,"Why do I get pesto? Why do I think I'll like it? I keep trying to like it, like I have to like it."
2,11,7,JERRY,Who said you have to like it?
2,11,7,GEORGE,"Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto."
2,11,7,JERRY,I don't like pesto.
2,11,7,GEORGE,Where was pesto 10 years ago?
2,11,7,JERRY,Look at that guy. I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants. Any time you see a guy that age
2,11,8,ELAINE,The thing about that painting.. is with the colors and um.. (Turns
2,11,10,JERRY,"Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm up for a minute."
2,11,10,GEORGE,That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work.
2,11,10,JERRY,I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.
2,11,10,GEORGE,Who?
2,11,10,JERRY,"Elaine is having a ""houseguest."" She's picking him up at the airport tonight."
2,11,10,GEORGE,A guy?
2,11,10,ELAINE,"Yes, a guy."
2,11,10,JERRY,"He's from a.. Yakima, right?"
2,11,10,ELAINE,Seattle.
2,11,10,JERRY,Everybody's moving to Seattle.
2,11,10,GEORGE,It's the pesto of cities. So..?
2,11,10,ELAINE,You tell him.
2,11,10,JERRY,"Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman."
2,11,10,ELAINE,Ed.
2,11,10,JERRY,"Who was in town on a business venture, and um.."
2,11,10,ELAINE,..We shared an interpersonal experience. Go on.
2,11,10,JERRY,"So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily."
2,11,10,ELAINE,On some people.
2,11,10,GEORGE,Oooh.
2,11,10,JERRY,"So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week."
2,11,10,ELAINE,"It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became a week."
2,11,12,MANAGER,What happened?
2,11,12,GEORGE,"Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle."
2,11,12,MANAGER,Sorry to the disturbance.
2,11,12,ELAINE,I'm never eating here again.
2,11,13,JERRY,"Nice going. Thank you, that ought to get us a free dessert.. (They can see the manager chewing the busboy out from the dining"
2,11,14,GEORGE,Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just told him what happened.. he didn't do it on purpose.. (Mangager and busboy are arguing. The
2,11,15,ELAINE,"I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding."
2,11,15,JERRY,I didn't say anything.
2,11,16,GEORGE,I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!
2,11,16,ELAINE,"Oh, I said it in a kidding way."
2,11,16,GEORGE,I didn't know he'd get fired.
2,11,16,JERRY,He'll probably kill his family over this.
2,11,16,GEORGE,What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! Did you see him point?!
2,11,16,JERRY,A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem to gravitate twards 'em.
2,11,16,GEORGE,Was it my fault?
2,11,16,ELAINE,Was it my fault?
2,11,16,JERRY,..Maybe I'll try that pesto.
2,11,17,JERRY,"Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of"
2,11,18,GEORGE,"Oh, like you really know busboys."
2,11,18,JERRY,"Oh, like you do."
2,11,18,GEORGE,"Hey, at least I was a camp waiter."
2,11,18,JERRY,Camp.
2,11,18,GEORGE,It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.
2,11,19,JERRY,Elaine?
2,11,19,ELAINE,Yeah.
2,11,20,JERRY,Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs.
2,11,20,GEORGE,Then why don't you try and get him another job?
2,11,20,JERRY,"I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins."
2,11,21,ELAINE,"I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee."
2,11,21,GEORGE,What? Did you get the busboy's number?
2,11,21,ELAINE,"His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D. Now, I did my"
2,11,23,GEORGE,How did you get all this?
2,11,23,ELAINE,"Does the word ""charm"" mean anything to you?"
2,11,23,JERRY,No. So now you're going to his apartment? I really think this is nuts.
2,11,23,GEORGE,I'd like to apologize. I want to tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble.
2,11,23,JERRY,"You, you're going now?"
2,11,23,GEORGE,"Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something."
2,11,23,JERRY,Maybe the fat camp. You're not going?
2,11,23,ELAINE,"I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport."
2,11,23,JERRY,I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till after my set?
2,11,23,GEORGE,It'll take to long.
2,11,24,JERRY,Take the K-man. A little support..
2,11,24,GEORGE,I don't a..
2,11,24,KRAMER,Take me where? Where?
2,11,26,GEORGE,"Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't mind - try not to say too much."
2,11,26,KRAMER,What am I gonna say?
2,11,26,GEORGE,I don't know.
2,11,26,KRAMER,"Well, I'm not an idiot."
2,11,26,GEORGE,Certainly not.
2,11,26,KRAMER,Then we're cool.
2,11,26,GEORGE,"Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool. Uh, I'm sorry to bother"
2,11,29,KRAMER,He's a hell of a guy.
2,11,29,GEORGE,This is a guy I know.. Kramer.
2,11,30,KRAMER,¿Habla espanol?
2,11,30,GEORGE,Oh my God.
2,11,30,ANTONIO,Si.
2,11,30,KRAMER,¿Como se dice.. waterbed?
2,11,30,GEORGE,"Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll certainly be glad to do that."
2,11,31,KRAMER,You got anything to drink? ¿Agua?
2,11,31,GEORGE,Oy uy uy.. We really should get going.
2,11,31,KRAMER,Let me get a glass of water.
2,11,31,GEORGE,Hurry up.
2,11,31,ANTONIO,Pequita? Pequita?
2,11,31,KRAMER,His cat's gone.
2,11,31,ANTONIO,La puerta esta abierta. La puerta esta abierta! Who left the door
2,11,34,KRAMER,"..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never know. They got things in"
2,11,35,GEORGE,"Once again, Antonio, I can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. The job, the cat.. (A"
2,11,36,KRAMER,The wire was sticking out.. Yeah.
2,11,36,GEORGE,"Here's my card. I'm in real estate, so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer.. (Antonio is staring at him,"
2,11,37,KRAMER,You oughta get that wire fixed. I got the door.
2,11,38,JERRY,"George, stop worrying about this guy. It wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you."
2,11,39,KRAMER,Hey.
2,11,39,JERRY,Hey. He doesn't even know where you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?.. That's Elaine.
2,11,40,KRAMER,It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.
2,11,40,JERRY,Kramer says it's up to the cat now. It'll be on your conscience.
2,11,40,KRAMER,Oh? How do you figure?
2,11,40,JERRY,How do you figure? 'Cause you're the one who left the door open.
2,11,40,KRAMER,Why was I in charge of closing the door?
2,11,40,JERRY,Why was he in charge of closing the door? 'Cause you came in after him!
2,11,40,KRAMER,So!
2,11,40,JERRY,"So! So, the last person in should close the door!"
2,11,40,KRAMER,Let me talk to him.
2,11,40,JERRY,Talk - call him from your house. He's calling you now.. okay.
2,11,40,ELAINE,Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys?
2,11,41,JERRY,No hello?
2,11,41,ELAINE,"Got any asprin? Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?"
2,11,41,JERRY,"Guarantee? ..Hey, it's a car."
2,11,41,ELAINE,"Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my"
2,11,42,JERRY,"So, did you have a nice week together?"
2,11,42,ELAINE,I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping?
2,11,42,JERRY,There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?
2,11,42,ELAINE,"Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his guts!"
2,11,42,JERRY,"So, you two been, uh.."
2,11,42,ELAIEN,"No! I told him I've been having my period for the last five days! I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But, I've only got fourteen hours to"
2,11,43,JERRY,What's your airport route?
2,11,43,ELAINE,I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.
2,11,43,JERRY,..What about the Van Wyck?
2,11,43,ELAINE,"I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut."
2,11,43,JERRY,Oooh.
2,11,43,ELAINE,"Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 10:15. We're getting up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right?"
2,11,43,JERRY,You still using that old alarm clock?
2,11,43,ELAIEN,"Oh, no, no. I bought a new one today. It's got everything - it's got everything... If you oversleep more than ten minutes, a hand comes out and slaps you in"
2,11,45,JERRY,"Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss"
2,11,52,ELAINE,Get up! The alarm clock didn't go off! It's 9:15! You're gonna miss the plane! It's
2,11,52,ELAINE,Yes! 9:15!
2,11,52,ED,We'll never make it. I'll leave tomarrow.
2,11,52,ELAINE,"Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go! You get"
2,11,53,ED,Can I shower?
2,11,53,ELAINE,Shower?! ARe you out of your mind?!
2,11,53,ED,I gotta shower. I'll feel dirty all day.
2,11,53,ELAINE,"Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on! (Pulls out drawers of clothes, turning them over in the suitcase."
2,11,54,ED,The kitchen.
2,11,54,ELAINE,The kitchen?!
2,11,54,ED,I've got a bag of cashews in there.
2,11,54,ELAINE,They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!
2,11,54,ED,What's the big deal if we don't make it? I'll just go tomarrow or the next day.
2,11,54,ELAINE,No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!
2,11,54,ED,I'll never make it.
2,11,54,ELAINE,Don't say that!
2,11,54,ED,But it takes forty-five minutes to get there. That'll only leave me five minutes to get to the plane.
2,11,54,ELAINE,Shut up and pack!
2,11,54,ED,And what if I don't make the plane? You'll have already left. Then what will I do?
2,11,54,ELAINE,You're talking too much!
2,11,54,ED,Where's my sweater?
2,11,54,ELAINE,What?!
2,11,54,ED,My brown sweater.
2,11,54,ELAINE,What? What sweater?
2,11,54,ED,My brown sweater.
2,11,54,ELAINE,You didn't bring a brown sweater.
2,11,54,ED,I brought a brown sweater.
2,11,54,ELAINE,Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?! You got a brown sweater!
2,11,54,ED,That's not mine. I can't take your sweater.
2,11,54,ELAINE,It's brown!
2,11,54,ED,What are you doing?!
2,11,54,ELAINE,
2,11,54,ED,My shoes. You packed my shoes.
2,11,54,ELAINE,Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without them! (Puts her coat on over
2,11,56,JERRY,Anywhere in the city?
2,11,56,GEORGE,Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet.
2,11,56,JERRY,Okay.. Fifty-fourth and Sixth?
2,11,56,GEORGE,"Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention my name - she'll give you the key."
2,11,56,JERRY,Alright.. Sixty-fifth and Tenth.
2,11,56,GEORGE,"ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities."
2,11,57,ELAINE,"I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in"
2,11,62,KRAMER,..The busboy's coming! The busboy's coming!
2,11,62,GEORGE,The busboy's coming?
2,11,62,JERRY,You don't mean here?
2,11,62,KRAMER,Yeah. I just buzzed him in. He's on his way up..
2,11,62,GEORGE,He's coming up?! I'll check you out later.
2,11,62,JERRY,Where are you going?
2,11,62,GEORGE,I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score.
2,11,62,JERRY,No. You three all know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game.
2,11,62,KRAMER,"No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it."
2,11,62,GEORGE,"Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me."
2,11,63,KRAMER,Antonio. In here!
2,11,64,GEORGE,"Hey, Antonio. How's it going?"
2,11,65,ANTONIO,"Three nights ago, a gas main beneath the restaurant exploded, killing five people in my section, including the busboy who replaced me. If I am not fired"
2,11,66,GEORGE,"Ah, come on.."
2,11,67,ELAINE,Yeah?
2,11,67,ED,It's Eddie.
2,11,67,ELAINE,He's coming up. He's coming up..
2,11,67,ANTONIO,"And that very same night of the accident, while looking for Pequita, I found a job in a restaurant where they pay me almost twice what I was making"
2,11,70,ED,"Hey, watch were you're going. You almost knocked my head off!"
2,11,70,ANTONIO,"Hey, why don't you watch where you're going, okay? 'Cause you bumped into me!"
2,11,70,ED,"Who do you think you're talking to, pal?"
2,11,70,ANTONIO,"Hey, get your hands off me!"
2,11,70,ED,Go to hell!
2,11,72,JERRY,He'll get another job. He's a busboy!
2,11,72,GEORGE,It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off.
2,11,72,JERRY,It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.
2,11,72,GEORGE,That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee.
2,11,72,ELAINE,"Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio. ..Thanks."
2,11,72,GEORGE,"So, much longer?"
2,11,72,ELAINE,"Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himself?"
2,11,72,GEORGE,I guess it's not important.
2,11,72,ELAINE,Take care of yourselves.
2,11,72,GEORGE,"I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy."
2,11,72,JERRY,Yeah.. How ya doing?
2,11,73,JERRY,"First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we have boxing either. It's really kind of an"
2,11,75,THE END,
