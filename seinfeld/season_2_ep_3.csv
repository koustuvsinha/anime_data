2,3,129,GEORGE,You do it for me.
2,3,129,JERRY,What?
2,3,129,GEORGE,"Come on, it'll be so much easier."
2,3,129,JERRY,How you gonna get me up there?
2,3,129,GEORGE,"I'll tell her I bumped into you, I'm giving you a ride uptown."
2,3,129,JERRY,And who makes the switch?
2,3,129,GEORGE,You do.
2,3,129,JERRY,I do.
2,3,129,GEORGE,"I can't do it. I'll, I'll keep her busy."
2,3,129,JERRY,I can't get involved in this.
2,3,129,GEORGE,I think I may be in love with this woman.
2,3,129,JERRY,What if she sees me?
2,3,129,GEORGE,"Oh, you are such a wuss."
2,3,129,JERRY,A wuss?
2,3,129,GEORGE,Yeah.
2,3,129,JERRY,Did you call me a wuss?
2,3,129,GEORGE,Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.
2,3,129,JERRY,"I got one problem: you're keeping her busy in the other room. Now,"
2,3,131,GEORGE,"A signal, right, erm, OK, er OK, the signal is, I'll call out 'Tippy"
2,3,132,JERRY,'Tippy Toe?' I don't think so.
2,3,132,GEORGE,You don't like 'Tippy toe?'
2,3,132,JERRY,No 'Tippy toe.'
2,3,132,GEORGE,"Alright, er, OK I got it, erm, I'll sing."
2,3,132,JERRY,What song?
2,3,132,GEORGE,"Erm, 'How do you solve a problem like Maria?'"
2,3,132,JERRY,What is that?
2,3,132,GEORGE,"Oh, it's a lovely song. How do you solve a problem like"
2,3,133,JERRY,Anything else?
2,3,133,GEORGE,You pick it.
2,3,133,JERRY,'Lemon Tree'
2,3,133,GEORGE,"Peter, Paul and Mary."
2,3,133,JERRY,"No, Trini Lopez."
2,3,133,BOTH,Lemon tree very pretty and a lemon flower
2,3,133,GEORGE,You got the tape?
2,3,133,JERRY,Standard. Micro.
2,3,133,GEORGE,How do you feel? Confident?
2,3,133,JERRY,Feel good.
2,3,133,GEORGE,You nervous?
2,3,133,JERRY,Not at all.
2,3,133,GEORGE,"Get up, get up, it's her. Oh, the hell with this, I'm scared to"
2,3,149,JERRY,Hey you two. I'm ready to go.
2,3,135,GEORGE,Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to call you
2,3,136,GEORGE,
2,3,136,CAROL,"Oh, that's so sweet."
2,3,136,GEORGE,"Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him"
2,3,138,JERRY,All the time.
2,3,138,CAROL,It's nice to meet you.
2,3,138,JERRY,Hi.
2,3,138,CAROL,"So, I'm starving. Where are we gonna eat?"
2,3,138,GEORGE,"You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a"
2,3,11,GEORGE,"So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there,"
2,3,140,GEORGE,I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we
2,3,141,CAROL,"You know, I think I will go upstairs. I can check my"
2,3,142,GEORGE,"Right, right."
2,3,143,CAROL,The bathroom's on the hall to the right.
2,3,143,JERRY,"Er, you know, why don't you go first, you just had a long trip."
2,3,143,CAROL,"No, I'm fine."
2,3,143,JERRY,"Uhmmm, you know, it's the damnedest thing, it went away."
2,3,143,CAROL,Oh that's weird.
2,3,143,GEORGE,"No, no that can happen. I've, er, I've read about that in medical"
2,3,144,CAROL,"Well, let me just check my messages, and we'll go."
2,3,144,GEORGE,"Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now."
2,3,144,CAROL,Sure.
2,3,144,GEORGE,"Please, this is very, very important."
2,3,17,JERRY,So you didn't ask?
2,3,17,GEORGE,"No, I froze."
2,3,17,JERRY,Counter.
2,3,17,GEORGE,"Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later I'm back in the office,"
2,3,146,CAROL,Now I know who you are. You're a comedian. I've seen
2,3,147,JERRY,Right. I am.
2,3,147,GEORGE,"Carol, that's so rude. Please, I'm serious, just for a moment, if"
2,3,21,JERRY,He said wuss?
2,3,21,GEORGE,"Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it."
2,3,21,JERRY,So you called.
2,3,21,GEORGE,"Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple,"
2,3,150,CAROL,That's what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the
2,3,23,JERRY,"Yeah, like a farm boy."
2,3,23,GEORGE,"Right. So I call her up, I tell her it's me, she gives me an"
2,3,24,JERRY,"Wow. Enthusiastic 'Hi!', that's beautiful."
2,3,24,GEORGE,"Oh, I don't get the enthusiastic 'Hi!', I'm outta there."
2,3,24,JERRY,"Alright, so you're chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic"
2,3,25,GEORGE,"So, we're talking, and I don't like to go too long before I ask them"
2,3,27,JERRY,And?
2,3,27,GEORGE,She bought.
2,3,27,JERRY,Great day in the morning.
2,3,27,GEORGE,Then I got off the phone right away.
2,3,27,JERRY,"Sure, it's like robbing a bank: you don't loiter around in front of"
2,3,28,GEORGE,"It's amazing: we, we both have dates on the same night. I can't"
2,3,30,GEORGE,I can't stand doing laundry. That's why I have forty pairs of
2,3,31,CAROL,You do not.
2,3,31,GEORGE,"Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying"
2,3,35,JERRY,"Come on, try it. Let me hear you try"
2,3,36,DONNA,That's Irish.
2,3,36,JERRY,"Irish, Scottish, what's the difference, lassie?"
2,3,37,DONNA,"So, er, thanks for dinner. It was great."
2,3,37,GEORGE,Yeah. We should do this again.
2,3,37,DONNA,Would you like to come upstairs for some coffee?
2,3,37,GEORGE,"Oh, no, thanks. I can't drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up."
2,3,37,DONNA,"So, um, OK."
2,3,37,DONNA,Goodnight.
2,3,37,GEORGE,"Yeah, take it easy."
2,3,39,DONNA,Thanks again for the movie.
2,3,39,JERRY,You're welcome.
2,3,39,DONNA,"I'd invite you up, but the place is being painted."
2,3,39,JERRY,"Oh, that's OK."
2,3,39,DONNA,Unless you want to go to your place.
2,3,39,JERRY,
2,3,40,GEORGE,"Take it easy, huh, take it easy."
2,3,40,JERRY,"I think if one's going to kill oneself, the least you could do is"
2,3,42,DONNA,Values are very important.
2,3,42,JERRY,"Oh, so important. So what are you doing Thursday night - you wanna"
2,3,43,DONNA,Thursday's great.
2,3,43,JERRY,"Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I"
2,3,44,DONNA,Are those Cotton Dockers?
2,3,44,JERRY,"Oh, I can't begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial."
2,3,44,DONNA,Really? I like that commercial.
2,3,44,JERRY,You like that commercial?
2,3,44,DONNA,"Yeah, it's clever."
2,3,44,JERRY,"Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing"
2,3,45,DONNA,"Yeah, that's the one."
2,3,45,JERRY,What could you possibly like about that?
2,3,45,DONNA,"I don't know, I like the guys."
2,3,45,JERRY,"Yeah, they're so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I"
2,3,47,DONNA,"Hey, I know guys like that. To me the dialogue rings true."
2,3,47,JERRY,Even if the dialogue did ring true. Even if
2,3,49,DONNA,That's the idea. That's what's clever about
2,3,50,JERRY,But they're talking about nothing.
2,3,50,DONNA,That's the point.
2,3,50,JERRY,I know the point.
2,3,50,DONNA,No one is telling you to like it.
2,3,50,JERRY,"I mean, all those quick shots of the pants, just pants, pants,"
2,3,163,THE END,
2,3,59,JERRY,"I'm supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with"
2,3,60,ELAINE,I once broke up with a guy because he didn't keep his bathroom clean
2,3,61,JERRY,No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?
2,3,61,ELAINE,"Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his"
2,3,61,TUB,germs were building a town in there - they were constructing offices.
2,3,63,ELAINE,Hi.
2,3,65,JERRY,You're still thinking about this?
2,3,65,GEORGE,She invites me up at twelve o clock at
2,3,139,CAROL,
2,3,139,GEORGE,Don't you wanna go upstairs first?
2,3,139,CAROL,"No, what for? I'll just give my bag to the doorman."
2,3,139,JERRY,"You know, I really need to use the bathroom."
2,3,139,CAROL,Oh well there's a bathroom in the coffee shop just next door.
2,3,139,GEORGE,"Yes, yes, but er, I have to make a call, so..."
2,3,139,CAROL,Well they have a phone.
2,3,69,JERRY,She thinks you're a guy that doesn't like coffee.
2,3,69,GEORGE,"She invited me up. Coffee's not coffee, coffee is sex."
2,3,69,ELAINE,Maybe coffee was coffee.
2,3,69,GEORGE,"Coffee's coffee in the morning, it's not coffee at twelve o clock at"
2,3,70,ELAINE,Well some people drink coffee that late.
2,3,70,GEORGE,"Yeah, people who work at NORAD, who're on twenty-four hour missile"
2,3,71,ELAINE,It's all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I
2,3,72,GEORGE,"I can't call her now, it's too soon. I'm planning a Wednesday call."
2,3,72,ELAINE,"Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day."
2,3,72,GEORGE,"Of course you do, but you're imagining a guy you like, not a guy who"
2,3,76,ELAINE,All she'll think is that you like her.
2,3,76,GEORGE,"Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me, but she doesn't like"
2,3,77,ELAINE,I don't know what your parents did to you.
2,3,78,KRAMER,"Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. Alright,"
2,3,83,JERRY,I don't think so.
2,3,83,KRAMER,It's funny.
2,3,83,ELAINE,It is funny.
2,3,83,KRAMER,That's as good as anything you do.
2,3,83,GEORGE,"Alright, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on."
2,3,83,JERRY,Why do we have to leave?
2,3,83,GEORGE,Because I can't call a woman with other people in the room. Come
2,3,84,ELAINE,"Oh, see, this is the problem."
2,3,84,JERRY,You're kicking me out of my house?
2,3,84,GEORGE,Yes.
2,3,84,ELAINE,Don't forget.
2,3,84,GEORGE,"Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?"
2,3,84,JERRY,Don't do the apples. That's enough already with the apples.
2,3,85,PHONE,"Hi, it's Carol, I 'll get back to you."
2,3,85,GEORGE,"Uhm, hi, it's George, George Costanza, remember me? The guy that"
2,3,153,GEORGE,"Oh, uhhh..."
2,3,153,CAROL,"Yours were hilarious, we were both cracking up. I just love jokes"
2,3,91,JERRY,"I'm just gonna get my jacket, I'll meet you downstairs. What's the"
2,3,93,GEORGE,"Got her machine. I'm dead, I'm a dead man. That's it. I'm dead,"
2,3,94,JERRY,What did you say?
2,3,94,GEORGE,I don't know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and
2,3,95,NOW,"'Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiot's on!'"
2,3,95,JERRY,After one date you try and improvise on her machine?
2,3,95,GEORGE,Now I'm in the worst position of all.
2,3,95,ELAINE,"Y'know, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guy's machine,"
2,3,98,GEORGE,He did that?
2,3,98,ELAINE,Yeah.
2,3,98,GEORGE,Somebody did that?
2,3,98,JERRY,She'll call you back. You're overreacting.
2,3,98,JERRY,Not once.
2,3,98,DONNA,Never?
2,3,98,JERRY,I have never seen one episode of 'I Love Lucy' in my life ever.
2,3,98,DONNA,That's amazing.
2,3,98,JERRY,Thank you.
2,3,98,DONNA,Is there anything else about you I should know?
2,3,98,JERRY,"Yes, I'm lactose intolerant."
2,3,98,DONNA,Really?
2,3,98,JERRY,"I have no patience for lactose. And I won't stand for it. Uhm,"
2,3,100,GEORGE,"Wait till you hear this . Whoa, ah, I'm sorry, I"
2,3,101,DONNA,"Wait, wait. He's in the bathroom."
2,3,101,GEORGE,"I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but I'll come back."
2,3,101,DONNA,You don't have to leave.
2,3,101,GEORGE,You sure?
2,3,101,DONNA,Yes.
2,3,101,DONNA,I'm Donna.
2,3,101,GEORGE,"Donna. Oh, you're the one that likes that commercial!"
2,3,101,DONNA,He told you about that.
2,3,101,GEORGE,"No, he, he didn't actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about"
2,3,145,GEORGE,"Uhh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon tree!"
2,3,105,DONNA,So you go around telling your friends I'm not hip
2,3,106,JERRY,"What? What did, what did you say?"
2,3,106,GEORGE,"Say? What? Nothing, I.."
2,3,106,DONNA,You told him how I like the commercial.
2,3,106,JERRY,"Well, so what if I said that?"
2,3,106,DONNA,"Well, so, you didn't have to tell your friends."
2,3,106,JERRY,"No, I had to tell my friends, my friends didn't have to tell you."
2,3,106,GEORGE,Why did you have to get me in trouble?
2,3,106,DONNA,I don't like you talking about me with your friends behind my back.
2,3,106,GEORGE,Boy oh boy.
2,3,106,JERRY,I said I couldn't believe you liked that commercial. So what?
2,3,106,DONNA,"I asked some friends of mine this week, and all of them liked the"
2,3,107,JERRY,"Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there."
2,3,109,JERRY,"Oh, Kramer, this is Donna."
2,3,110,GEORGE,"Hello! Alright, we should be going. Come on ."
2,3,111,GEORGE,Come on!
2,3,111,DONNA,"Don't bother, I'm leaving."
2,3,111,JERRY,"Donna, really, you're making too much of this."
2,3,113,JERRY,"Please, Donna."
2,3,113,DONNA,I don't wanna hear it.
2,3,113,GEORGE,"I can't believe I said that. You know me, I'm a vault."
2,3,113,JERRY,"Don't worry about it, it wasn't working anyway."
2,3,114,JERRY,I'll tell you later.
2,3,114,GEORGE,You are not gonna believe what's going on with this woman.
2,3,114,GEORGE,
2,3,115,MACHINE AGAIN,
2,3,120,JERRY,You said that?
2,3,120,GEORGE,I lost it.
2,3,120,JERRY,I can't blame you. I can't believe she never called you back.
2,3,120,GEORGE,She did. Today.
2,3,120,JERRY,What?
2,3,120,GEORGE,She called my office. She said she's been in the Hamptons since
2,3,151,GEORGE,Don't you find that strange?
2,3,151,JERRY,Yes.
2,3,151,CAROL,"Well, I'll just check my machine and we'll go. No, nothing here,"
2,3,123,JERRY,So she didn't get the messages.
2,3,123,GEORGE,"Exactly, but they're on there waiting. She said she can't wait to"
2,3,125,JERRY,But what about the messages?
2,3,126,JERRY,Elaine's thing? How you gonna get in?
2,3,126,GEORGE,I'll meet her outside the building.
2,3,126,JERRY,But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment she's going right
2,3,127,GEORGE,Or she goes for the bathroom. That's my only chance. Who am I
