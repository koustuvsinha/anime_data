2,6,0,LEVITAN,Remind me to tell you what we did in Lake George. Get
2,6,1,GEORGE,That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm gone.
2,6,6,KRAMER,Hey.
2,6,6,JERRY,Hey.
2,6,6,KRAMER,"Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last"
2,6,8,JERRY,"Well, what'd you say?"
2,6,8,KRAMER,"I said "" Jump."" Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I"
2,6,10,JERRY,What's his problem?
2,6,10,KRAMER,No job. No women.
2,6,10,JERRY,He called the right guy.
2,6,10,KRAMER,What am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live
2,6,11,JERRY,"All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry."
2,6,11,KRAMER,Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?
2,6,11,JERRY,Fluff and fold. The only way to live. (snapping fingers in tune with
2,6,12,KRAMER,How 'bout if I put a few things --
2,6,12,JERRY,Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --
2,6,12,KRAMER,"Well, you're going over there."
2,6,12,JERRY,I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your guys. You
2,6,14,KRAMER,Have you ever met my guys?
2,6,14,JERRY,No. I can't say as I have.
2,6,14,KRAMER,Well!
2,6,14,JERRY,All right. Put 'em on top.
2,6,14,KRAMER,Ah!
2,6,14,JERRY,"Oh, beautiful. This stuff on top is my friends'. Could I get it done"
2,6,15,VIC,I'll have to charge you for another machine.
2,6,15,JERRY,"Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines are"
2,6,17,GEORGE,Guess what.
2,6,17,JERRY,How did you know I was here?
2,6,17,GEORGE,Kramer. Guess what.
2,6,17,JERRY,I don't know.
2,6,17,GEORGE,I quit my job.
2,6,17,JERRY,Get outta here.
2,6,17,GEORGE,I couldn't take it anymore.
2,6,17,VIC,You can have this on Monday.
2,6,17,JERRY,What happened? Levitan?
2,6,17,GEORGE,"I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then I"
2,6,19,JERRY,You and your toilets.
2,6,19,GEORGE,I snapped! It was the last straw.
2,6,19,JERRY,"So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something else"
2,6,20,GEORGE,Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible.
2,6,20,JERRY,So what are you gonna do?
2,6,20,GEORGE,I like sports. I could do something in sports.
2,6,20,JERRY,Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In what capacity?
2,6,20,GEORGE,"You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something."
2,6,20,JERRY,"Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get."
2,6,20,GEORGE,"Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could"
2,6,22,JERRY,Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments.
2,6,22,GEORGE,What about that?
2,6,22,JERRY,"Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that"
2,6,23,GEORGE,"Well, that's really not fair."
2,6,23,JERRY,"I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?"
2,6,23,GEORGE,Movies. I like to watch movies.
2,6,23,JERRY,Yeah. Yeah.
2,6,23,GEORGE,Do they pay people to watch movies?
2,6,23,JERRY,Projectionists.
2,6,23,GEORGE,That's true.
2,6,23,JERRY,But you gotta know how to work the projector.
2,6,23,GEORGE,Right.
2,6,23,JERRY,And it's probably a union thing.
2,6,23,GEORGE,"Those unions. Okay. Sports,...movies. What about a"
2,6,24,JERRY,Talk show host. That's good.
2,6,24,GEORGE,I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone
2,6,25,JERRY,Really?
2,6,25,GEORGE,"Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you"
2,6,26,JERRY,"Well, that's where it gets tricky."
2,6,26,GEORGE,"You can't just walk into a building and say "" I wanna be a talk"
2,6,27,JERRY,I wouldn't think so.
2,6,27,GEORGE,It's all politics.
2,6,27,JERRY,"All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?"
2,6,27,GEORGE,This could have been a huge mistake.
2,6,27,JERRY,"Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through."
2,6,27,GEORGE,What should I do?
2,6,27,JERRY,Maybe you can just go back.
2,6,27,GEORGE,Go back?
2,6,27,JERRY,Yeah. Pretend like it never happened.
2,6,27,GEORGE,You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it
2,6,28,JERRY,Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you seriously.
2,6,28,GEORGE,Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened.
2,6,28,JERRY,Never happened.
2,6,28,GEORGE,I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?
2,6,28,JERRY,So what? You're entitled.
2,6,28,GEORGE,I'm emotional.
2,6,28,JERRY,That's right. You're emotional.
2,6,28,GEORGE,Never happened.
2,6,28,JERRY,Never happened.
2,6,28,GEORGE,How ya doin'?
2,6,28,GLENDA,What are you doing here?
2,6,28,GEORGE,What? I work here.
2,6,28,GLENDA,I thought you quit.
2,6,28,GEORGE,What quit? Who quit?
2,6,28,DAN,"Bill, how was your weekend?"
2,6,28,BILL,"Oh, excellent weekend. What about your weekend?"
2,6,28,DAN,Fine weekend.
2,6,28,GEORGE,Yeah. Good weekend.
2,6,28,DAN,Went up to the Cape. Took the kids sailing. Lisa was a
2,6,30,GEORGE,"Aw, she's gonna be a fine sailor."
2,6,30,LEVITAN,"Ava, what happened to you Friday afternoon?"
2,6,30,AVA,I got a little tied up.
2,6,30,LEVITAN,I'll bet you did.
2,6,31,LEVITAN,I wanna remind everyone that the tenth anniversary party for Rick
2,6,35,GEORGE,What?
2,6,35,LEVITAN,"Am I crazy, or didn't you quit?"
2,6,35,GEORGE,When?
2,6,35,LEVITAN,Friday.
2,6,35,GEORGE,"Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? You"
2,6,36,LEVITAN,"You mean, laughingstock? All that stuff?"
2,6,36,GEORGE,Come on. Will you stop it.
2,6,36,LEVITAN,No brains? No ability?
2,6,36,GEORGE,Teasing.
2,6,36,LEVITAN,Okay. I want you outta here.
2,6,36,GEORGE,I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're serious
2,6,37,LEVITAN,You can't win. You can't beat me. That's why I'm here and you're
2,6,39,GEORGE,""" I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser."" This is"
2,6,40,JERRY,"Well, so that's that."
2,6,40,GEORGE,No. That's not that.
2,6,40,JERRY,That's not that?
2,6,40,GEORGE,No.
2,6,40,JERRY,"Well, if that's not that, what is that?"
2,6,40,GEORGE,I've got some plans. I got plans.
2,6,40,JERRY,What kind of plans?
2,6,40,GEORGE,What's the difference?
2,6,40,JERRY,You don't wanna tell me?
2,6,40,GEORGE,I'm gonna slip him a mickey.
2,6,40,JERRY,What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What? Are you Peter
2,6,41,GEORGE,You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. He's been
2,6,43,JERRY,What if you destroy him?
2,6,43,GEORGE,No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I researched
2,6,44,JERRY,"Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal."
2,6,44,GEORGE,This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful thing!
2,6,45,JERRY,You've really gone mental.
2,6,45,GEORGE,Nah.
2,6,45,JERRY,Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm saying
2,6,46,GEORGE,I got a sauce.
2,6,46,JERRY,You got a mickey sauce?
2,6,46,GEORGE,And Elaine is gonna keep him busy.
2,6,46,JERRY,Elaine? How did you rope her into this?
2,6,46,GEORGE,I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife.
2,6,46,JERRY,She knew that.
2,6,46,GEORGE,But she didn't know he doesn't recycle.
2,6,46,JERRY,What is the point of all this?
2,6,46,GEORGE,Revenge.
2,6,46,JERRY,"Oh, the best revenge is living well."
2,6,46,GEORGE,There's no chance of that.
2,6,46,JERRY,Did you get your laundry?
2,6,46,KRAMER,Yeah.
2,6,46,JERRY,What's with you?
2,6,46,KRAMER,He jumped.
2,6,46,JERRY,What?
2,6,46,KRAMER,Yeah. Newman jumped.
2,6,46,JERRY,Did he call you last night?
2,6,46,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
2,6,46,JERRY,What did you say?
2,6,46,KRAMER,"I said "" Wave to me when you pass my window."""
2,6,46,JERRY,Whew. Did he wave?
2,6,46,KRAMER,No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous saw him from
2,6,48,JERRY,"Oh, my god!"
2,6,48,KRAMER,What's the matter?
2,6,48,JERRY,"Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some"
2,6,51,KRAMER,Where? Where?
2,6,51,JERRY,To the Laundromat.
2,6,51,VIC,I never saw it.
2,6,51,KRAMER,Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are you doing?
2,6,51,VIC,"Hey, you see that sign right there?"
2,6,51,JERRY,"Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want?"
2,6,51,VIC,I'm not responsible.
2,6,51,JERRY,"So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it? You have a"
2,6,52,VIC,You ever hear of a bank?
2,6,52,JERRY,Come on. Let's go.
2,6,52,KRAMER,No. You can't let him get away with this.
2,6,52,ELAINE,Which one is he?
2,6,52,GEORGE,That's him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish.
2,6,52,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah. I see him."
2,6,52,GEORGE,"Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing this."
2,6,52,ELAINE,Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison?
2,6,52,GEORGE,This is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done.
2,6,52,ELAINE,Yeah. It is kind of cool.
2,6,52,GEORGE,First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone.
2,6,52,ELAINE,I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing they do
2,6,53,GEORGE,That's exactly what I told Jerry!
2,6,53,ELAINE,Really?
2,6,53,GEORGE,Yes!
2,6,54,GEORGE,"God, I've never felt so alive!"
2,6,54,JERRY,Maybe we should call this off.
2,6,54,KRAMER,Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete in
2,6,55,JERRY,And what's gonna happen?
2,6,55,KRAMER,"Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the"
2,6,56,JERRY,If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. You're like
2,6,57,KRAMER,You keep him busy.
2,6,60,KRAMER,Whoa!
2,6,62,GEORGE,You go over there -
2,6,62,ELAINE,Yeah.
2,6,62,GEORGE,"You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while you're"
2,6,63,ELAINE,Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth?
2,6,63,LEVITAN,Come on! They're terrible. They got no infield.
2,6,63,ELAINE,Oops! 'Scuse me.
2,6,63,LEVITAN,Yeah.
2,6,63,GREENY,I'm gonna get some food. You want some?
2,6,63,LEVITAN,Nah.
2,6,63,ELAINE,Hi.
2,6,63,LEVITAN,Hi.
2,6,63,ELAINE,
2,6,63,LEVITAN,God bless you.
2,6,63,ELAINE,Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. Really. I mean
2,6,66,LEVITAN,You're welcome.
2,6,66,ELAINE,"People don't say "" God bless you "" as much as they used to. Have"
2,6,67,LEVITAN,No.
2,6,67,ELAINE,"So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week."
2,6,67,LEVITAN,Nudist colony?
2,6,67,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah!"
2,6,67,LEVITAN,I'd never been to a nudist colony.
2,6,67,ELAINE,"Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of"
2,6,70,LEVITAN,Seriously?
2,6,70,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day."
2,6,70,GEORGE,"Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have this seat?"
2,6,70,GLENDA,What do you have to sit here for? There are plenty of other seats.
2,6,70,GEORGE,I can't explain. It's very important that I sit here.
2,6,70,GLENDA,What are you doing here anyway? I thought you were fired.
2,6,70,GEORGE,Okay. Okay. Fine.
2,6,70,ELAINE,"I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked."
2,6,71,LEVITAN,Who are you?
2,6,71,ELAINE,"Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah. I'm trouble. Big trouble."
2,6,73,JERRY,What about the gentle cycle? You ever use that?
2,6,75,JERRY,Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle
2,6,77,JERRY,What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind of
2,6,83,JERRY,What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those? That must
2,6,87,KRAMER,I didn't realize it was a full box.
2,6,87,GEORGE,"I'm gonna count to three. If you don't give up the chair, the wig"
2,6,88,GLENDA,I don't' wear a wig.
2,6,88,GEORGE,One...
2,6,88,ELAINE,"No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, I - I"
2,6,90,ELAINE,I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever
2,6,94,GEORGE,"Hello, Rick."
2,6,94,LEVITAN,Heh heh heh hey! Look who's here!
2,6,94,GEORGE,"That's right, Ricky Boy, it's me!"
2,6,94,LEVITAN,"You know something, Costanza? I'm a very lucky man."
2,6,94,GEORGE,Oh!
2,6,94,LEVITAN,I've always been lucky. Things just seem to fall right in my lap.
2,6,94,GEORGE,Boom!
2,6,95,LEVITAN,"You wouldn't believe it if I told you. In fact, uh, I'm glad"
2,6,96,GEORGE,Oh.
2,6,96,LEVITAN,"Why should we let petty, personal differences get in the way of"
2,6,98,GEORGE,You want me to come back? Uh...
2,6,98,LEVITAN,"Hey! How about a toast, huh? Everybody, a toast!"
2,6,98,GEORGE,Rick.
2,6,98,LEVITAN,"Everyone, I wanna propose a toast to ten great years at Rick Barr"
2,6,99,GEORGE,"Uh, Rick.."
2,6,99,LEVITAN,"And all the people in this room, that made that"
2,6,100,GEORGE,Rick.
2,6,100,LEVITAN,I'd also like to welcome back into the fold our..our little
2,6,104,GEORGE,"Drink up. I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a professor,"
2,6,105,ELAINE,"Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. I"
2,6,106,JERRY,"Yeah. That's true. What? My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd you"
2,6,107,KRAMER,It was in my laundry.
2,6,107,JERRY,In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys.
2,6,108,KRAMER,It was about 1200 bucks.
2,6,108,NEWMAN,Kramer!
2,6,108,KRAMER,Oh! That's Newman.
2,6,108,NEWMAN,I'm on the roof!
2,6,108,KRAMER,"Well, what are you waiting for?"
2,6,108,JERRY,"Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. I gotta"
2,6,109,GEORGE,I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy.
2,6,109,KRAMER,You wanna shoot some pool tonight?
2,6,109,NEWMAN,I can't. I'm goin' to the movies.
2,6,109,GEORGE,Nah. It's probably a union thing.
2,6,109,THE END,
