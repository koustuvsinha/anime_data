3,1,24,ELAINE,I don't blame ya'
3,1,24,JERRY,Have you ever been through an audit?
3,1,24,ELAINE,No.
3,1,24,JERRY,It's hell. It's the financial equivalent of a complete rectal

3,1,27,JERRY,"Come up - Ah, there he is, the man himself, George Louis Costanza. Here I am about to go"

3,1,30,JERRY,I'm being audited! And you broke up with her?
3,1,30,GEORGE,It's OK. It's fine. She'll do it. I'm sure she'll still do it.
3,1,30,JERRY,Why will she still do it? She hates you now. People don't do you favors after you dump
3,1,31,GEORGE,"Oh, no. We left on good terms."
3,1,31,JERRY,How is that possible?
3,1,31,GEORGE,"Because I uh, I told her the truth."
3,1,31,JERRY,"Oh, my God."
3,1,31,GEORGE,It's OK.
3,1,31,JERRY,It's unheard of ...
3,1,31,GEORGE,She asked me to.
3,1,31,JERRY,So you lie! What did you tell her?
3,1,31,GEORGE,I told her that she was pretentious.
3,1,31,JERRY,Pretentious!? The woman has my tax papers. You told her she was
3,1,33,ELAINE,How would you like it if someone told YOU the truth?
3,1,33,GEORGE,Like what? What could they say?

3,1,34,JERRY,"Yeah, I know champagne, limos, cigars. WHAT happened to the papers?"
3,1,34,GEORGE,She put them in her pocketbook. I guess she took them with her.
3,1,34,ELAINE,Pocketbook or a handbag?

3,1,46,JERRY,"Well, what happened? Was she there?"
3,1,46,GEORGE,"No, no she wasn't."
3,1,46,JERRY,You didn't get my papers?

3,1,46,JERRY,"Well, where is she?"
3,1,46,GEORGE,A mental institution.
3,1,57,JERRY,A mental institution?
3,1,57,KRAMER,You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoo's Nest? They put those electrodes in
3,1,58,GEORGE,It's not really a mental institution. It's more like a depression
3,1,60,ELAINE,Who told you this:
3,1,60,GEORGE,Her roommate. I've driven women to lesbianism before but never to a mental institution.
3,1,60,KRAMER,"My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses were so large, it had no effect."
3,1,60,JERRY,You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any
3,1,61,GEORGE,She put them in her pocket book. She probably took them out there with her.

3,1,61,JERRY,Can we go out there?
3,1,61,GEORGE,Where?
3,1,61,JERRY,Woodhaven.
3,1,61,GEORGE,We could.
3,1,62,GEORGE,I'm very nervous about this. I've never spoken to a mental patient before.

3,1,70,KRAMER,Hey.
3,1,70,KRAMER,"Uh, you want some leftovers? I made some African food. There's, yambalas and uh, sambusa."

3,1,70,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there baby."
3,1,70,TINA,"Oh, hi Elaine. What did you think of the coffee table?"
3,1,70,ELAINE,It's invisible.
3,1,70,KRAMER,"So, is everything cool? or what?"

3,1,71,GEORGE,"Oh, this is my friend Jerry."
3,1,71,PATRICE,Why are you talking like that? And what do YOU want?
3,1,71,JERRY,"Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came because I, I heard so many nice things"
3,1,72,PATRICE,George thinks I'm pretentious.
3,1,72,GEORGE,"Pretentious? Who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone who was"
3,1,74,PATRICE,You're just trying to take it all back because you're feeling guilty I'm in here.
3,1,74,GEORGE,"No, that's not it at all."
3,1,74,PATRICE,Don't LIE George.
3,1,74,GEORGE,"Uh, we're cool. Everything's cool"
3,1,74,JERRY,Just chatting. Friendly.
3,1,74,GEORGE,"All righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices."
3,1,74,PATRICE,I know what you said. You can't change that.
3,1,74,GEORGE,What I said? I saw stupid things all the time I can't go two minutes without saying stupid things.
3,1,74,JERRY,"It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, when you come to one of these places,"
3,1,75,GEORGE,"You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even know someone like you."
3,1,75,PATRICE,You mean that?
3,1,75,GEORGE,Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile.
3,1,75,JERRY,"He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important papers in their, uh, pocket book."
3,1,76,PATRICE,"Papers? Oh, Jerry, You're the Jerome with the tax problem. You know after that day with George I"
3,1,77,JERRY,there are no copies.
3,1,77,PATRICE,So are you saying you want to continue seeing me?
3,1,77,JERRY,Who makes copies?
3,1,78,ELAINE,The truth is ... I think you make ... a very nice couple.
3,1,79,KRAMER,"Oh,"
3,1,79,TINA,"Kramer,"
3,1,80,TINA,Here Kramer?
3,1,80,KRAMER,"No, lets go to the couch..."
3,1,82,JERRY,"Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer thatI bought there...."
3,1,84,JERRY,Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think I may have tracked down another receipt.
3,1,84,ELAINE,I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital.
3,1,84,JERRY,George?
3,1,84,GEORGE,"I'm going to a poetry reading with PATRICE: First time poets, in a burnt out building, down by the docks,"
3,1,86,KRAMER,"Hey, Are you going to the hospital now?"
3,1,86,ELAINE,"Yeah, I suppose I am."
3,1,86,KRAMER,"All right, great, great uh, we'll share a cab."
3,1,86,JERRY,You're going by 48th St. You can give me a ride.
3,1,86,GEORGE,"Hey, I'm getting in on that."
3,1,86,ELAINE,You know you're chippin' in.
3,1,86,GEORGE,You're going that way anyway!
