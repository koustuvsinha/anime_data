3,10,9,JERRY,Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front.
3,10,9,GEORGE,Was the alarm on?
3,10,9,JERRY,"I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not"
3,10,10,GEORGE,"I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?"
3,10,10,JERRY,They cross the wires or something.
3,10,10,GEORGE,Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.
3,10,11,JERRY,They stole my car.
3,10,11,KRAMER,Who did?
3,10,11,JERRY,They did.
3,10,11,KRAMER,Was it more than just one?
3,10,11,JERRY,"What should I do, should I call the police?"
3,10,11,KRAMER,What are they gonna do?
3,10,11,JERRY,"I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service."
3,10,11,GEORGE,Maybe you should call your car phone.
3,10,11,JERRY,"Yeah, he's probably driving it right now."
3,10,11,GEORGE,"Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens."
3,10,11,JERRY,Are you serious?
3,10,11,GEORGE,"Yeah, go ahead, call."
3,10,11,JERRY,I don't even know if I remember the number.
3,10,12,JERRY,What do I say if he picks up?
3,10,12,CAR THIEF,Hello?
3,10,12,JERRY,Hello? Is this 555-8383?
3,10,12,CAR THIEF,I have no idea.
3,10,12,JERRY,Can I ask you a question?
3,10,12,CAR THIEF,Sure.
3,10,12,JERRY,Did you steal my car?
3,10,12,CAR THIEF,Yes I did.
3,10,12,JERRY,You did?!
3,10,12,CAR THIEF,I did.
3,10,12,JERRY,That's my car!
3,10,12,CAR THIEF,I didn't know it was yours.
3,10,12,JERRY,What are you gonna do with it?
3,10,12,CAR THIEF,"I dunno, drive around."
3,10,12,JERRY,Then can I have it back?
3,10,12,CAR THIEF,"Mmmm, nah, I'm gonna keep it."
3,10,13,KRAMER,Hello?
3,10,13,CAR THIEF,"Yeah, who's this?"
3,10,13,KRAMER,Kramer.
3,10,13,CAR THIEF,"Hello, Kramer."
3,10,13,KRAMER,"Listen, there's a pair of gloves in the glove compartment."
3,10,13,CAR THIEF,"Wait, hold on... Brown ones?"
3,10,13,KRAMER,"Yeah. Listen, could you mail those to me? Or bring them by my"
3,10,14,CAR THIEF,"One-two-nine, okay."
3,10,14,KRAMER,"Thanks a lot, uh here's Jerry."
3,10,14,JERRY,Gloves. Hello?
3,10,14,CAR THIEF,Jerry?
3,10,14,JERRY,"Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?"
3,10,14,CAR THIEF,"I didn't cross any wires, the keys were in it."
3,10,14,JERRY,"Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully."
3,10,14,CAR THIEF,"Jerry, when's the last time you had a tune-up? Because I can't find"
3,10,16,JERRY,Sid left the keys in the car.
3,10,16,GEORGE,Who's Sid?
3,10,16,JERRY,"He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block."
3,10,16,GEORGE,What do you mean?
3,10,16,JERRY,He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get
3,10,17,GEORGE,"What, do you pay him for that?"
3,10,17,JERRY,"Yeah, like fifty bucks a month."
3,10,17,GEORGE,How many people does he do that for?
3,10,17,JERRY,"The whole block, forty, fifty cars."
3,10,17,KRAMER,He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been
3,10,18,GEORGE,Could anybody do that?
3,10,19,JERRY,"Hey Sid, what happened?"
3,10,19,SID,"I'm sorry, Jerry. Maybe I'm getting too old for this stuff."
3,10,19,JERRY,You left the keys in the car?
3,10,19,SID,"Well, you know they're making that Woody Allen movie in the block, and all"
3,10,21,KRAMER,You know I'm in that movie?
3,10,21,GEORGE,You are?
3,10,21,KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm an extra."
3,10,21,GEORGE,How'd you get that?
3,10,21,KRAMER,"Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked"
3,10,22,GEORGE,Right out of the clear blue sky?
3,10,22,KRAMER,Clear blue sky!
3,10,22,GEORGE,"Well, why didn't they ask me?"
3,10,22,KRAMER,I got a quality.
3,10,22,SID,"Jerry, you got insurance, right?"
3,10,22,JERRY,"Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one."
3,10,22,SID,"Well I'm going down to visit my sister in Virginia next Wednesday, for a"
3,10,23,JERRY,This Wednesday?
3,10,23,SID,"No, next Wednesday, week after this Wednesday."
3,10,23,JERRY,But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.
3,10,23,SID,"If I meant this Wednesday, I would have said this Wednesday. It's the"
3,10,24,GEORGE,"Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?"
3,10,24,SID,"Whoever wants to move them, why do I care who moves them? They can move"
3,10,25,GEORGE,Maybe I could move them until you get back.
3,10,25,SID,What's a young man like you want to move cars for? You don't work?
3,10,25,GEORGE,I'm in a transition phase right now.
3,10,25,SID,"Well if you want to move the cars, move the cars. Just don't forget to"
3,10,27,JERRY,"Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all"
3,10,29,ELAINE,"I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading"
3,10,30,JERRY,"Owen March, I never heard of him."
3,10,30,ELAINE,"Well, he's not a baseball player."
3,10,30,JERRY,"Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good."
3,10,30,ELAINE,"Yeah. Well, there is one little problem."
3,10,30,JERRY,What's that?
3,10,30,ELAINE,He's sixty-six years old.
3,10,30,RENTAL CAR AGENT,Next please.
3,10,30,ELAINE,"Well, go, go."
3,10,30,AGENT,Can I help you? Name please?
3,10,30,JERRY,"Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm"
3,10,31,AGENT,"Okay, let's see here."
3,10,31,JERRY,Sixty-six years old?
3,10,31,ELAINE,"Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd"
3,10,32,JERRY,"Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would I like him?"
3,10,32,ELAINE,"What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman?"
3,10,32,JERRY,"Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant,"
3,10,33,AGENT,"I'm sorry, we have no mid-size available at the moment."
3,10,33,JERRY,"I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?"
3,10,33,AGENT,"Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of cars."
3,10,33,JERRY,But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the
3,10,34,AGENT,I know why we have reservations.
3,10,34,JERRY,"I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to"
3,10,37,AGENT,"Let me, uh, speak with my supervisor."
3,10,39,JERRY,"Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?"
3,10,39,ELAINE,What?
3,10,39,JERRY,"Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think I'm talking"
3,10,40,ELAINE,"Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm"
3,10,41,JERRY,Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought
3,10,42,ELAINE,"Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later."
3,10,43,AGENT,"I'm sorry, my supervisor says there's nothing we can do."
3,10,43,JERRY,"Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there."
3,10,43,AGENT,But we do have a compact if you would like that.
3,10,43,JERRY,Fine.
3,10,43,AGENT,Alright. We have a blue Ford Escort for you Mr. Seinfeld. Would you
3,10,44,JERRY,"Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell"
3,10,45,AGENT,Please fill this out.
3,10,45,ELAINE,"What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?"
3,10,45,JERRY,"Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important."
3,10,45,ELAINE,"I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being"
3,10,47,ELAINE,I just don't enjoy being with him.
3,10,47,JERRY,Well that's what's important.
3,10,47,ELAINE,"I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to"
3,10,48,JERRY,How many times you been out with him?
3,10,48,ELAINE,Seven?
3,10,48,JERRY,Face to face.
3,10,48,ELAINE,Seven dates is a face-to-face break up?
3,10,48,JERRY,"If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over"
3,10,49,ELAINE,Hmm... How's the pasta over there?
3,10,51,KRAMER,"Whoa, whoa!!"
3,10,51,JERRY,What is going on out there?
3,10,51,GEORGE,"I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm"
3,10,54,KRAMER,"Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today?"
3,10,54,ELAINE,Today?!
3,10,54,KRAMER,You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block
3,10,55,ELAINE,Yeah.
3,10,55,KRAMER,"So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and"
3,10,56,ELAINE,He was laughing?!
3,10,56,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose."
3,10,56,JERRY,So then what?
3,10,56,KRAMER,I got a line in the movie!
3,10,56,ELAINE,Get out!
3,10,56,JERRY,That's great!
3,10,56,GEORGE,You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?
3,10,56,KRAMER,"Pretty good, huh?"
3,10,56,GEORGE,You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?
3,10,56,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new career on my"
3,10,57,JERRY,You mean *a* career.
3,10,57,ELAINE,So was Mia Farrow there?
3,10,57,KRAMER,"Uh, I didn't see him."
3,10,57,ELAINE,What's your line?
3,10,57,KRAMER,"Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm at this bar"
3,10,59,KRAMER,"So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go,"
3,10,60,GEORGE,Is that how you're gonna say it?
3,10,60,KRAMER,"No, no, I'm working on it."
3,10,60,ELAINE,"Do it like this. ""These pretzels are making me thirsty."""
3,10,60,JERRY,"No. ""These pretzels are making me thirsty."""
3,10,60,KRAMER,"No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to act."
3,10,60,GEORGE,"""These pretzels are making me thirsty!!"""
3,10,61,GEORGE,That was no good?
3,10,61,KRAMER,I didn't say anything.
3,10,61,ELAINE,I'm gonna go break up with Owen.
3,10,61,GEORGE,What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you
3,10,69,JERRY,Oh my god.
3,10,69,ELAINE,Call an ambulance.
3,10,69,JERRY,"Boy, he took it hard."
3,10,70,ELAINE,We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about
3,10,71,JERRY,"Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west"
3,10,72,ELAINE,Tell then to hurry! Hurry!
3,10,72,JERRY,It's an ambulance. I don't know but he's
3,10,74,KRAMER,"These pretzels are making me thirsty. Boy,"
3,10,75,JERRY,Kramer.
3,10,75,KRAMER,What happened here?
3,10,75,ELAINE,"I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance,"
3,10,76,JERRY,Shouldn't you do something with the extremities?
3,10,76,ELAINE,What extremities?
3,10,76,KRAMER,What's an extremity?
3,10,76,JERRY,"You raise the feet, get blood to the head."
3,10,76,KRAMER,"You raise the head, you get blood to the feet."
3,10,76,ELAINE,"Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that."
3,10,76,JERRY,I don't have a washcloth.
3,10,76,ELAINE,Well use a paper towel.
3,10,76,JERRY,You can't put a paper towel on his head.
3,10,76,KRAMER,What about a big sponge?
3,10,76,JERRY,How you gonna hold it on there?
3,10,76,KRAMER,Use a belt.
3,10,76,ELAINE,"No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him."
3,10,76,JERRY,Should we walk him around?
3,10,76,ELAINE AND KRAMER,"Yes, yes."
3,10,76,KRAMER,"Yeah, I've seen them do that."
3,10,76,JERRY,"No, no that's for a drug overdose."
3,10,76,KRAMER,Maybe that's what he's got.
3,10,76,ELAINE,"No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the"
3,10,77,KRAMER,Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.
3,10,77,ELAINE,He is not a drug addict!
3,10,77,JERRY,"Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie"
3,10,78,ELAINE,A cookie!
3,10,78,KRAMER,Can you give him a cookie?
3,10,78,ELAINE,How's he gonna chew it?
3,10,78,JERRY,"We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him."
3,10,79,ELAINE,"Careful, you're getting crumbs all over him."
3,10,79,KRAMER,I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.
3,10,79,ELAINE,"You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink"
3,10,80,JERRY,Cookies don't liquefy.
3,10,80,ELAINE,"Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie."
3,10,80,KRAMER,Alright I'll get a blender.
3,10,80,JERRY,What blender? I don't have a blender.
3,10,80,KRAMER,You got a blender.
3,10,80,JERRY,I would know if I had a blender.
3,10,80,ELAINE,Where is the ambulance?!
3,10,83,JERRY,"Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five"
3,10,84,ELAINE,I can't believe what's going on out here.
3,10,84,JERRY,"This is an emergency, what's taking so long?"
3,10,85,VOICE,Paramedics.
3,10,85,JERRY,"Come on up. Okay, they're here."
3,10,85,ELAINE,He seems to be breathing.
3,10,85,JERRY,"Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy."
3,10,85,ELAINE,I know.
3,10,85,JERRY,"Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?"
3,10,85,ELAINE,Almost.
3,10,85,JERRY,"Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there."
3,10,85,ELAINE,It's not an easy thing to bring up.
3,10,85,JERRY,"Yeah, that's true."
3,10,85,ELAINE,"Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk."
3,10,85,JERRY,Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.
3,10,85,ELAINE,"He does, how'd you know that?"
3,10,85,JERRY,I could tell.
3,10,86,ELAINE,"What happened, what took you so long?!"
3,10,86,PARAMEDIC,"We got here twenty minutes ago but we couldn't move, the whole"
3,10,89,JERRY,Blue Escort? That's my rent-a-car!
3,10,90,GEORGE,Oh man.
3,10,90,JERRY,What happened to the car?
3,10,90,GEORGE,"Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there!"
3,10,91,ELAINE,This guy I'm seeing.
3,10,91,GEORGE,What happened?
3,10,91,JERRY,We don't know!
3,10,91,PARAMEDIC,Who put cookies in his mouth?
3,10,91,JERRY AND ELAINE,Cookies?
3,10,91,PARAMEDIC,You're not supposed to do that.
3,10,91,JERRY,So how'd you hit the car?
3,10,91,GEORGE,"I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen"
3,10,92,JERRY,"It's not even my car, it's a rental."
3,10,93,KRAMER,What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the
3,10,94,GEORGE,Woody mentioned me? What did he say?
3,10,94,KRAMER,"He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all"
3,10,95,GEORGE,Should I apologize to Woody?
3,10,95,KRAMER,"Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring"
3,10,103,SID,Now you didn't tell me you didn't know how to drive. You should have
3,10,104,GEORGE,Well I know how to drive.
3,10,104,SID,Then how'd all those cars get damaged? Why are people calling me up
3,10,105,JERRY,Can I get anybody anything?
3,10,105,SID,Moving cars from one side of the street to the other don't take no more
3,10,107,GEORGE,"I put my pants on, Sid."
3,10,107,SID,"I don't believe you. If you can put your pants on, you can move those"
3,10,108,GEORGE,Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.
3,10,108,SID,Who's gonna send money to my sister in Virginia? Her little boy needs
3,10,110,GEORGE,Maybe I could call my father.
3,10,111,KRAMER,"Hey, you seen the paper yet?"
3,10,111,JERRY,"Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper."
3,10,111,KRAMER,Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.
3,10,113,KRAMER,"Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend."
3,10,113,JERRY,The extent of the damage would have been far less severe
3,10,114,SID,Oh lord.
3,10,114,JERRY,The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie
3,10,119,ELAINE,"Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with"
3,10,120,JERRY,Can he communicate?
3,10,120,ELAINE,"Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy"
3,10,121,JERRY,"Alright, she's free. Hi, I called before,"
3,10,122,ELAINE,"So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll"
3,10,124,JERRY,What community? There's a community?
3,10,124,ELAINE,Of course there's a community.
3,10,124,JERRY,"All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea."
3,10,124,AGENT,Sir the estimate on the damage to your car is two thousand eight hundred
3,10,125,JERRY,"Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so..."
3,10,125,AGENT,"Yes, now, uh, in your report you said that you were not the driver of"
3,10,126,JERRY,"That is right, somebody else was driving."
3,10,126,AGENT,"Alright, well, sir, you're only covered for when you're driving the car."
3,10,126,JERRY,"Uh huh, what's that?"
3,10,126,AGENT,You're not covered for other drivers.
3,10,126,JERRY,Other drivers?
3,10,126,AGENT,Um hm.
3,10,126,JERRY,Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car.
3,10,128,AGENT,Not that particular one.
3,10,128,JERRY,"Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you"
3,10,129,AGENT,"Sir, if you had read the rental agreement--"
3,10,129,JERRY,Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of
3,10,130,AGENT,"Mr. Seinfeld, as it stands right now, you are not covered for that"
3,10,131,JERRY,These pretzels are making me thirsty.
3,10,133,ELAINE,"Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't"
3,10,148,ELAINE,"Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a"
3,10,149,JERRY,An overdose of odor? Good question.
3,10,149,GEORGE,Do I smell?
3,10,149,ELAINE,"No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today,"
3,10,150,JERRY,Ahh.
3,10,150,GEORGE,He's alright?
3,10,150,ELAINE,"Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for"
3,10,152,JERRY,Let me get that.
3,10,152,GEORGE,"No no no, I got it."
3,10,152,JERRY,Please.
3,10,152,GEORGE,"No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two"
3,10,153,JERRY,"Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it."
3,10,154,JERRY,What are you doing here?
3,10,154,KRAMER,I got fired from the movie.
3,10,154,GEORGE,"Get out of here, why?"
3,10,154,KRAMER,"Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it"
3,10,157,ELAINE,Aww.
3,10,157,KRAMER,"Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And"
3,10,160,JERRY,"Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud."
3,10,168,THE END,
