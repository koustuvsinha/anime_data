3,13,13,GEORGE,"What the Hell is a ""Polar Bear""?"
3,13,13,KRAMER,"Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating...."
3,13,13,JERRY,Yeah... So's shock therapy.
3,13,13,JERRY,"What is that, a Pez dispenser?!"
3,13,13,KRAMER,"Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at the Flea Market."
3,13,13,GEORGE,"Hey, what goes on there, exactly?"

3,13,13,GEORGE,"No, I-I-I know... I know..."

3,13,14,GEORGE,"All right, I think they have fleas there. So what..."
3,13,14,ELAINELAINE,I don't know how anyone does this. It must be so nerve racking...
3,13,15,JERRY,They have a piano backstage they warm up on.
3,13,15,ELAINELAINE,"No, we would have heard it."
3,13,15,JERRY,"What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?"
3,13,15,GEORGE,"I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud"
3,13,16,JERRY,I resent that you said that! That's
3,13,18,JERRY,Is this okay? Can I do this?
3,13,18,STEVE,Something I said? It's John... Mollika.
3,13,18,ELAINELAINE,"Oh, oh, John... Oh, hi John... Hi..."
3,13,18,STEVE,What're you doing down here?
3,13,18,ELAINE,"Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I"
3,13,19,MOLLIKA,Jerry's in there? I heard you guys broke up.
3,13,19,ELAINE,We did. We're just hanging out.
3,13,19,MOLLIKA,REally. ... You really look great.
3,13,19,ELAINE,"Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?"
3,13,19,MOLLIKA,"Oh, Richie, he's been doing comedy in L. A. for a few years. He"
3,13,21,ELAINE,Have you thought about an intervention?
3,13,21,MOLLIKA,What's that?
3,13,21,ELAINE,"You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get"
3,13,22,MOLLIKA,He'd never listen to anyone. ... Except of course Jerry. He'd listen to
3,13,25,ELAINELAINE,"I'm sorry. George, I'm sorry!"
3,13,25,GEORGE,What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first
3,13,26,JERRY,"I dunno, it was an impulse."
3,13,26,GEORGE,What kind of a sick impulse does that??
3,13,26,JERRY,How could I know she would start to laugh?
3,13,26,ELAINELAINE,I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I am!
3,13,26,JERRY,Can we just go in already?
3,13,26,GEORGE,What are we gonna tell her?
3,13,26,ELAINELAINE,I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
3,13,26,GEORGE,"No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then"
3,13,27,ELAINELAINE,"Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later."
3,13,27,JERRY,What about?
3,13,27,GEORGE,"Hey, hey! We're discussing something!"
3,13,27,JERRY,"I know, but I'm distracted now."
3,13,27,GEORGE,What are you? A baby!? All right. Tell her.
3,13,28,JERRY,"Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's he doing?"
3,13,28,ELAINE,He's good.
3,13,28,GEORGE,"Uh, can we cut to the chase?"
3,13,28,JERRY,"""Cut to the chase""?"
3,13,28,GEORGE,Yeah...
3,13,28,JERRY,"What're you, ""Joe Hollywood""?"
3,13,28,GEORGE,A lot of people say it.
3,13,28,JERRY,I would lose that.
3,13,28,GEORGE,What's that?
3,13,28,JERRY,"""Lose that""? That's not a Hollywood expression!"
3,13,28,GEORGE,...Yes it is.
3,13,28,ELAINE,Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from
3,13,30,JERRY,"Really, an intervention ..."
3,13,30,GEORGE,"Y'know people, we got a situation over here!"
3,13,30,ELAINE,"Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it."
3,13,30,JERRY,Me? Why me?
3,13,30,ELAINE,'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.
3,13,30,JERRY,Y'know these things are really hard to load...
3,13,30,GEORGE,"All right, OK, I'm goin' in."
3,13,30,JERRY,We've got to talk about this
3,13,30,ELAINE,All right.
3,13,31,GEORGE,"Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful."
3,13,31,NOEL,No..
3,13,31,GEORGE,"Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel"
3,13,31,JERRY,You play a Hell of a piano.
3,13,31,ELAINE,"Yeah, I was really moved, really moved."
3,13,31,NOEL,Well didn't you hear that person laughing? I couldn't play. I was
3,13,32,ELAINE,"Well, I'm sure it wasn't at you."
3,13,32,NOEL,"Well then, what was she laughing at?"
3,13,32,JERRY,Pez?
3,13,32,NOEL,"Uh, no, No thank you. Did you see her?"
3,13,32,GEORGE,"Me, uh, uh, no, ..."
3,13,32,JERRY,Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.
3,13,32,ELAINE,Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.
3,13,32,JERRY,Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.
3,13,32,NOEL,I'll never forget that laugh for the rest of my life.
3,13,32,ELAINE,I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.
3,13,32,GEORGE,If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful
3,13,33,GEORGE,"All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat."
3,13,33,NOEL,I don't feel like it tonight.
3,13,33,JERRY,We'll be outside
3,13,33,ELAINE,Yeah
3,13,33,JERRY,"It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play?"
3,13,33,N,I just crack my knuckles.
3,13,33,GEORGE,We'll have a good time
3,13,33,N,I don't feel like it
3,13,33,GEORGE,"Ah, come on"
3,13,33,N,I said I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT!
3,13,33,GEORGE,"Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqu√©. Every thing is fine ok, uh, fine, .."
3,13,33,JERRY,You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.
3,13,33,ELAINE,What? How?
3,13,33,JERRY,A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable.
3,13,34,ELAINE,So? What happened?
3,13,34,JERRY,"What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia,"
3,13,35,ELAINE,Shut up!
3,13,35,JERRY,All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.
3,13,35,ELAINE,Whar about Kramer?
3,13,35,JERRY,He's the same!
3,13,36,JERRY,Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for
3,13,38,KRAMER,"Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?"
3,13,38,JERRY,"Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here."
3,13,38,KRAMER,Can I get in on that?
3,13,38,JERRY,What do you think? It's like a poker game?
3,13,38,KRAMER,Is Elaine going?
3,13,38,JERRY,Yeah
3,13,38,KRAMER,"Well, I knew him as well as she did."
3,13,38,JERRY,"Yeah, but John invited her."
3,13,38,KRAMER,"So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?"
3,13,38,JERRY,"No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening."
3,13,39,GEORGE,It's George
3,13,39,JERRY,Stop smelling your arm.
3,13,39,KRAMER,You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just
3,13,40,JERRY,"Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, ""That's not a bad idea."""
3,13,40,KRAMER,Tell me about it!
3,13,40,JERRY,"Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein."
3,13,42,GEORGE,Well it's over. It's definitely over.
3,13,42,JERRY,She broke up with you?
3,13,42,GEORGE,"No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation."
3,13,43,JERRY,What was on the list?
3,13,43,GEORGE,"Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,"
3,13,43,JERRY,"Yeah, Postum is under-ratted,"
3,13,43,GEORGE,Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said
3,13,44,JERRY,What's wrong with lunch?
3,13,44,GEORGE,Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted.
3,13,45,KRAMER,I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?
3,13,45,GEORGE,I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand.
3,13,45,KRAMER,Break up with her
3,13,45,GEORGE,What?
3,13,45,KRAMER,You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.
3,13,45,JERRY,A preemptive breakup.
3,13,45,GEORGE,A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose.
3,13,47,GEORGE,"So, I am have to going to break up with you."
3,13,47,NOEL,You're breaking up with me?
3,13,47,GEORGE,

3,13,47,GEORGE,"Well, live and learn."
3,13,47,NOEL,I don't understand. You're breaking up with me. Didn't we have fun doing the crossword puzzles?

3,13,47,GEORGE,"Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid."
3,13,47,NOEL,"I thought,..."
3,13,47,GEORGE,"Now, stop it ..."
3,13,47,NOEL,"What do you want, I can make you happy."
3,13,47,GEORGE,When you're playing the piano do you think about me?

3,13,47,KRAMER,You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach?
3,13,49,STEVE,That is the dumbest idea I have ever heard.
3,13,49,KRAMER,"Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?"
3,13,49,STEVE,Do you think people are going to pay $80 a bottle to smell like dead
3,13,51,KRAMER,So you don't think it's a good idea?
3,13,51,THE INTERVENTION,I may have confused the names of some of the male interveners below)

3,13,60,ELAINE,"Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now."
3,13,60,GUY,Is it because I have a tissue in my nose?
3,13,60,ELAINE,You're getting warm.

3,13,70,JERRY,He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's
3,13,72,GEORGE,Well they're hard to load.
3,13,72,JERRY,Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control
3,13,74,GEORGE,Poor kid.
