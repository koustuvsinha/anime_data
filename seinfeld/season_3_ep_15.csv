3,15,130,ELAINE,Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody.
3,15,130,CYNTHIA,"I said to him, ""I really appreciate this, but I just got my period."""
3,15,132,ELAINE,Hi!
3,15,132,GEORGE,"Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic."

3,15,132,JERRY,Acting.
3,15,132,ELAINE,Very mature.

3,15,133,GEORGE,"Stop it, stop it."
3,15,133,JERRY,So what are these?
3,15,133,ELAINE,"Oh, we ordered some appetizers. Start eating."
3,15,135,GEORGE,"This is good. Oh, this is good."
3,15,11,GEORGE,Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet
3,15,12,JERRY,"Oh, yes you will."
3,15,12,GEORGE,"No, I won't."
3,15,12,JERRY,"Yeah, maybe you won't."
3,15,12,GEORGE,"I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like."
3,15,12,JERRY,Are my nostrils getting bigger?
3,15,12,GEORGE,No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and
3,15,141,THE END,
3,15,19,CYNTHIA,"There's just no men out there, you know?"
3,15,19,ELAINE,I know.
3,15,19,CYNTHIA,I mean the problem is that the good ones know they're good. And they
3,15,21,ELAINE,I hate the good ones.
3,15,21,CYNTHIA,Is Jerry one of the good ones?
3,15,21,ELAINE,"That's a good question, I think he thinks he is."
3,15,21,CYNTHIA,"Well, the mediocre ones are available, but they're so insecure about"
3,15,24,ELAINE,"You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre."
3,15,24,CYNTHIA,"No, maybe I need somebody who has nothing, somebody who just has to"
3,15,26,GEORGE,I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on
3,15,27,JERRY,"Oh, so there's still hope."
3,15,27,GEORGE,I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become
3,15,29,JERRY,"Oh, so hopelessness is the key."
3,15,29,GEORGE,It's my only hope.
3,15,30,CYNTHIA,"See, I wouldn't really mind so much, but I feel badly for my mother."
3,15,33,ELAINE,"Well, at least you're not bitter."
3,15,33,CYNTHIA,Who says I'm not bitter?
3,15,33,ELAINE,Aren't you too young to be bitter?
3,15,33,CYNTHIA,"No, you can be young and bitter, just maybe not as bitter as I'm gonna"
3,15,34,ELAINE,"Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me."
3,15,34,CYNTHIA,"Um, order me a piece of cake. I'm gonna go throw up."
3,15,35,JERRY,"Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should"
3,15,36,ELAINE,So what'd you do last night?
3,15,36,JERRY,"Went out with George, you?"
3,15,36,ELAINE,Went out with Cynthia.
3,15,36,JERRY,How was it? What'd you talk about?
3,15,36,ELAINE,"Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest."
3,15,39,JERRY,"We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't"
3,15,40,ELAINE,"I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up."
3,15,40,JERRY,George too.
3,15,41,JERRY AND ELAINE,"Yeah, right."
3,15,41,JERRY,I've never fixed anybody up.
3,15,41,ELAINE,"Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George."
3,15,41,JERRY,Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for
3,15,42,ELAINE,"I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?"
3,15,42,JERRY,Well you implied it.
3,15,42,ELAINE,I didn't say it.
3,15,42,JERRY,"Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong."
3,15,43,ELAINE,Who is he?
3,15,43,JERRY,He's George!
3,15,43,ELAINE,She's Cynthia!
3,15,43,JERRY,So what?
3,15,43,ELAINE,"What, you don't think she's beautiful?"
3,15,43,JERRY,"I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?"
3,15,43,ELAINE,You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.
3,15,43,JERRY,I went out with you.
3,15,43,ELAINE,"That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know,"
3,15,46,JERRY,Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run
3,15,49,ELAINE,He can really do that?
3,15,49,JERRY,"Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along."
3,15,49,ELAINE,"What, are you into this?"
3,15,49,JERRY,"Yeah, come on, it's a good match."
3,15,49,ELAINE,"No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how"
3,15,50,JERRY,Naturally.
3,15,50,ELAINE,"Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean"
3,15,51,JERRY,Everything.
3,15,51,ELAINE,What if it worked out?
3,15,51,JERRY,Yeah right.
3,15,52,GEORGE,Out of the question. Out of the question!
3,15,52,JERRY,Why?

3,15,54,GEORGE,"No, something's off here, you hesitated."
3,15,54,JERRY,"I'm telling you, she's good looking."

3,15,56,CYNTHIA,He's not working?! How come he's not working?
3,15,56,ELAINE,"Well, um, he, he got fired."
3,15,56,CYNTHIA,Why did he get fired?
3,15,56,ELAINE,"Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss."

3,15,56,ELAINE,"Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems"
3,15,57,CYNTHIA,Is he nuts?
3,15,57,ELAINE,"No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy."
3,15,57,CYNTHIA,What does he look like?
3,15,57,ELAINE,Pardon?

3,15,57,ELAINE,"Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short."
3,15,58,CYNTHIA,"Fat. Is that what you're saying, that he's fat?"

3,15,61,JERRY,"You know, long dark hair."
3,15,61,GEORGE,Flowing?
3,15,61,JERRY,Flowing?
3,15,61,GEORGE,"Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is"
3,15,62,JERRY,"'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?"
3,15,62,GEORGE,"Yeah, that's right."
3,15,62,JERRY,Just clarifying.
3,15,62,GEORGE,Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to
3,15,63,JERRY,Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to
3,15,64,GEORGE,I'd like to be able to get it out.
3,15,64,JERRY,I think you'll get it out.
3,15,64,GEORGE,"What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek."

3,15,67,CYNTHIA,He didn't really try to poison his boss?
3,15,67,ELAINE,"Yeah, he did."
3,15,68,GEORGE,We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty
3,15,70,JERRY,I think it's tamber.
3,15,70,GEORGE,"Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials,"
3,15,71,JERRY,I didn't notice the voice.
3,15,71,GEORGE,It's mellifluous!

3,15,74,GEORGE,That's it?
3,15,74,ELAINE,Yeah!
3,15,74,GEORGE,She didn't mention anything about the conversation?
3,15,74,ELAINE,No.
3,15,74,GEORGE,"Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great"
3,15,75,ELAINE,What?
3,15,75,JERRY,She could have mentioned the conversation.
3,15,75,GEORGE,"Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that."
3,15,76,KRAMER,Hey.
3,15,76,JERRY,Hey.
3,15,76,KRAMER,"You know my friend, Bob Sacamano?"
3,15,76,JERRY,"Oh, the guy from Jersey?"
3,15,76,KRAMER,"Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this,"
3,15,77,GEORGE,What are you gonna do with all of them?
3,15,77,KRAMER,"Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em."
3,15,77,JERRY,"No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box."
3,15,77,KRAMER,"Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag."
3,15,77,ELAINE,"Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap."
3,15,77,GEORGE,I'll take one. It's possible.
3,15,85,JERRY,"So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back"
3,15,86,ELAINE,I think they went out to dinner.
3,15,86,JERRY,"Wait, I got another call. That must be him. Hello?"
3,15,86,GEORGE,"Yeah, it's me, I just got home."
3,15,86,JERRY,"Oh, hold on. It's George, he just got home."
3,15,86,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line."
3,15,86,JERRY,"Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done."
3,15,86,ELAINE,Remember our pact. Full disclosure.
3,15,86,JERRY,"Of course. Yeah, go ahead."
3,15,86,GEORGE,"Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we"
3,15,87,JERRY,"You can tell me, I'll vault it."
3,15,87,GEORGE,It's in the vault?
3,15,87,JERRY,I'm locking the vault. What?
3,15,87,GEORGE,We had sex.
3,15,87,JERRY,"Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?"
3,15,87,GEORGE,I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.
3,15,87,JERRY,At your apartment?
3,15,87,GEORGE,Yeah.
3,15,87,JERRY,She didn't stay over?
3,15,87,GEORGE,"No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine."
3,15,89,ELAINE,Oh my god.
3,15,89,CYNTHIA,He was uncomfortable because it was our first time so he felt he would
3,15,91,ELAINE,So? How was it?
3,15,91,CYNTHIA,How good could it be? My head was on a hot plate.
3,15,91,ELAINE,"Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry."
3,15,91,CYNTHIA,"Oh wait, don't you tell him any of this."
3,15,91,ELAINE,"Yeah, ok. Hello?"
3,15,91,JERRY,"So, what did she have to say?"
3,15,91,ELAINE,What did he have to say?
3,15,91,JERRY,He said they had a good time.
3,15,91,ELAINE,Her too.
3,15,91,JERRY,"Oh, good."
3,15,91,ELAINE,Anything else?
3,15,91,JERRY,Nope. You?
3,15,91,ELAINE,Nope.
3,15,91,JERRY,You sure?
3,15,91,ELAINE,Yup. You?
3,15,91,JERRY,Yeah.
3,15,91,ELAINE,"Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control."
3,15,91,JERRY,Yeah. Okay then.
3,15,91,ELAINE,Alright. Goodnight.
3,15,91,JERRY,Goodnight.
3,15,92,GEORGE,I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with
3,15,94,JERRY,"Well, I'm gonna do something about this."
3,15,94,GEORGE,What are you gonna do?
3,15,94,JERRY,Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor
3,15,96,GEORGE,I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was
3,15,98,JERRY,I'm gonna call her.
3,15,98,GEORGE,"No, don't call her."
3,15,98,JERRY,"No, I'm calling her."
3,15,98,GEORGE,"No, Jerry, don't call."
3,15,98,JERRY,"No, forget it, I'm gonna call."
3,15,98,GEORGE,I don't want you to call.
3,15,98,JERRY,"Get away from me, I'm gonna call her."
3,15,98,GEORGE,Give me the phone!
3,15,98,JERRY,"George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?"
3,15,98,GEORGE,"Jerry, I'm gonna kill you!"
3,15,99,KRAMER,"Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!"
3,15,99,JERRY,I'll just call her when you leave!
3,15,99,GEORGE,"You can't do that, it's none of your business!"
3,15,99,JERRY,It is so my business!
3,15,99,KRAMER,Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of
3,15,100,GEORGE,But tell him to give me the--
3,15,100,KRAMER,"Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says"
3,15,102,GEORGE,No.
3,15,102,JERRY,"Yeah, but--"
3,15,102,KRAMER,"Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They"

3,15,103,KRAMER,"Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are"
3,15,105,KRAMER,"Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean,"
3,15,107,GEORGE,What?
3,15,107,KRAMER,Right.
3,15,107,GEORGE,Defective?!
3,15,107,KRAMER,Defective.
3,15,107,GEORGE,How could you give me a defective condom?!
3,15,107,KRAMER,I didn't even know they were defective.
3,15,108,KRAMER,Didn't even thin you were gonna use them.
3,15,108,GEORGE,What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!
3,15,108,JERRY,"Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if"
3,15,110,CYNTHIA,I missed my period.
3,15,110,ELAINE,Oh my god.
3,15,110,CYNTHIA,"I am very worried, I am never late."
3,15,110,ELAINE,"But he used a condom, right?"
3,15,110,CYNTHIA,"I know, but these things aren't always foolproof."
3,15,110,ELAINE,Oh no.
3,15,110,CYNTHIA,What?
3,15,110,ELAINE,Was it blue?
3,15,110,CYNTHIA,Yeah. How'd you know?
3,15,110,ELAINE,Just a hunch.
3,15,111,JERRY,Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!
3,15,112,JERRY,"Oh, hi. Soda?"
3,15,112,ELAINE,No thanks.
3,15,112,JERRY,So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She
3,15,113,ELAINE,Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's
3,15,114,JERRY,"Oh, I know her. I know her type."
3,15,114,ELAINE,Her type? What type?
3,15,114,JERRY,The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done
3,15,115,ELAINE,"You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!"
3,15,115,JERRY,"I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend."
3,15,115,ELAINE,She's not bitter!
3,15,115,JERRY,"Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!"
3,15,115,ELAINE,"Twisted? God, I did you a favor."
3,15,115,JERRY,"I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're"
3,15,116,ELAINE,Are you calling me a liar?
3,15,116,JERRY,"I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?"
3,15,116,ELAINE,Are you?
3,15,116,JERRY,Get your finger out of my face.
3,15,116,ELAINE,"You get yours out, I was here first!"
3,15,116,JERRY,I don't care.
3,15,116,ELAINE,Get it out!
3,15,118,KRAMER,"Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the"
3,15,123,ELAINE,I knew those condoms were defective!
3,15,123,JERRY,How did you know they were defective?!
3,15,124,ELAINE,Because! Because she missed her period!
3,15,124,GEORGE,She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father!
3,15,127,CYNTHIA,So he shows up. He's all out of breath. He's disheveled. And he
