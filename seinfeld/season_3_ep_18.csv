3,18,128,MAN,O'Brien? Is that him?
3,18,128,MAN #2,"Yeah, that's him."
3,18,128,MAN #3,Look there's O'Brien!
3,18,128,MAN #4,Filthy nazi bastard!
3,18,128,ALL FOUR,Let's get him!!
3,18,130,KRAMER,"O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?"
3,18,130,TIM,Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?
3,18,130,JERRY,"No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed."
3,18,130,ELAINE,It could be very confusing.
3,18,131,KRAMER,Yeah? Eva?
3,18,131,EVA,It's for me. Hello? It's O'Brien.
3,18,131,KRAMER,O'Brien? Well that's weird.
3,18,131,EVA,Who are you?
3,18,134,JODI,A limousine has just pulled up it's being surrounded by a huge group of
3,18,129,GEORGE,What do I do?! What do I do?!
3,18,129,JERRY,Get in the car! Get in the car!
3,18,145,GEORGE,I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone!
3,18,137,JODI,"They are banging on the car, trying to flip it over. The police seem"
3,18,11,GEORGE,It's all departures. I see nothing but departures. (to the woman
3,18,13,GEORGE,"Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?"
3,18,13,MAN,There's a clock over there.
3,18,13,GEORGE,Where?
3,18,13,MAN,There.
3,18,13,GEORGE,But you have a watch on.
3,18,13,MAN,It's right by the escalator.
3,18,13,GEORGE,Why don't you just look at your watch?
3,18,13,MAN,"I told you, it's right over there."
3,18,13,GEORGE,Let me see the watch.
3,18,14,MAN,"Hey! What are you, some kind of nut?!"
3,18,14,GEORGE,You know we're living in a society!
3,18,15,JERRY,George.
3,18,15,GEORGE,Jerry. Jerry.
3,18,15,JERRY,"Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?"
3,18,15,GEORGE,I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway.
3,18,16,GEORGE,"One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking,"
3,18,17,JERRY,So you have no car?
3,18,17,GEORGE,No.
3,18,17,JERRY,So what good are you?
3,18,18,JERRY,"I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while,"
3,18,19,GEORGE,How do you know?
3,18,19,JERRY,"He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him on the"
3,18,20,GEORGE,We should take his limo.
3,18,20,JERRY,"Yeah, right."
3,18,20,GEORGE,Wait a second. Think about it. He's not showing up. Wait till you
3,18,22,JERRY,He's definitely in Chicago.
3,18,22,GEORGE,Well the guy's just standing there.
3,18,22,JERRY,How would we do it?
3,18,22,GEORGE,"We just go up to him, we say, ""We're O'Brien."""
3,18,22,JERRY,Maybe he knows O'Brien?
3,18,22,GEORGE,"No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a"
3,18,23,JERRY,What if we get caught?
3,18,23,GEORGE,What's gonna happen? They can't kill us.
3,18,23,JERRY,Who's gonna be O'Brien?
3,18,23,GEORGE,I'll be O'Brien.
3,18,23,JERRY,Who am I?
3,18,23,GEORGE,You're you.
3,18,23,JERRY,Just me?
3,18,23,GEORGE,Yeah.
3,18,23,JERRY,Okay.
3,18,23,GEORGE,"What, you don't want to be you?"
3,18,23,JERRY,"Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?"
3,18,23,GEORGE,Like who?
3,18,23,JERRY,Dylan Murphy.
3,18,24,JERRY,"What, now you wanna be Dylan Murphy?"
3,18,24,GEORGE,Well I like Dylan.
3,18,24,JERRY,You could be Colin.
3,18,24,GEORGE,Colin O'Brien.
3,18,24,JERRY,I'm Dylan Murphy.
3,18,24,GEORGE,I'm Colin O'Brien.
3,18,25,GEORGE,Are we really doing this?
3,18,25,JERRY,"Come on,"
3,18,25,MAN,"Hey, do you have the time?"
3,18,25,GEORGE,Clock over there. O'Brien.
3,18,25,CHAUFFER,Yes sir.
3,18,25,GEORGE,Sorry we're late.
3,18,25,CHAUFFER,Here let me take that for you.
3,18,25,GEORGE,Oh thank you.
3,18,25,CHAUFFER,I'll get the car and I'll bring it around front.
3,18,25,GEORGE,Thank you very much. Dylan?
3,18,25,JERRY,Colin?
3,18,26,GEORGE,This is incredible! This is one of the greatest things I've ever done
3,18,27,JERRY,What for?
3,18,27,GEORGE,"I dunno, I'm in a limo. Hello ma? It's me. Guess where I am."
3,18,31,JERRY,She happy for you?
3,18,31,GEORGE,Can he hear us?
3,18,31,JERRY,No. Why?
3,18,31,GEORGE,I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.
3,18,31,JERRY,He can't hear us.
3,18,31,GEORGE,"Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick up"
3,18,32,JERRY,Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at my
3,18,33,GEORGE,"We'll ask him. My dear fellow, where are you"
3,18,34,CHAUFFER,"Madison Square Garden, of course. I have the four passes."
3,18,34,GEORGE,"Of course, the uh, the four passes. Four passes to"
3,18,155,THE END,
3,18,36,JERRY,What?
3,18,36,GEORGE,We are going to the Knick game! Michael Jordan!
3,18,36,JERRY,We're going to the Knick game!
3,18,36,GEORGE,Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?!
3,18,36,JERRY,I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!
3,18,36,GEORGE,"You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait,"
3,18,38,JERRY,Lemme call Elaine and Kramer.
3,18,38,GEORGE,"If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'"
3,18,38,JERRY,Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I
3,18,44,CHAUFFER,I know.
3,18,44,JERRY AND GEORGE,He knows?
3,18,44,GEORGE,Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?
3,18,44,JERRY,Maybe it's a shortcut.
3,18,44,GEORGE,"We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic."
3,18,44,JERRY,"'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?"
3,18,44,CHAUFFER,Pick up the other members of your party.
3,18,44,GEORGE,Right. The other members of our party. Other
3,18,46,JERRY,"It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig."
3,18,46,GEORGE,It was a good jig.
3,18,46,JERRY,"It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now?"
3,18,47,GEORGE,There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.
3,18,47,JERRY,"First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period."
3,18,47,GEORGE,Well you should have been O'Brien.
3,18,47,JERRY,I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?
3,18,47,GEORGE,"Yes, you have to be Murphy."
3,18,47,JERRY,"It makes no sense now, me being Murphy."
3,18,47,GEORGE,You're Murphy!
3,18,47,JERRY,I'm Seinfeld!
3,18,47,GEORGE,"You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car."
3,18,47,JERRY,We're doing sixty miles an hour!
3,18,47,GEORGE,"So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt."
3,18,47,JERRY,"Who are you, Mannix?"
3,18,47,GEORGE,We're slowing down. Are those the people?
3,18,47,JERRY,"Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping."
3,18,48,WOMAN,Mr. O'Brien?
3,18,48,JERRY,"No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping."
3,18,48,EVA,"Oh, well I don't want to disturb him. We're just rather"
3,18,50,JERRY,Newsletter?
3,18,50,TIM,"And of course, his great book, ""The Game""."
3,18,50,JERRY,"Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never"
3,18,51,EVA,No.
3,18,51,JERRY,Never seen a picture of him?
3,18,51,EVA,Never.
3,18,51,JERRY,Not even on the book jacket?
3,18,51,EVA,There was no picture on the book jacket.
3,18,51,JERRY,"Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up."
3,18,51,GEORGE,Hello. I'm O'Brien.
3,18,52,KRAMER,Hey!
3,18,52,ELAINE,Hey!
3,18,52,KRAMER,"What, you took a cab?"
3,18,52,ELAINE,Yeah? So?
3,18,52,KRAMER,How much do you make?
3,18,52,ELAINE,I'm not telling you.
3,18,52,KRAMER,C'mon.
3,18,52,ELAINE,No!
3,18,52,KRAMER,I'll tell you how much I make.
3,18,52,ELAINE,"I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I"
3,18,53,KRAMER,You ever seen Michael Jordan?
3,18,53,ELAINE,Just in those commercials.
3,18,53,KRAMER,Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.
3,18,53,ELAINE,What's that?
3,18,53,KRAMER,"Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me."
3,18,53,ELAINE,Huh?
3,18,53,KRAMER,Yeah.
3,18,56,JERRY,I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.
3,18,56,TIM,You think someone's been tipped off?
3,18,56,GEORGE,"So, um, you've read ""The Big Game"", have you?"
3,18,56,EVA,Yes I've read it and I've memorized it.
3,18,56,GEORGE,"Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman"
3,18,57,EVA,"Well, this is sort of embarrassing, but it's changed my life. The way you"
3,18,59,GEORGE,"Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids."
3,18,59,TIM,Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the
3,18,60,GEORGE,"Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect."
3,18,60,JERRY,He tends to exaggerate.
3,18,60,GEORGE,"Okay, I mean it's serious but--"
3,18,60,EVA,We are really looking forward to your speech tonight.
3,18,60,GEORGE,"Uh, my speech?"
3,18,60,EVA,"Yes, your secretary faxed me the copy. Would you like to look it over?"
3,18,60,JERRY,Well you might as well look it over.
3,18,61,KRAMER,"So what's going on, how did all this happen?"
3,18,61,ELAINE,Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going
3,18,62,KRAMER,Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.
3,18,62,ELAINE,He did.
3,18,62,KRAMER,Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?
3,18,62,ELAINE,I don't know.
3,18,62,KRAMER,That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?
3,18,62,ELAINE,"Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them"
3,18,63,KRAMER,O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?
3,18,64,GEORGE,...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied
3,18,66,JERRY,"You're not going to open with that, are you?"
3,18,66,EVA,What was that you said about the myth of the Holocaust?
3,18,66,GEORGE,I said so many things.
3,18,67,GEORGE,They're shooting! They're shooting!
3,18,67,TIM,"Alright, get down!"
3,18,70,GEORGE,"That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you."
3,18,70,EVA,But of course you know I would. I would do anything for you. Anything.
3,18,71,TIM,"Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. But rest assured, we're"
3,18,74,JERRY,Nice looking Lugar.
3,18,75,JODI,I'm standing in front of the Paramount adjacent to Madison Square Garden
3,18,143,EVA,Get out!!
3,18,143,ELAINE,"Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan!"
3,18,143,DAN,Elaine?
3,18,143,ELAINE,Hey!
3,18,87,KRAMER,Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry.
3,18,91,DAN,Elaine?
3,18,91,ELAINE,"Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you?"
3,18,91,DAN,Good.
3,18,91,ELAINE,"Um, oh, this is um, Kramer."
3,18,91,DAN,"Oh, Kramer?"
3,18,92,ELAINE,What's going on?
3,18,92,DAN,"Oh, we're heading down to protest this big neo-nazi rally. The head of"
3,18,93,ELAINE,"Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game."
3,18,93,DAN,"Oh, well that's where the rally is. The Paramount, right next door."
3,18,93,ELAINE,"Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you."
3,18,93,DAN,"Yeah, yeah ok. It's really gonna be something, this is the first time"
3,18,94,KRAMER,Who?
3,18,94,DAN,The head of the Aryan Union; O'Brien.
3,18,95,JERRY,What's taking him so long out there?
3,18,95,GEORGE,Didja see the way she was looking at me?
3,18,95,JERRY,"She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi!"
3,18,95,GEORGE,"I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though."
3,18,95,JERRY,"Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?"
3,18,95,GEORGE,I don't know.
3,18,95,JERRY,Let's just make a run for it.
3,18,95,GEORGE,"I can't run, I have a bad hamstring."
3,18,95,JERRY,How'd that happen?
3,18,95,GEORGE,I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real
3,18,97,JERRY,"I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your"
3,18,98,GEORGE,"For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police."
3,18,99,GEORGE,"9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah"
3,18,101,GEORGE,"--Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The"
3,18,102,TIM,We'll be ready in a minute.
3,18,102,GEORGE,"Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle"
3,18,103,TIM,"With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave."
3,18,103,GEORGE,"Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?"
3,18,103,TIM,You are.
3,18,103,GEORGE,And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular
3,18,104,TIM,You are.
3,18,104,GEORGE,Good. I think you forgot something.
3,18,104,TIM,I'm sorry.
3,18,104,GEORGE,Good. Now get out.
3,18,105,GEORGE,"Okay, what are we gonna do?"
3,18,105,JERRY,I don't know.
3,18,105,GEORGE,"Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see"
3,18,106,JERRY,Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.
3,18,107,KRAMER,"I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it."
3,18,107,ELAINE,I'm sure he was just joking around.
3,18,107,KRAMER,"Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago,"
3,18,108,ELAINE,What is it?
3,18,108,KRAMER,"Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry,"
3,18,111,ELAINE,Jerry's a nazi?!
3,18,111,KRAMER,I can't believe I didn't see it.
3,18,111,ELAINE,"Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi."
3,18,111,KRAMER,You don't think so.
3,18,111,ELAINE,"No, he's just neat."
3,18,112,TIM,You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien.
3,18,112,GEORGE,Me??
3,18,113,TIM,And you really don't look like a Murphy.
3,18,113,JERRY,I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.
3,18,113,GEORGE,He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.
3,18,113,TIM,Where are you from?
3,18,113,JERRY,Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen.
3,18,115,TIM,Sounds more like Scottish.
3,18,115,JERRY,We were right on the border.
3,18,116,KRAMER,Maybe he's with the company.
3,18,116,ELAINE,What?
3,18,116,KRAMER,The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization
3,18,117,ELAINE,What about his comedy act?
3,18,117,KRAMER,"That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's"
3,18,118,ELAINE,What about George?
3,18,118,KRAMER,"What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise."
3,18,122,ELAINE,I'll bet they were even in on it.
3,18,122,KRAMER,"Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs"
3,18,123,ELAINE,"Kramer, you're hurting me!"
3,18,124,GEORGE,Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to
3,18,125,ELAINE,Get off of me!!
3,18,126,KRAMER,O'Brien.
