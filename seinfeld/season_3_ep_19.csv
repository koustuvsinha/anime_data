3,19,2,ELAINE,"You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the"
3,19,3,JERRY,It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.
3,19,4,JERRY,Oh look at this guy.
3,19,4,ELAINE,What's goin' on?
3,19,4,JERRY,"Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask"
3,19,5,ELAINE,Did you get a thank you wave?
3,19,5,JERRY,"No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy!"
3,19,7,JERRY,Give me that wave!
3,19,7,ELAINE,"Jerry, are you free on Friday?"
3,19,7,JERRY,"Yeah, I'm free, why?"
3,19,7,ELAINE,"Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have"
3,19,8,JERRY,Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into
3,19,9,ELAINE,You gotta follow that car!
3,19,9,JERRY,What?!
3,19,9,ELAINE,You can't let him get away with that!
3,19,9,JERRY,"Elaine, the guy could be dangerous."
3,19,9,ELAINE,"What are you, yellow?"
3,19,9,JERRY,I'm not yella.
3,19,9,ELAINE,"Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella."
3,19,9,JERRY,"Wait, he stopped, he's parking."
3,19,9,ELAINE,What? What? I can't hear you. Jerry?
3,19,11,JERRY,"Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks"
3,19,17,JERRY,So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.
3,19,17,GEORGE,Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.
3,19,17,JERRY,"You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she"
3,19,19,JERRY,"He, he, he."
3,19,19,GEORGE,I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is
3,19,20,JERRY,Let's not even analyze it.
3,19,21,GEORGE,So you didn't turn her in?
3,19,21,JERRY,I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.
3,19,21,GEORGE,Gonna see her again?
3,19,21,JERRY,Friday night.
3,19,22,JERRY,Yep.
3,19,22,ELAINE,It's me!
3,19,22,JERRY,Come on up.
3,19,23,JERRY,"By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything."
3,19,23,GEORGE,"Hey, hey, hey! I dig."
3,19,24,JERRY,"Oh, you dig?"
3,19,24,GEORGE,Yes! I see enormous potential here.
3,19,24,JERRY,Why?
3,19,25,GEORGE,Because great couples always have a great story about how they met.
3,19,27,JERRY,I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.
3,19,27,GEORGE,I don't think so.
3,19,27,JERRY,"Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for"
3,19,29,JERRY,"On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date"
3,19,32,JERRY,"What am I drinking, milk?"
3,19,33,ELAINE,Hey!
3,19,33,JERRY,Hi.
3,19,34,ELAINE,Sweater.
3,19,34,JERRY,Thank you.
3,19,34,ELAINE,So? What happened?
3,19,35,JERRY,With that?
3,19,35,ELAINE,With the car!
3,19,35,JERRY,What car?
3,19,35,ELAINE,The hit and run!
3,19,35,JERRY,"Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run."
3,19,36,ELAINE,Queens?! You followed him over the bridge?
3,19,36,JERRY,Over the bridge.
3,19,37,GEORGE,"Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry."
3,19,37,JERRY,"Yeah, Queens."
3,19,37,ELAINE,So? Then what?
3,19,37,JERRY,"So he gets out of the car, I say, ""Hey buddy! I saw you hit that"
3,19,39,JERRY,"So I said to him, ""Whatever's necessary."""
3,19,40,ELAINE,I am speechless. I am without speech.
3,19,40,GEORGE,Tell her about the shoving.
3,19,40,JERRY,What?
3,19,41,ELAINE,What shoving?!
3,19,41,JERRY,"Oh, it was nothing."
3,19,41,GEORGE,No! Tell her.
3,19,42,JERRY,"Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the"
3,19,44,ELAINE,You know karate??
3,19,44,JERRY,I know a little.
3,19,44,ELAINE,"Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did he do?"
3,19,44,JERRY,He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually.
3,19,45,KRAMER,Hey!
3,19,45,ELAINE,Did you tell Kramer?
3,19,45,JERRY,"Ah, nah!"
3,19,45,KRAMER,What? What? What? Tell me.
3,19,45,ELAINE,"Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him."
3,19,46,KRAMER,Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like
3,19,48,KRAMER,They should be sent to Australia.
3,19,49,JERRY,Australia?
3,19,49,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts."
3,19,49,JERRY,But not any more.
3,19,49,KRAMER,No.
3,19,50,ELAINE,"Hey Kramer, Kramer!"
3,19,50,KRAMER,Yeah?
3,19,50,ELAINE,What happened to you right here?
3,19,50,KRAMER,I don't know!
3,19,51,KRAMER,"You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly I"
3,19,53,ELAINE,"Well, that is, that is strange."
3,19,53,KRAMER,Yep.
3,19,54,ELAINE,"Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?"
3,19,54,JERRY,"Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date."
3,19,55,ELAINE,But last night you said you were free!
3,19,55,JERRY,We just met.
3,19,56,KRAMER,Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.
3,19,56,ELAINE,"But I, I can't go alone!"
3,19,56,JERRY,Ask George to go with you.
3,19,56,ELAINE,"George, come on! I'll pay for you."
3,19,56,GEORGE,You'll pay? I'm there.
3,19,56,JERRY,Why do you even need anybody?
3,19,56,ELAINE,"Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple."
3,19,63,ROBIN,You went out with a bullfighter?
3,19,63,ELAINE,"Yes, well, an ex-bullfighter now."
3,19,63,MICHAEL,Wow.
3,19,63,ROBIN,What was his name?
3,19,63,ELAINE,"His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio."
3,19,64,GEORGE,Pass the salt please.
3,19,64,ROBIN,Where did you meet him?
3,19,64,ELAINE,"Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is"
3,19,67,GEORGE,Bread.
3,19,68,ELAINE,I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do
3,19,71,GEORGE,God bless you.
3,19,72,ROBIN,Thank you.
3,19,72,GEORGE,"I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't"
3,19,76,WOMAN,You know who's a good actor? Anthony Quinn.
3,19,76,JERRY,"Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very"
3,19,77,WOMAN,Did you ever see Zorba the Greek?
3,19,77,JERRY,Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he
3,19,79,WOMAN,Come here.
3,19,81,GEORGE,"Really, I was, I was only kidding around."
3,19,81,ROBIN,He was only joking Michael.
3,19,82,MICHAEL,You think you're so damn special because you say 'God bless you'?
3,19,82,GEORGE,"No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not"
3,19,83,ROBIN,He was only joking Michael! Sorry.
3,19,83,MICHAEL,All right! Take his side!
3,19,83,ROBIN,I am not taking his side.
3,19,83,MICHAEL,Well who's side are you taking?!
3,19,83,ROBIN,Well I'm not taking your side!
3,19,86,JERRY,Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an
3,19,92,GEORGE,I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?
3,19,92,JERRY,"The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in"
3,19,96,ELAINE,It's me.
3,19,96,JERRY,Come on up.
3,19,97,GEORGE,"Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this: Once he passes"
3,19,98,JERRY,"No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's"
3,19,99,GEORGE,"Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed"
3,19,100,JERRY,What if she's having an off night?
3,19,101,ELAINE,Hi!
3,19,103,ELAINE,Well! If it isn't mister gesuntheit!
3,19,104,GEORGE,"Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I"
3,19,106,GEORGE,"Ah, shut up."
3,19,106,ELAINE,What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid
3,19,108,JERRY,A stupid what?
3,19,109,ELAINE,Whatever.
3,19,109,JERRY,"You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze,"
3,19,112,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a"
3,19,113,GEORGE,Who?
3,19,113,ELAINE,Robin!
3,19,114,GEORGE,Why?!
3,19,114,ELAINE,"Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me."
3,19,115,JERRY,Entertainment Tonight's on.
3,19,115,GEORGE,Where's the remote phone?
3,19,115,JERRY,Bedroom.
3,19,116,ELAINE,"Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?"
3,19,119,JERRY,What's it like out?
3,19,120,ELAINE,Chilly out.
3,19,120,JERRY,Can I take a sweater?
3,19,120,ELAINE,"Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to."
3,19,120,JERRY,Scarf?
3,19,120,ELAINE,"Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off."
3,19,121,JERRY,What's the matter? What's going on?
3,19,122,KRAMER,What happened?!
3,19,122,ELAINE,What?
3,19,122,KRAMER,I think I hit my head again!
3,19,122,JERRY,What is wrong?!
3,19,123,ELAINE,"Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last"
3,19,124,KRAMER,Yeah.
3,19,125,ELAINE,That is it!
3,19,125,KRAMER,What?
3,19,126,ELAINE,"That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something"
3,19,129,KRAMER,Mary Hart!
3,19,129,GEORGE,God.
3,19,129,ELAINE,What?
3,19,129,GEORGE,"Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get"
3,19,130,JERRY,Get together?
3,19,130,GEORGE,Maybe she just wants to talk to me?
3,19,130,ELAINE,Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.
3,19,131,GEORGE,"Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and"
3,19,134,ELAINE,Are you actually considering this?
3,19,134,GEORGE,"I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!"
3,19,134,ELAINE,"Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a"
3,19,136,JERRY,Yeah.
3,19,137,KRAMER,"Hey, you know who owns that car?"
3,19,137,JERRY,What car?
3,19,137,KRAMER,The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.
3,19,137,JERRY,Yeah who?
3,19,137,KRAMER,That blond across the street. You know the one with the long
3,19,139,JERRY,"The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her."
3,19,140,ELAINE,Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.
3,19,141,KRAMER,"Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?"
3,19,142,JERRY,The blond with the blue sweatpants!
3,19,142,GEORGE,"Well, who is she?"
3,19,142,JERRY,I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to
3,19,143,GEORGE,"Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't"
3,19,145,JERRY,Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person
3,19,149,GEORGE,You can't compromise your principles!
3,19,149,JERRY,How am I going to live with myself?!
3,19,149,GEORGE,Can't live!
3,19,149,JERRY,"I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!"
3,19,149,GEORGE,This country needs more people like you!
3,19,149,JERRY,"Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick"
3,19,150,GEORGE,I believe strongly in that as you know.
3,19,150,JERRY,There should be more people like us.
3,19,150,GEORGE,That's why the world's in the shape it's in.
3,19,150,JERRY,You're telling me.
3,19,154,JERRY,"Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I"
3,19,157,BECKY,Well God bless you.
3,19,158,JERRY,Thank you very much.
3,19,160,GEORGE,Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?
3,19,160,ROBIN,"Oh no, what's wrong?"
3,19,160,GEORGE,What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!
3,19,160,ROBIN,"You didn't commit adultery, I did."
3,19,160,GEORGE,Oh yeah.
3,19,160,ROBIN,"If I didn't do it with you, I would have done it with someone else."
3,19,160,GEORGE,"Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of"
3,19,161,ROBIN,Maybe even someone who didn't say 'God bless you'.
3,19,161,GEORGE,"Well, that's a given."
3,19,161,ROBIN,"In three years with Michael, not one 'God bless you'."
3,19,161,GEORGE,Must be hell living in that house.
3,19,163,MICHAEL,"Hi, it's Michael."
3,19,163,ELAINE,"Hi, Michael!"
3,19,163,MICHAEL,Is Robin there?
3,19,163,ELAINE,"Robin? No, why?"
3,19,163,MICHAEL,"Uh, she said she was going to be with you."
3,19,163,ELAINE,"No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter"
3,19,166,MICHAEL,"If she's not with you, then where is she?"
3,19,166,ELAINE,"Well I, I don't know."
3,19,166,MICHAEL,Is she with your bald friend from the other night?!
3,19,166,ELAINE,"No, no, come on Michael!"
3,19,166,MICHAEL,He's finished! I'm going to sew his ass to his face! I'm going to
3,19,169,ELAINE,You're soo good lookin'.
3,19,171,ANGELA,"Now you listen to me, suck face! You tell anybody, anything, and I"
3,19,172,JERRY,Let me rephra-
3,19,172,ANGELA,"I'll bash your skull into a vegematic like a bad cabbage, and I'll"
3,19,174,JERRY,"Hi Elaine, this is Angela."
3,19,174,ANGELA,I'll pluck all your body hairs out with my teeth!
3,19,175,JERRY,Well I think I get the gist of it.
3,19,175,ANGELA,So you don't say anything to anybody about me hitting that car!
3,19,176,JERRY,What car?
3,19,177,ANGELA,Good. I'm glad we understand each other.
3,19,177,JERRY,It's not complicated.
3,19,178,ELAINE,Very nice meeting you!
3,19,179,ELAINE,Come on up.
3,19,180,ELAINE,"Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening!"
3,19,182,JERRY,Alright Elaine.
3,19,182,ELAINE,"No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind"
3,19,183,JERRY,It was just a couple of blocks.
3,19,184,ELAINE,"Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!"
3,19,186,GEORGE,Hey.
3,19,186,ELAINE,"Oh, did you check you machine?"
3,19,187,GEORGE,"No, why, what's happening?"
3,19,187,ELAINE,"Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was."
3,19,187,GEORGE,"Yeah, okay."
3,19,187,ELAINE,And I said I hadn't seen her.
3,19,187,GEORGE,What?!
3,19,187,ELAINE,"No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was"
3,19,190,GEORGE,He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!
3,19,190,ELAINE,He said he was going to sew your ass to your face.
3,19,190,GEORGE,What? Why couldn't you think of something?!
3,19,190,ELAINE,"Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!"
3,19,190,GEORGE,You lie! How hard is it to lie?!
3,19,191,JERRY,It's not that hard.
3,19,192,ELAINE,Well who told you to sleep with her George?!
3,19,192,GEORGE,It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got her
3,19,193,ELAINE,Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have
3,19,194,GEORGE,Oh don't-
3,19,195,JERRY,Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador?
3,19,195,GEORGE,She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.
3,19,195,JERRY,"A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what"
3,19,196,ELAINE,"Uh, Eduardo, uh, Carochio."
3,19,197,JERRY,"Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls"
3,19,201,JERRY,"Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the"
3,19,202,BECKY,"Well, I already got an estimate. It's"
3,19,202,BECKY,That's right.
3,19,202,JERRY,"Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then"
3,19,204,JERRY,"Um, who do I make it out to?"
3,19,204,BECKY,Becky Gelke. G-E-L-K-E.
3,19,204,JERRY,"So, what are you doing this weekend?"
3,19,205,BECKY,"You have got some nerve! You smash up my car, you don't admit it, and"
3,19,206,JERRY,I didn't do it!
3,19,206,BECKY,Yeah righ-
3,19,207,JERRY,You are soo good lookin'.
3,19,208,BECKY,Thank you.
3,19,210,GEORGE,"Jerry, let's go! You ready?"
3,19,211,JERRY,You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three
3,19,212,GEORGE,"Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the"
3,19,213,JERRY,Alright!
3,19,214,GEORGE,Come on let's get out of here.
3,19,215,KRAMER,How could you?
3,19,215,JERRY,What?!
3,19,215,KRAMER,Man! I never thought you were capable of this!
3,19,215,JERRY,What did I do?
3,19,215,KRAMER,"I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit and"
3,19,216,KRAMER,I don't even want to look at you anymore! All these years of
3,19,218,JERRY,I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!
3,19,218,KRAMER,"Now you're not going to lie to me, are you?"
3,19,219,JERRY,"No, never."
3,19,219,KRAMER,Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a
3,19,220,JERRY,You got a date with Becky Gelke?!
3,19,220,KRAMER,"Yeah, going out with her Saturday night."
3,19,220,GEORGE,"Jerry, can we get out of here?!"
3,19,220,KRAMER,"As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had"
3,19,221,JERRY,"Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can."
3,19,222,THE END,
