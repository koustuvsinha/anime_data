3,20,1,NINA,"Kramer, would you hold still? I can't do this if you keep"
3,20,2,KRAMER,You sure you don't want me to take my clothes off? I'll do it!
3,20,2,NINA,"No, that's the last thing in the world I want you to do."
3,20,2,KRAMER,"Well, why don't you take your clothes off?"
3,20,2,NINA,I don't know... I don't think Jerry would like that.
3,20,2,KRAMER,"Well, it'd be our little secret."
3,20,3,GEORGE,Button fly!
3,20,5,JERRY,I like the button fly.
3,20,5,GEORGE,What?
3,20,5,JERRY,That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking
3,20,7,GEORGE,Nothing.
3,20,7,JERRY,"I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her"
3,20,8,GEORGE,I don't get art.
3,20,8,JERRY,There's nothing to get.
3,20,8,GEORGE,"Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have"
3,20,9,JERRY,She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer
3,20,10,GEORGE,What for?
3,20,10,JERRY,She sees something in him.
3,20,10,GEORGE,"So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall."
3,20,11,KRAMER,"Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. Or, really,"
3,20,12,NINA,Tell me about Elaine.
3,20,12,KRAMER,"She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd."
3,20,12,NINA,"But, they're still friends."
3,20,12,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, they're like this ."
3,20,12,NINA,Don't you think that's strange?
3,20,12,KRAMER,"Why, what's the difference?"
3,20,12,NINA,"Well, are you still friends with any of your ex-girlfriends?"
3,20,12,KRAMER,"Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships."
3,20,13,GEORGE,"You know, I'm a little nervous."
3,20,13,JERRY,Why?
3,20,13,GEORGE,"Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like I'm"
3,20,14,JERRY,I don't know how long this is gonna last.
3,20,14,GEORGE,Really? I thought you liked her.
3,20,14,JERRY,I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having
3,20,15,GEORGE,"You know, it's a miracle you're not married. Hey, I'm not"
3,20,17,JERRY,"Hi, Nina. This is my friend George."
3,20,17,NINA,"How nice to meet you, I've heard a lot about you."
3,20,17,JERRY,"Hey, look at this guy!"
3,20,17,KRAMER,Yeah!
3,20,17,JERRY,I brought George up to see some of your paintings.
3,20,17,NINA,"Oh, are you interested?"
3,20,17,GEORGE,"Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested."
3,20,17,KRAMER,"George, you gonna buy a painting?"
3,20,17,GEORGE,"Yeah, sure."
3,20,17,NINA,Are you an art-lover?
3,20,17,GEORGE,I am an art-adorer! I adore art.
3,20,17,NINA,"Great! Well, take a look around. Pick out something you like."
3,20,19,JERRY,May I?
3,20,19,NINA,"Get outta here! Here, play with this. (hands"
3,20,20,JERRY,What's this?
3,20,20,NINA,My father gave me four tickets to the Yankee game for Saturday
3,20,21,JERRY,"Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going"
3,20,22,NINA,"Oh, well. I'm not gonna go without you. Do you guys want 'em?"
3,20,22,KRAMER,Yeah.
3,20,22,JERRY,"They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!"
3,20,22,GEORGE,"Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?"
3,20,22,NINA,"Oh, my father's the Yankees accountant... it's the owner's box."
3,20,22,GEORGE,"All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the dugout!"
3,20,22,NINA,"(gesturing towards a small, ugly painting George was apparently look-"
3,20,25,GEORGE,Look at where we are! He's not
3,20,27,USHER,"No, no, these are your seats."
3,20,27,GEORGE,She said first row! Right behind the dugout!
3,20,27,ELAINE,"Well, it's the second row. It's just as good."
3,20,27,GEORGE,I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up
3,20,28,ELAINE,Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than
3,20,29,GEORGE,"Oh, there's better, right"
3,20,30,KRAMER,"Right. Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? (Kramer"
3,20,31,ELAINE,I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.
3,20,31,GEORGE,You're supposed to do that?
3,20,31,ELAINE,Yeah. What makes you think anyone would want to
3,20,32,GEORGE,I'd rather go to a hanging.
3,20,32,ELAINE,"Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father"
3,20,33,KRAMER,
3,20,34,MAN,George?
3,20,34,GEORGE,Yeah?
3,20,34,MAN,"Hi. I'm Leonard West, Nina's father."
3,20,34,GEORGE,"Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--"
3,20,34,ELAINE,Hi!
3,20,34,KRAMER,
3,20,34,GEORGE,--and this is Kramer.
3,20,34,KRAMER,"Oh, hey."
3,20,35,WEST,So how are the seats?
3,20,35,GEORGE,Okay.
3,20,35,ELAINE,"Great, great."
3,20,35,KRAMER,Yeah.
3,20,35,WEST,"George, I heard you bought one of Nina's paintings."
3,20,35,GEORGE,"Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs."
3,20,36,WEST,"Well, if you have a lot of money."
3,20,37,WEST,"Well, enjoy the game. I think you"
3,20,38,ELAINE,Yeah. I better!
3,20,38,WEST,"No, no, no. Seriously. You're in the owner's box, and I don't"
3,20,39,ELAINE,You're not serious.
3,20,39,WEST,"Yes, yes, yes, I am!"
3,20,39,ELAINE,"Well, did he say that?"
3,20,39,WEST,"No, no, but he gave me the seats. I don't think he'd like it if"
3,20,40,ELAINE,Well maybe you should ask him!
3,20,40,WEST,I don't have to ask him! Now are you gonna take the hat off or
3,20,41,ELAINE,"No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This"
3,20,42,GEORGE,Just take the cap off.
3,20,42,ELAINE,"George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!"
3,20,42,WEST,"Look. Either you take the cap off, or you'll have to leave."
3,20,42,ELAINE,"Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off."
3,20,42,GEORGE,Just take the cap off!
3,20,42,ELAINE,No!
3,20,45,KRAMER,Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!
3,20,45,GEORGE,Do you want us to go with you?
3,20,45,KRAMER,"I'll go get your hat, George."
3,20,45,ELAINE,Stay!
3,20,45,GEORGE,"Okay, we'll go!"
3,20,47,IS,"the ball knocks him squarely in the head, he falls off the dugout onto"
3,20,49,ELAINE,...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over
3,20,50,JERRY,Is he okay?
3,20,50,ELAINE,"Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you"
3,20,51,JERRY,This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you
3,20,52,ELAINE,I know! Can you imagine that?
3,20,53,JERRY,How you feeling?
3,20,53,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. Hey,"
3,20,55,ELAINE,Wha- a picture?
3,20,55,KRAMER,A picture.
3,20,55,KRAMER,Uh-huh.
3,20,56,ELAINE,I cannot believe this!
3,20,56,JERRY,There's George!
3,20,56,KRAMER,"Yup, yup!"
3,20,56,ELAINE,Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father!
3,20,59,ELAINE,"Hi, Mr. Lippman."
3,20,59,LIPPMAN,How's your father?
3,20,59,ELAINE,"My, my father?"
3,20,59,LIPPMAN,"Yeah. You, you went to see him, right?"
3,20,59,ELAINE,Yeah.
3,20,59,LIPPMAN,Uh-huh.
3,20,59,ELAINE,I went to visit him.
3,20,59,LIPPMAN,"Uh-huh. So, what was wrong with him?"
3,20,59,ELAINE,"Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia..."
3,20,59,LIPPMAN,But--but he's feeling better now?
3,20,59,ELAINE,"Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have"
3,20,60,LIPPMAN,Boo-eed.
3,20,60,ELAINE,What--what did I say?
3,20,60,LIPPMAN,"You said ""boyed."""
3,20,60,ELAINE,I did?
3,20,60,LIPPMAN,Yeah.
3,20,63,LIPPMAN,"Well, I got a plane to catch."
3,20,63,ELAINE,Oh! Where are you going?
3,20,63,LIPPMAN,Going to Houston. It's a publisher's convention. Can I have
3,20,64,ELAINE,Ah. ...Yeah.
3,20,64,LIPPMAN,I've been saving it for the plane. I never miss the Sunday sports
3,20,65,ELAINE,"There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the"
3,20,66,LIPPMAN,"Right, right. (starts to take the paper from Elaine's hand; Elaine"
3,20,67,ELAINE,"Wha-- oh! Oh, god! That is the THIRD"
3,20,69,LIPPMAN,Gotta go.
3,20,69,ELAINE,"Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty!"
3,20,71,MRS.ARM,"I sense great vulcrability. A land child crying out for love, an"
3,20,72,MR. ARM,I see a parasite.
3,20,72,MRS.ARM,"A sexually-depraved miscrient, who is seeking to gratify only his"
3,20,74,NINA,She was a guest of my father's. She should've taken the cap off.
3,20,74,JERRY,It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap
3,20,76,MRS.ARM,"He is struggled, he is man-struggled. He lifts my spirit!"
3,20,76,MR. ARM,"He is a loathsome, offensive brute, yet I can't look away."
3,20,77,JERRY,"Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we"
3,20,78,NINA,"Oh, well, you wouldn't want that because you always have to"
3,20,79,JERRY,"Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!"
3,20,79,NINA,"Hey -- why don't you just go then! And -- oh, give this to George."
3,20,81,MRS.ARM,He transcends time and space.
3,20,81,MR. ARM,He sickens me.
3,20,81,MRS.ARM,I love it.
3,20,81,MR. ARM,Me too.
3,20,82,GEORGE,Five-hundred dollars?! What?
3,20,82,JERRY,That's what she told me!
3,20,82,GEORGE,I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!
3,20,82,JERRY,That's what it costs!
3,20,82,GEORGE,Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!
3,20,82,JERRY,I wasn't thinking! I don't know.
3,20,82,GEORGE,You weren't thinking.
3,20,82,JERRY,"Well, she framed it and everything."
3,20,82,GEORGE,"Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this!"
3,20,84,JERRY,Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some-
3,20,85,GEORGE,"I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a"
3,20,86,KRAMER,This was in front of your
3,20,87,GEORGE,"Hey, Kramer."
3,20,87,KRAMER,"Hi, Mike."
3,20,87,JERRY,"Wow, a letter from Nina!"
3,20,87,KRAMER,"Whoa, man! That is the ugliest thing I've ever"
3,20,88,JERRY,Oh my god!
3,20,88,GEORGE,What?
3,20,88,JERRY,"This is amazing, you can't believe this!"
3,20,88,GEORGE,What's it say?
3,20,88,JERRY,"Listen to this: ""I don't know what you expect to find out there,"
3,20,94,KRAMER,She's deep.
3,20,94,JERRY,"""...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not"
3,20,98,KRAMER,"You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!"
3,20,98,JERRY,No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about
3,20,99,KRAMER,Yeah! Get in there and give her a
3,20,100,JERRY,Should I?
3,20,100,KRAMER,
3,20,101,JERRY,
3,20,103,JERRY,
3,20,104,GEORGE,It's George.
3,20,104,JERRY,"Come on up. Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love"
3,20,105,NINA,What's the appeal of the posse?
3,20,105,JERRY,The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away
3,20,108,NINA,"Hello, George."
3,20,108,GEORGE,"Hey, Nina! I owe you some money, don't I?"
3,20,108,NINA,"Well, I really love that piece."
3,20,108,GEORGE,"Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact,"
3,20,111,NINA,"No, no no no, George! A deal's a deal. I want you to have it!"
3,20,111,GEORGE,This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should
3,20,112,NINA,"Honestly, George, the money's not important."
3,20,112,GEORGE,Who said anything about money?
3,20,112,JERRY,Yeah?
3,20,112,ELAINE,It's Elaine.
3,20,112,JERRY,Come on up.
3,20,112,NINA,Elaine?
3,20,112,JERRY,...Yeah.
3,20,112,NINA,"This person does not believe in telephones, does she?"
3,20,112,JERRY,She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. (pointing
3,20,113,GEORGE,I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.
3,20,113,JERRY,Yeah.
3,20,113,GEORGE,How 'bout Kramer.
3,20,113,JERRY,
3,20,113,NINA,"Well, I was leaving anyway, so, uh, we're on for tomorrow?"
3,20,113,JERRY,Yeah.
3,20,113,NINA,Okay.
3,20,113,JERRY,Okay!
3,20,113,NINA,Bye.
3,20,113,ELAINE,Hello!
3,20,114,ELAINE,"Chatty gal. Lippman's coming back tomorrow, I'll"
3,20,115,JERRY,"If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!"
3,20,115,ELAINE,"No, he wants to torture me."
3,20,117,ELAINE,Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when you're the
3,20,119,JERRY,I'm a great clicker!
3,20,120,ELAINE,You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never
3,20,122,JERRY,Let go!
3,20,122,ELAINE,"No, come on! I want it, Jerry!"
3,20,122,JERRY,"Let go, Elaine!"
3,20,122,ELAINE,Well at least let George do it!
3,20,122,JERRY,"Oh, George can't click!"
3,20,122,GEORGE,Give it! Give it! (he finally
3,20,125,JERRY,"Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that. (they watch it a little"
3,20,126,ELAINE,"It's Chapter 2, it's Neil Simon."
3,20,126,JERRY,Wait a second... wait a second!! (he watches the TV
3,20,127,ELAINE,What letter?
3,20,127,JERRY,"This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!"
3,20,129,JERRY,"""...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness"
3,20,130,GEORGE,This is incredible!
3,20,130,JERRY,I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She cop-
3,20,131,GEORGE,Maybe I won't send her that check.
3,20,131,ELAINE,"You know, it's not really that terrible."
3,20,131,JERRY,What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself!
3,20,136,LIPPMAN,"...yeah, yeah. But she wouldn't take the cap off?"
3,20,145,ELAINE,"Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore."
3,20,145,LIPPMAN,"Yeah, but you're an Oriole fan, right?"
3,20,145,ELAINE,"Well, uh, fan. My father--"
3,20,145,LIPPMAN,"Anyway, she refused to take the cap off; caused a whole big scene!"
3,20,145,ELAINE,Really?
3,20,145,LIPPMAN,Yeah.
3,20,145,ELAINE,So... impudent.
3,20,145,LIPPMAN,"Yeah, so Lenny gave me the tickets for tomorrow night. I'm inviting"
3,20,146,ELAINE,"Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--"
3,20,146,LIPPMAN,"Well, break 'em. You missed the bris, I want you at the game."
3,20,146,ELAINE,Okay.
3,20,146,LIPPMAN,Good. Oh--and Elaine. You know the Baltimore
3,20,148,ELAINE,That will be fun.
3,20,150,JERRY,How's it coming?
3,20,150,NINA,"Good, good."
3,20,150,JERRY,Seen any good movies lately?
3,20,150,NINA,No... not really. You?
3,20,150,JERRY,"No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil"
3,20,151,NINA,"Neil Simon? Uh, some of his stuff."
3,20,151,JERRY,"I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh..."
3,20,152,NINA,I don't know... maybe.
3,20,152,JERRY,"I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night."
3,20,155,MR. ARM,"Well, we've made our decision. We want ""The Kramer."""
3,20,157,GEORGE,Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000?
3,20,157,JERRY,"Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!"
3,20,157,GEORGE,So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?
3,20,157,JERRY,"Yeah. And by the way, can"
3,20,158,GEORGE,"Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right"
3,20,160,TVVOICE,"Uh, there's seems to be a lot of trouble in the area just behind the"
3,20,161,GEORGE,"Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day."
3,20,161,TVVOICE,"Well, we're not going to show it, we don't want to encourage that kind"
3,20,168,KRAMER,"...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a"
3,20,169,MRS.ARM,More potatoes?
3,20,169,KRAMER,"Yeah, sure. Please."
3,20,169,MR. ARM,"Yes, yes. Go on. You hopped a steamship to Sweden?"
3,20,169,KRAMER,"Yeah. And, it was a big one."
3,20,169,THE END,
