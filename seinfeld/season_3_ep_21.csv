3,21,8,KRAMER,"Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen"
3,21,9,JERRY,What are you talking about?
3,21,9,KRAMER,"Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right?"
3,21,9,JERRY,Yeah.
3,21,9,KRAMER,"Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone."
3,21,9,JERRY,"Oh yeah, I know."
3,21,9,KRAMER,"Well, where is it?"
3,21,9,JERRY,What's the difference?
3,21,9,KRAMER,"Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious."
3,21,9,JERRY,"You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?"
3,21,9,KRAMER,What happened to the car?
3,21,9,JERRY,"If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?"
3,21,9,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, it'll kill me."
3,21,9,JERRY,"You have to know, you must know."
3,21,9,KRAMER,I must know.
3,21,9,JERRY,"Well, I'm not telling you."
3,21,9,KRAMER,"Oh, come on."
3,21,9,JERRY,Nope. I don't think so.
3,21,9,KRAMER,"Well, please?"
3,21,9,JERRY,"Not today, pal."
3,21,9,KRAMER,"Okay, I beg you."
3,21,9,JERRY,Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put
3,21,10,KRAMER,"Okay, please! Please tell me!"
3,21,10,JERRY,"Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work."
3,21,10,KRAMER,"Okay, okay, what is it? Come on."
3,21,10,JERRY,I loaned the car to George.
3,21,10,KRAMER,"Ah, George, alright. Well, what for?"
3,21,10,JERRY,"George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!"
3,21,10,KRAMER,Alright.
3,21,10,JERRY,Huh?
3,21,10,KRAMER,"Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?"
3,21,10,JERRY,Will you stop it already?!
3,21,10,KRAMER,"You know, why didn't they ask me to go?"
3,21,10,JERRY,I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!
3,21,10,KRAMER,"What, they don't like me?"
3,21,10,JERRY,
3,21,10,KRAMER,"If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah."
3,21,11,GEORGE,I really think it looks good.
3,21,11,ELAINE,"Ten bucks, how can you go wrong?"
3,21,11,GEORGE,All bald people look good in hats.
3,21,11,ELAINE,"You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore"
3,21,12,GEORGE,What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.
3,21,12,ELAINE,"Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?"
3,21,12,GEORGE,"No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that"
3,21,14,ELAINE,Are you sure you like these sunglasses?
3,21,17,KRAMER,Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm
3,21,18,JERRY,Why not?
3,21,18,KRAMER,"Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got"
3,21,19,JERRY,Yep. Starts in thirty-five minutes.
3,21,20,KRAMER,"Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?"
3,21,20,JERRY,"No, I like Mike."
3,21,20,KRAMER,"Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great"
3,21,21,JERRY,Oh yeah? What did you talk about?
3,21,21,KRAMER,Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty
3,21,22,JERRY,Oh yeah? What did he say?
3,21,22,KRAMER,"You have to know everything, don't you?"
3,21,22,JERRY,"No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?"
3,21,22,KRAMER,Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?
3,21,22,JERRY,"Kramer, just tell me what the guy said."
3,21,22,KRAMER,Beg me.
3,21,22,JERRY,"Please, don't make me beg."
3,21,22,KRAMER,"No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just"
3,21,23,JERRY,"Kramer, please tell me what the guy said."
3,21,23,KRAMER,"No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No,"
3,21,24,JERRY,Kramer!
3,21,24,KRAMER,"Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in"
3,21,25,JERRY,Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.
3,21,25,KRAMER,Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.
3,21,25,JERRY,"I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the"
3,21,26,KRAMER,He thinks you're a phony.
3,21,26,JERRY,He what?
3,21,26,KRAMER,"I told you, he thinks you're a phony."
3,21,26,JERRY,A phony? He called me a phony?
3,21,26,KRAMER,A big phone. A big one.
3,21,26,JERRY,Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!
3,21,26,KRAMER,You begged me.
3,21,28,GEORGE,Do you hear that?
3,21,28,ELAINE,Of course I hear that.
3,21,28,GEORGE,You had to move the mirror?
3,21,28,ELAINE,I wanted to check out my sunglasses.
3,21,28,GEORGE,"I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my"
3,21,29,ELAINE,"Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George."
3,21,29,GEORGE,I can't drive?
3,21,29,ELAINE,Yeah.
3,21,29,GEORGE,"Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have"
3,21,31,ELAINE,"No, I really don't."
3,21,31,GEORGE,And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.
3,21,31,ELAINE,I'm sure you could.
3,21,31,GEORGE,What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?
3,21,31,ELAINE,I don't know.
3,21,31,GEORGE,"Alright, start looking for spaces."
3,21,31,ELAINE,"Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a"
3,21,32,GEORGE,"Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front"
3,21,33,ELAINE,"Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend"
3,21,34,GEORGE,I can't park in a garage.
3,21,34,ELAINE,Why?
3,21,34,GEORGE,"I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking,"
3,21,36,ELAINE,I'll pay for it.
3,21,36,GEORGE,You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's
3,21,39,ELAINE,"Oh George, there's a space right there!"
3,21,39,GEORGE,"Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream"
3,21,41,ELAINE,You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.
3,21,42,GEORGE,"Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into"
3,21,46,ELAINE,Will you just park it already?
3,21,46,GEORGE,"There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's"
3,21,48,ELAINE,"George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking"
3,21,49,GEORGE,"No no no, he's not getting away with this."
3,21,49,ELAINE,George?
3,21,50,GEORGE,"Hey, what are you doing?"
3,21,50,MIKE,I think I'm parking my car.
3,21,50,GEORGE,"You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that."
3,21,50,MIKE,"I'm not sneaking. I didn't even know you were parking, you were just"
3,21,51,GEORGE,"Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head"
3,21,52,MIKE,"Well that's the way I park. Anyway, you didn't start backing in until I"
3,21,53,GEORGE,I was in the middle of a conversation.
3,21,53,MIKE,"Hey, buddy, what can I tell you?"
3,21,53,GEORGE,The point is I was here first.
3,21,53,MIKE,I was closer to this space than you were.
3,21,53,GEORGE,But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!
3,21,53,MIKE,I can if I have room!
3,21,53,GEORGE,Are you gonna move the car?
3,21,53,MIKE,"No, I'm not gonna move the car."
3,21,53,GEORGE,Jerk!
3,21,53,MIKE,"Oh, you're not?"
3,21,53,GEORGE,Do you believe this guy?
3,21,53,ELAINE,"Come on, we'll put it in a garage."
3,21,53,GEORGE,"I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space."
3,21,53,ELAINE,"What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh."
3,21,54,GEORGE,Are you coming back down?
3,21,54,ELAINE,"Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom."
3,21,54,GEORGE,"Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what"
3,21,55,ELAINE,"Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo."
3,21,55,GEORGE,"Oh, come on, you're good at this."
3,21,55,ELAINE,What am I gonna say?
3,21,55,GEORGE,"I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something."
3,21,57,ELAINE,"Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?"
3,21,57,JERRY,"Yeah, under the counter. What happened?"
3,21,57,ELAINE,"Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the"
3,21,59,JERRY,Tell me what happened.
3,21,68,JERRY,He is?
3,21,68,ELAINE,"Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air."
3,21,68,JERRY,A gun?!
3,21,68,ELAINE,I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the
3,21,69,JERRY,"My god, are you okay?"
3,21,69,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now"
3,21,70,JERRY,"Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing."
3,21,70,ELAINE,Exactly.
3,21,70,JERRY,Where's George now?
3,21,70,ELAINE,"Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy"
3,21,71,JERRY,What are you talking about?
3,21,71,ELAINE,"Look out the window, you'll see."
3,21,71,JERRY,Hey Georgie!
3,21,71,GEORGE,Hey!
3,21,71,JERRY,Are you okay?
3,21,71,GEORGE,"Yeah, I'm fine."
3,21,71,JERRY,"Crazy kids, huh?"
3,21,71,GEORGE,What?
3,21,71,ELAINE,Ow!! It's my cuticle.
3,21,71,MIKE,Is that Jerry? Jerry?!
3,21,71,JERRY,"Oh, hey Mike."
3,21,72,MIKE,"Yeah, I know Jerry."
3,21,72,GEORGE,How do you know him?
3,21,72,MIKE,What's the difference?
3,21,72,GEORGE,"Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you."
3,21,72,MIKE,"Well, bully for you. Hey, Jerry! You know your friend here's a real"
3,21,73,JERRY,I'm coming down.
3,21,73,MIKE,"Hey, will you tell Kramer I'm outside?"
3,21,75,ELAINE,Hi.
3,21,75,KRAMER,Hello.
3,21,75,JERRY,"Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you."
3,21,75,KRAMER,"Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!"
3,21,75,GEORGE,And you're watching the fight at Jerry's?
3,21,75,MIKE,Yeah.
3,21,75,GEORGE,Oh great.
3,21,75,ELAINE,You know that guy downstairs?
3,21,75,JERRY,"Yeah, he's a real phony."
3,21,75,KRAMER,What's going on?!
3,21,75,MIKE,"Hey, will you come on down? This guy's in my space!"
3,21,75,GEORGE,It's my space!
3,21,75,KRAMER,I'll be down in a minute.
3,21,75,ELAINE,Are you going down?
3,21,75,KRAMER,Yeah.
3,21,75,ELAINE,Is anything wrong?
3,21,75,KRAMER,Why should anything be wrong?
3,21,75,ELAINE,Be down in a minute.
3,21,76,MIKE,"Hey pal, you're not getting that space. I mean, I'll sleep in my car if"
3,21,77,GEORGE,I'll die out here.
3,21,78,BYSTANDER #1,"He was down there. Once he passed his front bumper, it's no"
3,21,79,BYSTANDER #2,"No, it doesn't matter. He was-"
3,21,79,MIKE,Hey! Jerry! Long time no see!
3,21,79,JERRY,Hi Mike. Indiana.
3,21,79,MIKE,Hey Krame! You know this guy?
3,21,79,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, I know him."
3,21,79,MIKE,You're looking tremendous. What are you on some kind of
3,21,80,JERRY,"Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much"
3,21,82,MIKE,Ha ha ha ha!!! That's killer! Killer!
3,21,83,GEORGE,"Oh, come on."
3,21,83,MIKE,Hey! Your friend here has some real problems.
3,21,83,GEORGE,"Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my"
3,21,84,MIKE,"Hey, just 'cause I went in front first doesn't mean I'm sneaking in."
3,21,84,GEORGE,You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you
3,21,85,MIKE,I only went in front first 'cause I could make it in front first and if
3,21,86,GEORGE,You've got a prayer.
3,21,86,KRAMER,I go in front first all the time.
3,21,86,JERRY,"Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job."
3,21,87,GEORGE,Did you talk to him?
3,21,87,ELAINE,"Yeah, it's all taken care of."
3,21,87,GEORGE,You told him? What did you tell him?
3,21,87,ELAINE,"I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have"
3,21,88,GEORGE,"I don't believe it, what did you say?"
3,21,88,ELAINE,I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and
3,21,89,GEORGE,A pack of teenagers?
3,21,89,ELAINE,"Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved"
3,21,90,GEORGE,"You are a genius, it's as simple as that."
3,21,90,ELAINE,"What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it"
3,21,92,KRAMER,"By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market."
3,21,92,ELAINE,What?
3,21,92,KRAMER,"Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it."
3,21,92,GEORGE,Oh great.
3,21,92,JERRY,I didn't know.
3,21,92,ELAINE,"Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny."
3,21,92,GEORGE,Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.
3,21,92,MIKE,A flea market? You went to a flea market??
3,21,92,GEORGE,"Hey, who's talking to you?"
3,21,92,ELAINE,We just didn't think of you.
3,21,92,KRAMER,"You said it, sister."
3,21,92,GEORGE,What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know
3,21,94,GEORGE,"Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move."
3,21,94,JERRY,I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!
3,21,94,GEORGE,"Judgement, Jerry, judgement! You exercised no judgement."
3,21,94,JERRY,You're right. My fault.
3,21,94,ELAINE,"Kramer? I'm so sorry, really."
3,21,94,GEORGE,"Yeah, I'm sorry."
3,21,94,KRAMER,"I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry."
3,21,94,GEORGE,"What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that"
3,21,95,JERRY,It was a so-so sorry.
3,21,96,TRUCK DRIVER,"Hey! Move this car, I gotta get through!"
3,21,96,GEORGE,You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.
3,21,96,MIKE,And like you're not gonna just back it in if I do that?
3,21,96,TRUCK DRIVER,Well somebody better move something soon! I got a truck full of
3,21,98,ELAINE,"You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through,"
3,21,100,JERRY,"Wild pack of teenagers, huh?"
3,21,100,GEORGE,Yeah.
3,21,100,JERRY,"Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize."
3,21,100,ELAINE,"Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?"
3,21,100,GEORGE,Uh huh.
3,21,100,JERRY,"Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,"
3,21,100,GEORGE,"Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what"
3,21,101,ELAINE,Right.
3,21,101,GEORGE,I learned a lot about myself.
3,21,101,JERRY,What did you do to my car?!
3,21,101,GEORGE,"I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated."
3,21,101,ELAINE,"Oh, like you've ever been bobulated."
3,21,101,JERRY,I thought you said you were a good driver!
3,21,101,GEORGE,"No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker."
3,21,101,JERRY,I think you said driver.
3,21,101,GEORGE,"Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker."
3,21,101,MIKE,Will you move it up a little bit?
3,21,101,GEORGE,"No no no, that's in the right position."
3,21,101,MIKE,"No no, I was further in."
3,21,101,GEORGE,"No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine."
3,21,101,MIKE,Do you mind?
3,21,101,GEORGE,Do you?
3,21,101,SID,"Hey, somebody better move these cars, you're making a commotion."
3,21,101,JERRY,Hey Sid.
3,21,101,MIKE,Who are you?
3,21,101,SID,Never mind who I am. I know who I am. Do you know who you are? (to
3,21,103,GEORGE,"Sid, it's completely his fault."
3,21,103,MIKE,"Oh, right."
3,21,103,SID,Why don't you start taking the bus?
3,21,103,JERRY,"Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The"
3,21,104,GEORGE,Don't do it!
3,21,104,JERRY,"What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?"
3,21,104,GEORGE,"Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space."
3,21,104,ELAINE,Why don't you just flip a coin already?
3,21,104,GEORGE,"No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that"
3,21,108,ELAINE,"You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about"
3,21,109,GEORGE,So you're against me now?
3,21,111,ANGRY MAN,"He could have pulled up to the car and backed in, but he chose to go"
3,21,112,MATTHEW,"No he couldn't, because the other car was already backing in."
3,21,112,ANGRY MAN,No he wasn't.
3,21,112,MATTHEW,All that matters is who was there first.
3,21,112,ANGRY MAN,"Ahh, you're not even old enough to drive, you little puke."
3,21,112,MATTHEW,You just spit on me!
3,21,112,ANGRY MAN,Don't you raise your voice to me!
3,21,112,MATTHEW,You're not my father.
3,21,112,JERRY,Hey Matthew.
3,21,112,MATTHEW,Hi Jerry. This guy's really a jerk.
3,21,112,JERRY,How ya doing?
3,21,112,MATTHEW,Okay.
3,21,112,JERRY,"Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store."
3,21,112,MATTHEW,What?!
3,21,112,JERRY,"Oh no, nothing."
3,21,112,MATTHEW,What's happened to daddy? He's going out of business?
3,21,112,JERRY,"No, no, no, no."
3,21,112,MATTHEW,We're not going to have any money? We're out of money?
3,21,112,JERRY,"No, of course not, of course not!"
3,21,112,MATTHEW,Mommy!? Jerry says daddy's closing the store. He's going out of
3,21,113,MARYEDITH,Jerry?! What's the matter with you?
3,21,113,JERRY,I didn't--
3,21,113,MARYEDITH,"Boy, I don't know about your friend, Jerry. He says"
3,21,114,KRAMER,"Oh, congratulations."
3,21,114,MARYEDITH,What for?
3,21,114,KRAMER,"Well, you're pregnant."
3,21,114,MARYEDITH,What?
3,21,114,KRAMER,You're not pregnant?
3,21,114,MARYEDITH,"No, I'm not pregnant."
3,21,114,KRAMER,Are you sure you're not pregnant?
3,21,114,MARYEDITH,"Yes, I'm sure!"
3,21,114,KRAMER,That's weird.
3,21,114,MARYEDITH,"Come on, Matthew."
3,21,114,MATTHEW,No.
3,21,114,MARYEDITH,"Come on, Matthew!"
3,21,114,KRAMER,I thought she was pregnant.
3,21,114,JERRY,"Hey, do you think I'm phony?"
3,21,114,ELAINE,What?
3,21,114,JERRY,Mike thinks I'm a phony.
3,21,114,ELAINE,He thinks you're a phony?
3,21,114,JERRY,"Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell"
3,21,115,ELAINE,"Oh, you have to say something."
3,21,115,JERRY,"I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it."
3,21,115,ELAINE,You gotta open the vault.
3,21,115,JERRY,Open my vault?
