3,3,128,GAVIN,Pre-prediction. You'll be calling me to ask if you can come and visit
3,3,132,ELAINE,We made plans.
3,3,132,JERRY,Why don't we just rent a movie?
3,3,132,ELAINE,I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.
3,3,132,JERRY,"No, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long,"
3,3,133,ELAINE,"Jerry, you promised me we'd go."
3,3,133,JERRY,"Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost"
3,3,134,ELAINE,"Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it."
3,3,134,JERRY,You and George got together?
3,3,134,ELAINE,"Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about."
3,3,129,JERRY,Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.
3,3,136,JERRY,What's up?
3,3,136,KRAMER,"Well, you were right."
3,3,136,JERRY,About what?
3,3,136,KRAMER,"Ellen. We, uh, broke up again."
3,3,136,JERRY,Too bad.
3,3,136,ELAINE,I thought she was the one.
3,3,136,KRAMER,I'll bring back the pot.
3,3,136,ELAINE,"Okay, c'mon it's movie time."
3,3,136,KRAMER,"Hey, what are you gonna see?"
3,3,136,JERRY,Prognosis Negative.
3,3,136,KRAMER,"Hey, that's supposed to be great."
3,3,136,JERRY,It's not.
3,3,136,KRAMER,How do you know?
3,3,136,JERRY,I have an instinct for these things.
3,3,10,GAVIN,"Travelling, of course, is the best education. Do you know last year I"
3,3,13,JERRY,Is he on the plane now?
3,3,13,GAVIN,"Oh yes. Yes, he's in the, he's in the baggage compartment. I don't"
3,3,15,JERRY,"Uh, just my next door neighbor."
3,3,15,GAVIN,You're missing out on a relationship that could enrich your life in ways
3,3,16,JERRY,"Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?"
3,3,17,JERRY,What's the matter?
3,3,17,GAVIN,"Oh, I'm feeling a bit queasy."
3,3,19,ATTENDANT #1,"Sir, we're gonna make an emergency landing in Chicago and get you"
3,3,20,GAVIN,My dog. What about my dog?
3,3,20,ATTENDANT #1,"Uh, you have a dog?"
3,3,20,ATTENDANT #2,"Do you know anyone on the plane, Mr. Palone?"
3,3,21,GAVIN,Jerry?
3,3,21,JERRY,Huh? How you feeling?
3,3,21,GAVIN,Would you take care of Farfel?
3,3,21,JERRY,Farfel?
3,3,21,ATTENDANT #2,"It's his dog. We're landing in Chicago to get him to a hospital,"
3,3,22,JERRY,The dog? The dog??
3,3,22,GAVIN,I'm sure it's only for a day or two.
3,3,22,JERRY,"But, you know, what if, you know?"
3,3,22,GAVIN,"Give me your address and phone number, I'll call you."
3,3,22,JERRY,The dog?
3,3,25,JERRY,"Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid"
3,3,26,ELAINE,"Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call."
3,3,26,JERRY,
3,3,28,ELAINE,If only.
3,3,28,JERRY,"Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house"
3,3,30,ELAINE,"Hey, when you walk him, do ya..."
3,3,30,JERRY,Do I what?
3,3,30,ELAINE,Do you pick it up?
3,3,30,JERRY,"Yes, I pick it up."
3,3,30,ELAINE,You pick it up?!?
3,3,30,JERRY,Well you have to.
3,3,30,ELAINE,"Oh, boy would I love to see that."
3,3,30,JERRY,
3,3,31,ELAINE,"Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is."
3,3,31,JERRY,"No, I tried. they don't know anything. (notices Elaine making egg"
3,3,32,ELAINE,"No, milk."
3,3,32,JERRY,"I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender."
3,3,32,ELAINE,What is a bender anyhow?
3,3,32,JERRY,"I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar."
3,3,32,ELAINE,I can't believe he hasn't called.
3,3,32,JERRY,"Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his"
3,3,34,KRAMER,"Sorry, I can't watch the dog tonight."
3,3,34,JERRY,Why?
3,3,34,ELAINE,"We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative."
3,3,34,KRAMER,"I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life."
3,3,34,JERRY,You're breaking up?
3,3,34,KRAMER,"Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You"
3,3,37,ELAINE,"Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did."
3,3,37,KRAMER,"Woah, you didn't like her?"
3,3,37,ELAINE,If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant
3,3,38,JERRY,I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.
3,3,38,KRAMER,How come you never said anything?
3,3,38,JERRY,You can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after
3,3,39,KRAMER,I tell you.
3,3,39,JERRY,You. I'm talking about people.
3,3,39,ELAINE,Are we still going to the movies tonight?
3,3,39,JERRY,"No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me."
3,3,39,ELAINE,Just me and George?
3,3,39,JERRY,Sure.
3,3,39,ELAINE,But we need you.
3,3,39,JERRY,What do you need me for?
3,3,40,ELAINE,Because... Yeah?
3,3,40,GEORGE,Prognosis Negative!
3,3,41,ELAINE,"Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law."
3,3,43,JERRY,"No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's"
3,3,44,ELAINE,Just me and George alone?
3,3,45,GEORGE,"Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha"
3,3,46,JERRY,I can't go.
3,3,46,GEORGE,"Can't go, Why not?"
3,3,46,JERRY,Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.
3,3,46,GEORGE,I thought Kramer was watching.
3,3,46,JERRY,He's breaking up with his girlfriend tonight.
3,3,46,GEORGE,"Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down."
3,3,46,JERRY,"No, I don't want that smell in the house."
3,3,46,GEORGE,You spritz a little Lysol on it.
3,3,46,JERRY,"No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of"
3,3,47,GEORGE,So we're not going?
3,3,47,JERRY,Nah. You two go.
3,3,47,GEORGE,Oh. You still wanna go?
3,3,47,ELAINE,Do you?
3,3,47,GEORGE,If you want.
3,3,47,ELAINE,It's up to you.
3,3,47,JERRY,Go ahead.
3,3,47,ELAINE,"Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh,"
3,3,48,GEORGE,Ponce de Leon? Okay. You sure you don't wanna go?
3,3,48,JERRY,I want to but I can't.
3,3,48,ELAINE,Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean
3,3,50,JERRY,No.
3,3,50,GEORGE,What about this--
3,3,50,JERRY,"Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time."
3,3,50,ELAINE,"I know, it's not that."
3,3,50,GEORGE,It's just we want you to go.
3,3,50,JERRY,"Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!"
3,3,57,GEORGE,So how long did you live there?
3,3,57,ELAINE,About three years.
3,3,57,GEORGE,That's pretty long.
3,3,57,ELAINE,Hmm.
3,3,57,GEORGE,"It's not that long, really."
3,3,57,ELAINE,Yeah. An uncomfortable silence ensues. They both speak at the same
3,3,58,GEORGE,And then you came here.
3,3,58,ELAINE,Yeah. So I've been here about six years.
3,3,58,GEORGE,"Eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight,"
3,3,60,JERRY,Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from
3,3,62,KRAMER,I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do
3,3,66,GEORGE,I like herbal tea.
3,3,67,GEORGE,Chamomile's good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure.
3,3,67,ELAINE,Jerry likes Morning Thunder.
3,3,67,GEORGE,Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?
3,3,67,ELAINE,Yeah.
3,3,67,GEORGE,"Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine."
3,3,67,ELAINE,Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
3,3,67,GEORGE,You don't tell him?
3,3,67,ELAINE,"No. And you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he"
3,3,147,THE END,
3,3,69,GEORGE,You don't tell him?
3,3,69,ELAINE,No.
3,3,69,GEORGE,That is so funny!
3,3,69,ELAINE,I know!
3,3,69,GEORGE,"Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!"
3,3,72,KRAMER,"Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back,"
3,3,75,JERRY,"That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on"
3,3,135,JERRY,Hello.
3,3,80,ELAINE,It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many
3,3,81,JERRY,"Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off."
3,3,81,ELAINE,The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of
3,3,87,JERRY,"Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on"
3,3,88,ELAINE,Do you have to?
3,3,88,JERRY,What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not
3,3,89,ELAINE,"You know, the guy might have just lost your number."
3,3,89,JERRY,I'm in the book and I have a machine.
3,3,89,ELAINE,"Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them"
3,3,90,JERRY,Really? How late are they open?
3,3,91,JERRY,What?
3,3,91,ELAINE,What is it?
3,3,91,KRAMER,I went back with Ellen.
3,3,91,JERRY AND ELAINE,"Ohhhhh, that's great."
3,3,91,ELAINE,Terrific.
3,3,91,JERRY,"Yeah, I really think you guys are good together."
3,3,91,ELAINE,"Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding."
3,3,91,KRAMER,Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?
3,3,91,JERRY,"I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset."
3,3,91,KRAMER,"From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you"
3,3,92,ELAINE,"Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it."
3,3,92,JERRY,What are you doing?
3,3,92,KRAMER,I'm getting my pot.
3,3,93,ELAINE,"Kramer, we like her."
3,3,93,JERRY,Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?
3,3,93,ELAINE,I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.
3,3,93,JERRY,"I said, ""How come no one's killed her?"" Probably shouldn't have said"
3,3,95,GEORGE,Prognosis Negative!
3,3,96,JERRY,"Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on."
3,3,96,ELAINE,"Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault."
3,3,96,JERRY,"It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is."
3,3,96,ELAINE,"Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the"
3,3,97,JERRY,"I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?"
3,3,97,ELAINE,We'll see it Sunday.
3,3,98,GEORGE,"Tonight's the night, right? Prognosis Negative?"
3,3,98,ELAINE,"I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog."
3,3,98,GEORGE,What does this mean?
3,3,98,JERRY,"Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De"
3,3,99,GEORGE,"What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound."
3,3,99,JERRY,"She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go"
3,3,100,GEORGE,"Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?"
3,3,100,JERRY,"I don't know, regular human time?"
3,3,100,GEORGE,Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?
3,3,100,JERRY,Why shouldn't I go here?
3,3,100,ELAINE,"Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure"
3,3,101,GEORGE,And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
3,3,101,ELAINE,Yeah.
3,3,101,JERRY,"Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!"
3,3,101,GEORGE,"Hey, go."
3,3,101,ELAINE,Who's stopping you?
3,3,101,GEORGE,"What, are you doing me a favor?"
3,3,101,ELAINE,Like we care if you go to the bathroom.
3,3,102,GEORGE,How's it going?
3,3,102,ELAINE,Good. Good. You?
3,3,102,GEORGE,Things are good.
3,3,104,ELAINE,"Boy, he takes such a long time."
3,3,104,GEORGE,I know.
3,3,104,ELAINE,You know what he does in there? He gargles.
3,3,104,GEORGE,Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?
3,3,104,ELAINE,"Yeah, he does it like six times a day."
3,3,104,GEORGE,How come we never hear him?
3,3,104,ELAINE,"Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this,"
3,3,106,GEORGE,"Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!"
3,3,106,ELAINE,We talked about that already.
3,3,106,GEORGE,Oh.
3,3,107,GEORGE,I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm
3,3,108,JERRY,So what are calling me six times a day?
3,3,108,GEORGE,"All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get,"
3,3,109,JERRY,I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.
3,3,109,GEORGE,Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.
3,3,109,JERRY,"It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?"
3,3,109,GEORGE,Nothing except Prognosis Negative.
3,3,109,JERRY,"Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me."
3,3,110,ELAINE,"Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with!"
3,3,112,ELAINE,"Shut up. Shut up! Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my"
3,3,115,GEORGE,"I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but"
3,3,116,JERRY,I don't know what to do.
3,3,116,GEORGE,"What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go."
3,3,116,JERRY,"I know, I know."
3,3,116,GEORGE,"So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy."
3,3,116,JERRY,It is kind of silly.
3,3,116,GEORGE,Of course it is.
3,3,116,JERRY,"I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake."
3,3,116,GEORGE,Exactly.
3,3,116,JERRY,It's not like she's *in* the movie.
3,3,116,GEORGE,Right.
3,3,116,JERRY,Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I
3,3,118,GEORGE,"And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it."
3,3,118,JERRY,How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level
3,3,120,GEORGE,Good.
3,3,120,JERRY,Saving movies.
3,3,120,GEORGE,Ridiculous!
3,3,120,JERRY,Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in trouble.
3,3,120,GEORGE,"Oh, you're dead."
3,3,122,GAVIN,"Bell's Palsy. The entire side of my, of, of my face was paralyzed."
3,3,124,JERRY,"You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said"
3,3,125,GAVIN,"Yes, yes, that's true, but then I was taken to the Bell's Palsy Center"
3,3,126,KRAMER,"Hey, c'mon, c'mon, get off me!"
3,3,126,GAVIN,"He won't hurt you, he's just playing."
3,3,126,KRAMER,Hey you keep that mutt away from me.
3,3,126,GAVIN,Mutt? I'll wager his parents are more pure than yours.
3,3,126,ELLEN,"Kramer, are you coming?"
3,3,126,JERRY,"Oh, hi Ellen."
3,3,126,ELLEN,Get in here.
3,3,127,JERRY,"Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week,"
