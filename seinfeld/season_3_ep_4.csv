3,4,0,JERRY,Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book
3,4,1,KRAMER,enters
3,4,1,JERRY,"Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there in like a half hour."
3,4,2,KRAMER,What's the problem?
3,4,2,JERRY,This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer
3,4,3,KRAMER,Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's
3,4,4,JERRY,It doesn't work like that.
3,4,4,KRAMER,"If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000"
3,4,4,JERRY,It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly
3,4,8,JERRY,That orange dress is burned in my memory
3,4,8,KRAMER,"Oh, memory burn."
3,4,8,JERRY,I wonder what ever happened to her.
3,4,8,KRAMER,How did they ever find you?
3,4,8,JERRY,"Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is"
3,4,10,JERRY,It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library
3,4,10,KRAMER,You know I never got a library card.
3,4,10,JERRY,Coming down.
3,4,10,KRAMER,It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading
3,4,11,JERRY,I gotta go to the library. You want to go?
3,4,11,KRAMER,"Yeah,"
3,4,11,KRAMER,"The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned"
3,4,12,JERRY,Where's George
3,4,12,READER,Shhh.
3,4,12,KRAMER,Tryin' to save a quarter.
3,4,12,JERRY,I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them for my house.
3,4,12,JERRY,This woman's completely ignoring me.
3,4,12,KRAMER,Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster.
3,4,15,JERRY,Eventually a little shot of penicillin
3,4,15,LIBRARIAN,Yes?
3,4,15,JERRY,Yes I called before. I got his notice in the mail.
3,4,15,LIBRARIAN,"Oh, Tropic of Cancer, Henry Miller, Uh, this case has been turned over to our"
3,4,16,KRAMER,"Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?"
3,4,16,LIBRARIAN,It's true.
3,4,16,KRAMER,"That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone."
3,4,16,LIBRARIAN,Lt. Bookman has been working here for 25 years so I think he's heard all the jokes.
3,4,16,JERRY,Can I speak with this Bookman?
3,4,16,LIBRARIAN,Just a second.
3,4,16,GEORGE,"Jerry,"
3,4,16,JERRY,What?
3,4,16,GEORGE,I think I saw him. I think it's him.
3,4,16,JERRY,Who?
3,4,16,GEORGE,Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some
3,4,17,JERRY,Yeah.
3,4,17,KRAMER,yeah
3,4,17,GEORGE,I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School.
3,4,17,READER,Shhh.
3,4,17,JERRY,Are you sure?
3,4,17,GEORGE,"He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him."
3,4,17,JERRY,George got him fired. He squealed on him.
3,4,17,KRAMER,Ooh tattle tale
3,4,17,GEORGE,I didn't tattle
3,4,17,READER,Shh Shh
3,4,17,KRAMER,What did this guy do? What happened?
3,4,17,GEORGE,There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.
3,4,17,KRAMER,"Oh come on, You can tell me."
3,4,17,GEORGE,Some other time.
3,4,17,KRAMER,What tonight?
3,4,17,KRAMER,Y'know I never figured you for a squealer.
3,4,17,JERRY,"Oh, he sang like a canary."
3,4,17,LIBRARIAN,Mr. Bookman's not here.
3,4,17,JERRY,Not here? Why was I told to come down here?
3,4,17,LIBRARIAN,He'll be out all afternoon on a case.
3,4,17,KRAMER,He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?
3,4,17,JERRY,Well what am I supposed to do now?
3,4,17,LIBRARIAN,I'll have Mr. Bookman get in touch with you.
3,4,17,JERRY,All right Thanks. Come on lets go
3,4,17,GEORGE,Let's see if it's Hayman?
3,4,17,KRAMER,"Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later. So uh, what's a guy got to do"
3,4,19,ELAINE,Where's Karen?
3,4,19,SECRETARY,She went to pick up lunch.
3,4,19,ELAINE,She didn't ask me what I wanted.
3,4,19,SECRETARY,She must have forgot.
3,4,19,ELAINE,How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years?
3,4,21,SECRETARY,I don't know anything.
3,4,21,ELAINE,"Ah, you don't know anything. You see, ""I don't know anything"", means there's"
3,4,22,ELAINE,"Oh, hi Mr. Lippman."
3,4,22,LIPPMAN,"Elaine,"
3,4,22,ELAINE,"Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of"
3,4,23,LIPPMAN,Yes I did. Yes I did. ... Maureen this water is still too cold.
3,4,23,ELAINE,It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.
3,4,23,ELAINE,I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend.
3,4,24,JERRY,So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!
3,4,24,ELAINE,"What do you know. You've never worked in an office. See,"
3,4,25,GEORGE,"I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because"
3,4,26,ELAINE,What did he do?
3,4,26,GEORGE,"He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, ""Costanza"" He'd say,"
3,4,28,JERRY,I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps
3,4,29,GEORGE,
3,4,29,JERRY,I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse.
3,4,29,GEORGE,Little baked beans
3,4,29,JERRY,Echh
3,4,29,ELAINE,Come on tell me what happened.
3,4,29,GEORGE,"Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym."
3,4,29,GEORGE,... Those spastic shnitzer twins ...
3,4,29,HEYMAN,Can't stand ja ... Can't stand ja
3,4,29,GEORGE,"Yes, Mr. Hayman"
3,4,29,HEYMAN,Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym class.
3,4,29,GEORGE,Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
3,4,29,HEYMAN,"Boxer shorts, ha? Well what brand?"
3,4,29,GEORGE,"I'm not really sure, I..."
3,4,29,HEYMAN,Well let's take a look.
3,4,30,GEORGE,He gave me a wedgie.
3,4,30,JERRY,He got fired the next day.
3,4,30,ELAINE,Why do they call it a wedgie?
3,4,30,GEORGE,Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..
3,4,30,JERRY,They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the
3,4,31,ELAINE,Boys are sick.
3,4,31,JERRY,Well what do girls do ?
3,4,31,ELAINE,We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder.
3,4,32,KRAMER,"Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library"
3,4,40,JERRY,"Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would"
3,4,41,BOOKMAN,You got any coffee?
3,4,41,JERRY,Coffee?
3,4,41,BOOKMAN,Yeah. Coffee.
3,4,41,JERRY,"No, I don't drink coffee."
3,4,41,BOOKMAN,"Yeah, you don't drink coffee? How about instant coffee?"
3,4,41,JERRY,"No, I don't have--"
3,4,41,BOOKMAN,You don't have any instant coffee?
3,4,41,JERRY,"Well, I don't normally--"
3,4,41,BOOKMAN,Who doesn't have instant coffee?
3,4,41,JERRY,I don't.
3,4,41,BOOKMAN,"You buy a jar of Folger's Crystals, you put it in the cupboard, you"
3,4,43,JERRY,Really? I'll have to remember that.
3,4,43,BOOKMAN,You took this book out in 1971.
3,4,43,JERRY,"Yes, and I returned it in 1971."
3,4,43,BOOKMAN,"Yeah, '71. That was my first year on the job. Bad year for libraries."
3,4,48,JERRY,"Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very"
3,4,49,BOOKMAN,"You're a comedian, you make people laugh."
3,4,49,JERRY,I try.
3,4,49,BOOKMAN,"You think this is all a big joke, don't you?"
3,4,49,JERRY,"No, I don't."
3,4,49,BOOKMAN,I saw you on T.V. once; I remembered your name--from my list. I looked
3,4,51,JERRY,Certainly not.
3,4,51,BOOKMAN,"Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp,"
3,4,66,KRAMER,What's wrong?
3,4,66,MARION,It's Bookman the library cop.
3,4,66,KRAMER,So I didn't do anything wrong.
3,4,66,MARION,I'm supposed to be atwork. I could get fired. I shouldn't have come here.
3,4,66,KRAMER,Why don't ya' leave?
3,4,66,MARION,I can't.
3,4,66,JERRY,No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book I n 1971. I have a witness
3,4,69,SH,"Kevin went to a public school, he's the 14 year old? We were gonna' send Marsha"
3,4,70,JERRY,"So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library?"
3,4,70,SH,I remember it like it was yesterday. It was a Friday afternoon. I wore a purple dress.
3,4,70,JERRY,Purple? Ya' sure it wasn't orange?
3,4,70,SH,Positive. And I was chewin' Dentyne. I always chewed dentyne. Remember Jerry? Dentyne?

3,4,74,KRAMER,Read another poem.
3,4,74,MARION,Pressed chest fleshed out west Might be the saviour or a garden pest.
3,4,74,KRAMER,"Wow, that is great. You should be published."
3,4,74,KRAMER,"You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed."
3,4,74,MARIAN,"Oh, yeah. You don't have to be quiet. Listen to the echo: HELLO!"
3,4,74,BOOKMAN,Hello!

3,4,82,GEORGE,"Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down"
3,4,83,JERRY,That was double overtime.
3,4,83,GEORGE,"So I said, ""Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ... "" He doesn't move."

3,4,88,GEORGE,Yes Mr. Hayman.
3,4,88,HEYMAN,Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym class.
