3,8,128,LANDLORD,"Oh, hello Miss Pepper, it's a pleasure to meet you. And"
3,8,130,ELAINE,"Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing."
3,8,130,KRAMER,She does fine work.
3,8,130,LANDLORD,Your father gave me strict orders not to turn the jacket over to
3,8,132,ELAINE,How kind of you.
3,8,132,LANDLORD,"You know, your father has a very extensive wardrobe."
3,8,129,KRAMER,"Yes, yes I am."
3,8,129,LANDLORD,"I've read your book, Professor, and I was quite intrigued by it."
3,8,129,KRAMER,"Uh, yes. Well, it's, uh, very intriguing."
3,8,129,LANDLORD,"Tell me, is it your contention that Shakespeare was an imposter?"
3,8,129,KRAMER,My contention?
3,8,129,LANDLORD,"Yes, your contention."
3,8,129,KRAMER,"Yes, that's my contention."
3,8,129,ELAINE,I heard him contend that.
3,8,129,LANDLORD,It's too bad about your father.
3,8,129,ELAINE,"Oh, it was a frame-up."
3,8,129,LANDLORD,"A fine man, he spoke often of you. He's very proud of the work"
3,8,136,JERRY'S BRAIN,"What's the matter, fella? You look a little tired. Ha ha ha ha"
3,8,137,ISABEL,"Nelson, don't you see? You are a part of me, and I, I am a part of"
3,8,138,JERRY'S PENIS,It's killing me.
3,8,138,JERRY'S BRAIN,That's your move?
3,8,138,JERRY'S PENIS,Yeah.
3,8,138,JERRY'S BRAIN,"Well that's trouble, my friend. That's big trouble. Checkmate!"
3,8,138,JERRY'S PENIS,Getting weak... Losing
3,8,141,JERRY'S BRAIN,Punk.
3,8,141,JERRY,"Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working."
3,8,14,GEORGE,Where'd you meet her?
3,8,14,JERRY,I met her on an elevator.
3,8,14,GEORGE,On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator?
3,8,14,JERRY,"Impossible, right?"
3,8,14,GEORGE,You got less than sixty seconds. That's like dismantling a time bomb.
3,8,15,JERRY,"I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The"
3,8,16,GEORGE,Wow. What'd you say?
3,8,17,JERRY,"You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England."
3,8,18,GEORGE,Wow.
3,8,18,JERRY,Can you believe I did that?
3,8,18,GEORGE,What did she say?
3,8,19,ISABEL,What crop circles?
3,8,20,JERRY,Not a good sign.
3,8,20,GEORGE,Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. (to the newsstand
3,8,21,NEWSSTAND OWNER,Crop circles? Why don't you buy something?
3,8,21,JERRY,You got something in your teeth there.
3,8,21,GEORGE,What?
3,8,21,JERRY,It's green.
3,8,21,GEORGE,"Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all"
3,8,22,JERRY,Did you bump into anybody you knew?
3,8,22,GEORGE,I had a job interview.
3,8,22,JERRY,How'd it go?
3,8,22,GEORGE,Take a guess.
3,8,24,INTERVIEWER,"Well, Mr. Costanza, we have nothing available at the present time,"
3,8,25,GEORGE,"Ok, thanks."
3,8,26,JERRY,"What do you need a job, you got Audrey."
3,8,26,GEORGE,"Yeah, right."
3,8,26,JERRY,What's the matter?
3,8,26,GEORGE,"Oh, nothing."
3,8,26,JERRY,What?
3,8,26,GEORGE,You won't think I'm a bad person?
3,8,26,JERRY,Too late for that.
3,8,26,GEORGE,"'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a"
3,8,27,JERRY,"Yeah, she's got a big nose."
3,8,27,GEORGE,"I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big."
3,8,28,JERRY,It's a schnoz.
3,8,28,GEORGE,"Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little"
3,8,29,JERRY,A little.
3,8,29,GEORGE,"So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be"
3,8,158,AUDREY,I didn't wash.
3,8,158,KRAMER,Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.
3,8,158,ELAINE,Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect
3,8,160,GEORGE,Elaine. Shut up.
3,8,34,JERRY,Stop being so concerned with looks.
3,8,35,JERRY,Have you said anything to her about it?
3,8,35,GEORGE,I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a
3,8,38,JERRY,"Alright, shut up, here they come."
3,8,38,GEORGE,How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.
3,8,168,THE END,
3,8,41,KRAMER,So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house
3,8,45,ELAINE,Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?
3,8,45,KRAMER,"No no, he's never met her. She's in California."
3,8,45,ELAINE,Are you coming with me?
3,8,45,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fianc√©, Peter Von Nostrand."
3,8,45,GEORGE,Why don't you just commit yourself already?
3,8,45,AUDREY,What is so special about this jacket?
3,8,45,ELAINE,He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.
3,8,45,AUDREY,What's the smudge on your hand?
3,8,45,KRAMER,"Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going"
3,8,46,GEORGE,"What, you didn't wash all day?"
3,8,46,KRAMER,"Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at"
3,8,47,AUDREY,It's amazing how many beautiful women live in New York. I actually
3,8,48,KRAMER,"Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job."
3,8,48,ELAINE,Kramer!
3,8,48,KRAMER,What? What?
3,8,48,ELAINE,How could you say something like that?!
3,8,48,KRAMER,What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.
3,8,48,ELAINE,"No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey."
3,8,48,AUDREY,"No, it's ok."
3,8,48,ELAINE,What did you have to say that for?
3,8,48,KRAMER,"Well, I was just trying to help out."
3,8,48,ELAINE,"Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin."
3,8,48,KRAMER,You see what happens when you try to be nice?
3,8,157,AUDREY,Hi.
3,8,157,ELAINE,Hi!
3,8,157,JERRY,Hey.
3,8,157,AUDREY,Hello.
3,8,157,GEORGE,"Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it!"
3,8,157,AUDREY,"Well, it was his doctor. He was wonderful."
3,8,157,ELAINE,"So, will I see you later tonight?"
3,8,157,AUDREY,Not sure.
3,8,157,KRAMER,"Well, I'll check"
3,8,155,KRAMER,So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
3,8,155,ELAINE,"Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"""
3,8,155,JERRY,So I assume the jig was up.
3,8,155,ELAINE,"Yeah, pretty much."
3,8,56,AUDREY,Elaine said I could stay with her another month until Tina gets back.
3,8,57,GEORGE,Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?
3,8,57,AUDREY,You look like you've got something on your mind.
3,8,57,GEORGE,"Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind."
3,8,58,AUDREY,How about him?
3,8,58,GEORGE,They way he just says stuff.
3,8,58,AUDREY,He sure does.
3,8,58,GEORGE,"Yeah. Yeah, he's quite a character."
3,8,58,AUDREY,"So, what did you think?"
3,8,58,GEORGE,About the pizza?
3,8,58,AUDREY,"No, about the nose job."
3,8,58,GEORGE,"Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?"
3,8,58,AUDREY,"Well, I've thought about it, but I don't know."
3,8,58,GEORGE,"Yeah. Not that I care, one way or the other, but"
3,8,60,AUDREY,"I know, they're good."
3,8,60,GEORGE,Peter Jennings had one.
3,8,60,AUDREY,Really?
3,8,60,GEORGE,"Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class"
3,8,61,AUDREY,Uh huh.
3,8,61,GEORGE,"It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist."
3,8,61,AUDREY,I hate the dentist.
3,8,61,GEORGE,It's a cleaning.
3,8,61,AUDREY,So you really think I should do this?
3,8,61,GEORGE,"If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you"
3,8,61,THIS,"Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone"
3,8,62,AUDREY,"Well, maybe I should."
3,8,62,GEORGE,What the hell.
3,8,62,ELAINE,"Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?"
3,8,62,GEORGE,Me? I didn't say anything.
3,8,62,ELAINE,You encouraged her to get one.
3,8,62,GEORGE,I didn't encourage. No encourage.
3,8,62,ELAINE,Peter Jennings had one?
3,8,62,GEORGE,It's possible.
3,8,62,ELAINE,"Well, I think you should accept her for who she is."
3,8,62,AUDREY,"No, George is right. I want to get one."
3,8,62,ELAINE,I think it's a mistake.
3,8,62,GEORGE,"Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one."
3,8,64,GEORGE,"I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it."
3,8,64,JERRY,"Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes."
3,8,64,GEORGE,"Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the"
3,8,65,JERRY,We have time.
3,8,65,GEORGE,"It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face."
3,8,65,JERRY,It is exciting.
3,8,65,GEORGE,"Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but..."
3,8,65,JERRY,"Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever"
3,8,68,GEORGE,You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.
3,8,68,JERRY,Then what?
3,8,68,GEORGE,He still wins but it's not a blowout.
3,8,68,JERRY,She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting
3,8,71,JERRY,I don't want to see this woman anymore but
3,8,73,KRAMER,I'm proud of you.
3,8,74,JERRY,"So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey."
3,8,74,GEORGE,Good for you.
3,8,74,JERRY,"I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was"
3,8,75,GEORGE,It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not
3,8,76,JERRY,It's not like that at all.
3,8,78,ELAINE,How do you even know the jacket is there?
3,8,78,KRAMER,"Well I don't, I'm guessing."
3,8,78,GEORGE,"Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that"
3,8,81,AUDREY,George?
3,8,81,GEORGE,Yeah?
3,8,81,AUDREY,Enough.
3,8,81,JERRY,"Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road."
3,8,81,ELAINE,Are you sure you want us here for this?
3,8,81,AUDREY,Yes.
3,8,81,JERRY,Shouldn't a doctor do it?
3,8,81,AUDREY,"No, he said I could do it. Okay, here goes."
3,8,81,GEORGE,"Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth."
3,8,82,ELAINE,It looks good.
3,8,82,JERRY,Great job.
3,8,82,KRAMER,You got butchered.
3,8,84,JERRY,Let's put him over here.
3,8,84,KRAMER,Where are you going?
3,8,84,AUDREY,To the doctor!
3,8,84,KRAMER,"Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you."
3,8,85,ELAINE,How ya feeling?
3,8,85,GEORGE,Too much salt in my diet.
3,8,85,ELAINE,Can I get you anything?
3,8,85,GEORGE,"Nah, I'm good."
3,8,85,ELAINE,You sure? Anything?
3,8,85,GEORGE,"Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?"
3,8,85,ELAINE,"No, it didn't. No, it didn't."
3,8,85,GEORGE,"It's like, all dented."
3,8,85,ELAINE,Seems to be.
3,8,85,GEORGE,"Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern"
3,8,87,ELAINE,"Shut up, George."
3,8,87,GEORGE,Shut up?
3,8,87,ELAINE,Yeah.
3,8,87,GEORGE,Interesting.
3,8,90,JERRY,"Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!"
3,8,90,KRAMER,"I don't have it, I threw it out."
3,8,90,JERRY,"You're lying! You got it, I want that number!"
3,8,90,KRAMER,"I told you, I threw it out."
3,8,90,JERRY,Give it to me!
3,8,90,KRAMER,"You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise."
3,8,90,JERRY,"Well, I changed my mind, I want that number."
3,8,90,KRAMER,"You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number."
3,8,90,JERRY,"I was lying, give it to me!"
3,8,90,KRAMER,"No, you told me not to!"
3,8,90,JERRY,I want that number!
3,8,90,KRAMER,Alright! Yeah! Yeah!
3,8,143,ELAINE,Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe.
3,8,143,LANDLORD,He is a fine dresser and I'm sure I don't have to tell you he's quite
3,8,144,ELAINE,"My father, really? I had no idea."
3,8,144,LANDLORD,"Yes, they're crazy about him. There was one in particular, came"
3,8,100,AUDREY,The doctor said that they need to build the lateral wall of the septum.
3,8,101,GEORGE,Yeah.
3,8,101,AUDREY,You see this perinasal sinus cavity?
3,8,101,GEORGE,"Oh, I got it."
3,8,101,AUDREY,You see how it's collapsing? That's what's causing this huge dent.
3,8,101,GEORGE,"Yeah, phew."
3,8,101,AUDREY,"So anyway, George, do you know what I was thinking about?"
3,8,101,GEORGE,What?
3,8,101,AUDREY,Remember we talked about taking a trip together?
3,8,101,GEORGE,We did?
3,8,101,AUDREY,"Yeah, we talked about going to Hawaii?"
3,8,101,GEORGE,Hawaii?
3,8,101,AUDREY,"Anyway, I think it would be great to get away after all this."
3,8,104,AUDREY,I never heard that.
3,8,104,GEORGE,Oh yeah. My friend lived there.
3,8,104,AUDREY,We could go to the Caribbean.
3,8,104,GEORGE,"You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane"
3,8,108,AUDREY,"George, I don't think this is working."
3,8,110,ISABEL,"Ever since you came back from the Army, you've changed. I swear"
3,8,111,JERRY,I'm Nelson!
3,8,111,ISABEL,"That's not the line, Jerry."
3,8,111,JERRY,"Alright, alright, I'm sorry. Nothing's changed, Alma, I just"
3,8,112,ISABEL,"I swear, Nelson, sometimes at night, when you're not around, I just go"
3,8,113,JERRY,"Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun."
3,8,113,ISABEL,"Yeah, bowling's good if you're really gross and ugly."
3,8,113,JERRY,Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again.
3,8,115,JERRY'S BRAIN,Well I'm getting a little tired of this. What do you say we
3,8,116,JERRY'S PENIS,"Oh Brain, what are you doing? You cannot beat me. Do you have"
3,8,117,JERRY'S BRAIN,I can't take her anymore. I hate reading her stupid little
3,8,118,JERRY'S PENIS,"Oh, so what? So you read from a little play. You can't put up"
3,8,120,JERRY'S BRAIN,What about tomorrow morning? Do you have any idea what that's
3,8,148,KRAMER,You don't say?
3,8,148,ELAINE,I found it!
3,8,148,LANDLORD,"The woman used to walk around here half naked, sucking Colt 45 from a"
3,8,122,JERRY'S PENIS,"Oh, go read a book."
3,8,122,JERRY'S BRAIN,"Enough chatting, let's play."
3,8,124,ELAINE,You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to
3,8,125,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got"
3,8,126,ELAINE,Yeah.
3,8,126,KRAMER,Wait wait wait wait wait. Here.
3,8,126,ELAINE,What do I need this for?
3,8,126,KRAMER,Because we're engaged.
3,8,126,ELAINE,We're engaged?
3,8,126,KRAMER,Um hm.
3,8,126,ELAINE,"Kramer, this is too big."
3,8,126,KRAMER,It's my mom's.
3,8,127,LANDLORD,Hello?
3,8,127,ELAINE,"Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father"
