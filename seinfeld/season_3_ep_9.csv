3,9,128,GEORGE,What are you talking about?
3,9,128,SECURITY GUARD,"I know who you are, I was watching you."
3,9,128,GEORGE,What are you gonna do? Are you gonna call the police?
3,9,135,KRAMER,Not really.
3,9,135,STEVE,Maybe we should call one of those escort services. I saw one of them
3,9,131,KRAMER,"So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the"
3,9,134,STEVE,"Ah, they turned brown!! Brown!!"
3,9,129,JERRY,Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?
3,9,137,STEVE,"Hey, you want in on this?"
3,9,137,KRAMER,"No, I got a girl in the next building"
3,9,139,VOICE,"Now I want my money, mister, and I ain't leaving until I get it. Now I"

3,9,140,PATTI,"It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, I'm sure."
3,9,140,JERRY,What the hell is going on here?
3,9,140,STEVE,"I don't know, but I gotta do this more often."
3,9,141,PATTI,I'm not gonna go anywhere until I get the rest of my money.
3,9,141,STEVE,"See ya, Jerr. And tell Kramer thanks and I'll call him tomorrow."
3,9,141,JERRY,"Oh, Kramer huh?"
3,9,141,STEVE,"Yeah, he's a hoot. Oh, goodbye, my dear. (trying to kiss Patti's hand"
3,9,15,JERRY,How did you get fleas?
3,9,15,GEORGE,Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they
3,9,16,JERRY,Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.
3,9,16,GEORGE,"That's not funny. So, are you coming to the party?"
3,9,16,JERRY,"I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation. The"
3,9,145,COP,This your apartment?
3,9,145,JERRY,"Yeah, but--"
3,9,145,COP,You're under arrest for solicitation of prostitution.
3,9,145,JERRY,"Wait a second, I--"
3,9,18,GEORGE,You know Ava's gonna be there.

3,9,18,GEORGE,I'll drive.
3,9,18,JERRY,"Oh, well, now you're talking."
3,9,18,GEORGE,It's supposed to be a good party.
3,9,18,JERRY,"What does that mean, good dip?"
3,9,18,GEORGE,"No, there'll be girls there."
3,9,18,JERRY,"There's girls everywhere. I go out of my apartment, there's girls in"
3,9,19,GEORGE,There's a hundred different things here. What's the difference between

3,9,26,GEORGE,"I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten."
3,9,26,JERRY,"Are you sure? Oh boy, here we go."
3,9,26,GEORGE,"Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you"
3,9,27,CASHIER,You gave me a ten.
3,9,27,GEORGE,I'm positive I gave you a twenty.
3,9,27,CASHIER,I know what you gave me.
3,9,27,GEORGE,You owe me ten dollars.
3,9,27,CASHIER,Will you please step aside? Next?
3,9,27,GEORGE,"Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second. Who, in this"
3,9,29,CASHIER,You.
3,9,29,GEORGE,"No, no, no, see you're not really listening."
3,9,29,SECURITY GUARD,What's the problem here?
3,9,29,GEORGE,"No problem. There's no problem. She just owes me ten dollars, that's"
3,9,30,CASHIER,He's claiming short.
3,9,30,SECURITY GUARD,"Alright, let's just take it outside."
3,9,30,GEORGE,"Oh, so you don't believe me either?"
3,9,30,SECURITY GUARD,"Come on, let's go."
3,9,30,GEORGE,"You haven't won. You may think you've won, but you haven't won. Do"
3,9,34,ELAINE,"Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in."
3,9,34,JERRY,"No, let's survey first. Camp here."
3,9,34,GEORGE,Eva.
3,9,35,JERRY,"What could possess anyone to throw a party? I mean, to have a bunch of"
3,9,36,AVA,"So, guess who just sold 129 West 81st."
3,9,36,GEORGE,"Oh no you didn't. Get out, when?"
3,9,36,AVA,Yesterday
3,9,36,GEORGE,I don't believe it.
3,9,36,AVA,Ask Mark.
3,9,36,GEORGE,"Mark, is this true?"
3,9,37,JERRY,"Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it."
3,9,37,ELAINE,"How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my"
3,9,38,JERRY,"Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight. In case one of us"
3,9,40,ELAINE,How old are you?
3,9,40,JERRY,"Thirty-six. What's the signal? Howbout this? Chicken wing? No, no,"
3,9,41,ELAINE,Whatever you want.
3,9,42,GUY,You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?
3,9,42,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah I did."
3,9,42,GUY,So what do you do?
3,9,42,JERRY,I'm a comedian.
3,9,42,GUY,Are you? Lemme ask you something. Where do you get your material?
3,9,42,JERRY,I hear a voice.
3,9,42,GUY,What kind of voice?
3,9,42,JERRY,"A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator."
3,9,42,GUY,How come you keep tapping your head.
3,9,42,JERRY,It's a nervous tic. I'm on L-Dopa.
3,9,43,GUY,"On the other hand, you take a guy like George Washington Carver. The man"
3,9,146,ELAINE,I brought you chicken soup. Is that real fur?
3,9,146,JERRY,Oh boy.
3,9,46,GUY,"Ya know, people tell me I'm a funny guy."
3,9,47,GUY,I've often wondered if he ever worked with the pecan.
3,9,47,ELAINE,"Yeah, me too."
3,9,47,GUY,"Now is that considered a nut, because I know the cashew is a legume."
3,9,48,GEORGE,How's it going?
3,9,48,JERRY,"Great, how about you?"
3,9,48,GEORGE,I can't believe what's happening here. She hasn't taken her hands off
3,9,49,JERRY,How do you account for this?
3,9,49,GEORGE,"I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head."
3,9,49,JERRY,"Well, she obviously liked you all along."
3,9,49,GEORGE,"No, I would have picked up on it. I can always tell when a woman likes"
3,9,53,JERRY,"Anyway, I'm ready to go."
3,9,53,GEORGE,Now?
3,9,53,JERRY,"If not now, when?"
3,9,53,GEORGE,Gimme a half-hour.
3,9,53,JERRY,"Okay, half-hour."
3,9,54,GUY,"Peanut brittle, peanut butter, peanut oil..."
3,9,54,JERRY,Can I talk to you for a second?
3,9,54,ELAINE,"Oh, excuse me. What have you been doing,"
3,9,55,JERRY,"Hey, I was dying over there."
3,9,55,ELAINE,This guy's going off on the peanut. Now pay attention.
3,9,56,ELLEN,"Yeah, I think I've seen you in a club. You talk about a lot of every"
3,9,57,JERRY,Right.
3,9,57,ELLEN,"Yeah, I remember you."
3,9,59,WOMAN,I wonder what happened to my fiancé. I know he's here somewhere.
3,9,60,ELLEN,He's upstairs.
3,9,60,WOMAN,Are you going upstairs? Tell my fiancé I'm looking for him. I have
3,9,61,ELAINE,Maybe the dingo ate your baby.
3,9,61,WOMAN,What?
3,9,61,ELAINE,The dingo ate your baby!
3,9,62,JERRY,You ready?
3,9,62,GEORGE,"Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask."
3,9,62,JERRY,I do favors.
3,9,62,GEORGE,I think something's happening here.
3,9,62,JERRY,What?
3,9,62,GEORGE,I think she wants me to take her home.
3,9,62,JERRY,Wow.
3,9,62,GEORGE,What should I do?
3,9,62,JERRY,Go! What could you do?
3,9,62,GEORGE,What about you and Elaine?
3,9,62,JERRY,We'll get a ride.
3,9,62,GEORGE,Are you sure?
3,9,62,JERRY,"We'll be fine, what did she say?"
3,9,62,GEORGE,She told me she wants-- (Pauses until a woman coming down the stairs
3,9,63,JERRY,What? She said that?
3,9,63,GEORGE,Yeah.
3,9,63,JERRY,Get out of here.
3,9,63,GEORGE,I swear.
3,9,63,JERRY,What did you say?
3,9,63,GEORGE,
3,9,63,JERRY,What did you say?
3,9,63,GEORGE,"Please, it's--"
3,9,63,JERRY,What?
3,9,63,GEORGE,
3,9,63,JERRY,I long for you?
3,9,63,GEORGE,I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.
3,9,63,JERRY,"It's okay, that's not bad."
3,9,63,GEORGE,"I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating."
3,9,64,JERRY,Really?
3,9,64,GEORGE,"That's a lot of pressure. Make love to me. What am I, in the circus?"
3,9,65,JERRY,"Oh, come on."
3,9,65,GEORGE,I can't perform under pressure. That's why I never play anything for
3,9,68,JERRY,"George, you're thinking too much."
3,9,68,GEORGE,"I know, I know, I can't stop it!"
3,9,69,ELAINE,"Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing."
3,9,69,JERRY,Pendant? Those bastards.
3,9,69,ELAINE,Excuse me.
3,9,69,JERRY,"Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office"
3,9,69,ELAINE,Really? Huh. What a world. So we can go now?
3,9,69,JERRY,"Uh, no, he's taking the car."
3,9,69,ELAINE,"Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?"
3,9,69,JERRY,I don't know.
3,9,69,ELAINE,You don't know?
3,9,69,JERRY,Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.
3,9,69,ELAINE,"Oh great, oh, this is great. How could you let him take the car?"
3,9,69,JERRY,"There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code."
3,9,77,ELAINE,Oh look at that. Look at what she's wearing.
3,9,78,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah, alright."
3,9,78,ELAINE,I can't believe she's walking around in that.
3,9,78,JERRY,Just don't make a scene.
3,9,78,ELAINE,"Hey, is that real fur?"
3,9,78,JERRY,Oh boy.
3,9,78,EVA,It better be or my ex-husband owes me an explanation.
3,9,78,GEORGE,"Yeah, good night."
3,9,78,ELAINE,You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so
3,9,79,GEORGE,Could we talk about this some other time?
3,9,79,AVA,Are you a vegetarian?
3,9,79,JERRY,Here we go.
3,9,79,ELAINE,"Yeah, I eat fish occasionally."
3,9,79,AVA,So you're a hypocrite.
3,9,79,GEORGE,"Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect. Anyway-"
3,9,79,AVA,"Well, talk to me when you stop eating fish."
3,9,79,ELAINE,Fish don't feel any pain.
3,9,79,AVA,How do you know? Do you communicate with fish?
3,9,79,ELAINE,"Well, they're not kept in little cages."
3,9,79,AVA,Ever seen a goldfish?
3,9,79,GEORGE,Goldfish.
3,9,79,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish. They're not unhappy."
3,9,79,AVA,"Oh yeah, right. Swim around in a bowl for two weeks and get flushed down"
3,9,80,ELAINE,"Oh yeah, that's right. Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a"
3,9,81,GEORGE,That's why we're here in America.
3,9,81,JERRY,You're beautiful.
3,9,81,ELAINE,Call Kramer.
3,9,81,JERRY,"Alright. Excuse me, this is your party, right?"
3,9,81,STEVE,"No, I just live here."
3,9,81,JERRY,Can I use your phone?
3,9,81,STEVE,What's in it for me?
3,9,81,JERRY,A bigger bill?
3,9,81,STEVE,"He he, go for it."
3,9,82,JERRY,"Krame? Sein. What are you doing? Well, I'm stuck out here on Long"
3,9,86,ELAINE,You sure you don't need any help?
3,9,86,JENNY,"No, not really."
3,9,86,JERRY,I'm sure he'll be here any minute.
3,9,86,JENNY,I want them out of here.
3,9,86,ELAINE,Call him again.
3,9,86,JERRY,"I called, what should I do? We really appreciate this."
3,9,86,JENNY,It's two o'clock in the morning.
3,9,86,JERRY,"Oh, you got the Civil War book. I saw"
3,9,87,ELAINE,Six hundred and twenty million people died.
3,9,87,JERRY,Thousand.
3,9,87,ELAINE,"Thousand. Six hundred and twenty thousand. The horror, the horror."
3,9,89,JERRY,Yes. You're sure there's nothing we can do?
3,9,89,JENNY,"No! I am not going to bed with them in out house, this is"
3,9,90,JERRY,You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here. Mike
3,9,91,ELAINE,"Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for"
3,9,92,JENNY,"You know, it doesn't look as if your friend is coming."
3,9,92,JERRY,"Oh, he's coming."
3,9,92,JENNY,Maybe you should take a look at a train schedule.
3,9,93,JERRY,That's him.
3,9,93,JENNY,I'm going to bed!
3,9,93,ELAINE,Thanks a lot.
3,9,93,JERRY,"Thanks, great party."
3,9,94,KRAMER,"Hey, how ya doing?"
3,9,94,STEVE,"Ah, look who's here."
3,9,94,KRAMER,I'm sorry.
3,9,94,JERRY,"Hey, it's okay."
3,9,94,KRAMER,"I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the"
3,9,95,ELAINE,Then how did you find the place?
3,9,95,KRAMER,"Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that"
3,9,144,PATTI,I ain't leaving.
3,9,144,JERRY,Patti?
3,9,144,PATTI,You got anything to drink?
3,9,144,JERRY,"Alright, how much does he owe you?"
3,9,144,PATTI,Fifty dollars.
3,9,144,JERRY,Fifty dollars.
3,9,98,JERRY,"Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you"
3,9,99,STEVE,No problem.
3,9,99,JERRY,"And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy"
3,9,100,STEVE,"Hey, I might take you up on that."
3,9,100,JERRY,"Here's my address and number. And really, thanks again."
3,9,100,KRAMER,You better zip up. I couldn't get the top on the
3,9,101,ELAINE,But it's cold out.
3,9,101,KRAMER,"Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway."
3,9,102,JERRY,"George, I've been sick all week. Elaine was too. Eighty miles an hour,"
3,9,106,JERRY,Who is it?
3,9,106,VOICE,Mr. Pocatello.
3,9,106,JERRY,Who?
3,9,106,VOICE,You mean you don't recognize my voice?
3,9,107,STEVE,"Jerry, baby!"
3,9,107,JERRY,Do I know you?
3,9,107,STEVE,Boy this comedy's really frying your brain.
3,9,107,JERRY,"I'm sorry, uh-"
3,9,107,STEVE,"See, this is the kind of lasting impression I make on people."
3,9,107,JERRY,"Oh, okay."
3,9,107,STEVE,"You said if I was ever in the city, I'm in the city."
3,9,107,JERRY,You certainly are. What's going on?
3,9,107,STEVE,"I'm just waiting for a lift back to the island, he won't be ready until"
3,9,109,JERRY,"Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend."
3,9,109,STEVE,"Oh, come on, you can come up with something better than that."
3,9,109,JERRY,"No, really, I just got off the phone with him."
3,9,109,STEVE,I understand.
3,9,109,JERRY,"Look, you can hang out here if you want."
3,9,109,STEVE,Don't be so enthusiastic.
3,9,109,JERRY,"No, it's-"
3,9,109,STEVE,I'm not gonna steal anything.
3,9,109,JERRY,"No, of course not, just close the door when you leave."
3,9,109,STEVE,I think I can do that.
3,9,109,JERRY,"Really, I'm sorry. Maybe another time."
3,9,109,STEVE,Yeah. Let's have lunch.
3,9,110,JERRY,"They guy's in my house right now. What a mistake that party was, I"
3,9,111,GEORGE,"Yeah, me either."
3,9,111,JERRY,"Oh, come on."
3,9,111,GEORGE,What come on? Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?
3,9,111,JERRY,I've never had a job.
3,9,111,GEORGE,You know the anxiety you feel on a date? That's what I have every day
3,9,112,JERRY,"That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?"
3,9,112,GEORGE,"Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a"
3,9,147,GEORGE,You had Sgt. Chadway? Me too.
3,9,147,JERRY,He was a nice guy.
3,9,147,GEORGE,"Oh, great guy."
3,9,147,JERRY,Was there a red-headed guy there?
3,9,147,GEORGE,The one with the long sideburns?
3,9,147,JERRY,Yeah.
3,9,147,GEORGE,Where does he come off?
3,9,147,JERRY,"Yeah, I know. There's no call for that kind of attitude."
3,9,147,GEORGE,One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.
3,9,147,JERRY,"Oh, we all hated him."
3,9,119,JERRY,What are you gonna do?
3,9,119,GEORGE,"I have no choice, I'm quitting."
3,9,121,KRAMER,"The party, Long Island?"
3,9,121,STEVE,"Kramer, right?"
3,9,121,KRAMER,"Hey, what are you doing here?"
3,9,121,STEVE,I'm waiting for my ride.
3,9,121,KRAMER,Where's Jerry?
3,9,121,STEVE,He split. Let me ask you something. Is there anything to drink in here
3,9,122,KRAMER,"Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything. (Sensing Steve's"
3,9,124,JERRY,"Alright, I'm gonna get this. This looks good."
3,9,124,GEORGE,How much is that?
3,9,124,JERRY,Nine sixty.
3,9,124,GEORGE,Nine sixty? Give it to me.
3,9,124,JERRY,Why?
3,9,124,GEORGE,"Don't worry, I got it."
3,9,124,JERRY,"What do you mean, you got it?"
3,9,124,GEORGE,I got it.
3,9,125,JERRY,Since when are you treating me to medicine? What are you doing? You're
3,9,126,GEORGE,I'm not stealing it. They owe me ten dollars. They stole from me.
3,9,126,JERRY,You're a lunatic.
3,9,126,GEORGE,"I have to do this, it's a matter of honor."
3,9,126,JERRY,What do you say to a person like you?
3,9,126,GEORGE,Just walk.
3,9,126,JERRY,Oh.
3,9,127,SECURITY GUARD,Scuse me. What do you got there?
3,9,127,GEORGE,What?
3,9,127,SECURITY GUARD,What do you got in your shirt?
3,9,127,GEORGE,"Oh, I was gonna pay for this."
