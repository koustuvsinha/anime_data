4,10,2,JERRY,"You're a hostage, captured by terrorists-"
4,10,2,ELAINE,"Who, me?"
4,10,2,JERRY,"You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing"
4,10,3,ELAINE,"They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention."
4,10,3,KRAMER,"You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off!"
4,10,4,KRAMER,"Hey, Georgie."

4,10,5,JERRY,What's the matter?
4,10,5,GEORGE,My mother caught me.
4,10,5,JERRY,"""Caught"" you? Doing what?"
4,10,5,GEORGE,You know. I was alone..
4,10,5,ELAINE,You mean..?!

4,10,6,JERRY,Where?
4,10,6,GEORGE,
4,10,7,JERRY,"""Glamour""?"
4,10,8,GEORGE,"..So, one thing lead to another.."
4,10,8,JERRY,"So, what did she do?"
4,10,8,GEORGE,"First she screams, ""George, what are you doing?! My God!"" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it."
4,10,8,KRMAER,Man..
4,10,8,GEORGE,"I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up."
4,10,8,JERRY,What did you do?
4,10,8,GEORGE,I zipped up!
4,10,8,ELAINE,"So, she fell?"
4,10,8,GEORGE,"Yeah. Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!"
4,10,8,ELAINE,"No, I guess you couldn't have.."
4,10,8,JERRY,"No, I wouldn't think so."
4,10,8,ELAINE,..done that.
4,10,8,GEORGE,"So, she fell, and then she started screaming, ""My back! My back!"" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital."
4,10,8,ELAINE,How is she?
4,10,8,GEORGE,She's in traction.
4,10,8,ELAINE,"Ok, I'm sorry."
4,10,8,GEORGE,"It's not funny, Elaine."
4,10,8,ELAINE,I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.
4,10,8,GEORGE,"Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, ""Why, George, why?!"".. I said, ""Because it's"
4,10,10,JERRY,"""Glamour""?"
4,10,11,GEORGE,"Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that , again."
4,10,11,ELAINE,"What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?"
4,10,11,GEORGE,All together.
4,10,12,ELAINE,"Oh, gimme a break.."
4,10,12,JERRY,Ohhh yeah.. right.
4,10,12,KRAMER,"Oh, like you're gonna stop?"
4,10,12,JERRY AND ELAINE,C'mon..
4,10,12,GEORGE,You don't think I can?
4,10,12,JERRY,No chance.
4,10,12,GEORGE,You think you could?
4,10,12,JERRY,"Well, I know I could hold out longer than you."
4,10,12,GEORGE,Care to make it interesting?
4,10,12,JERRY,"Sure, how much?"
4,10,12,GEORGE,A hundred dollars.
4,10,12,JERRY,You're on.
4,10,12,KRAMER,"Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this."
4,10,12,JERRY,You?
4,10,12,KRAMER,Yeah.
4,10,12,JERRY,You'll be out before we get the check.
4,10,12,ELAINE,"I want to be in on this, too."
4,10,12,GEORGE AND JERRY,"Ohh, no. No, no, no.."
4,10,12,ELAINE,Why?
4,10,12,JERRY,It's apples and oranges..
4,10,12,ELAINE,What? Why? Why?
4,10,12,JERRY,Because you're a woman!
4,10,12,ELAINE,So what?
4,10,12,JERRY,It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.
4,10,12,ELAINE,Oh.
4,10,12,JERRY,"We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving."
4,10,12,ELAINE,"Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs."
4,10,12,KRAMER,Not everyday.
4,10,12,GEORGE,"Alright, look, you want to be in?"
4,10,12,ELAINE,Yeah!
4,10,12,GEORGE,You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars.
4,10,12,KRAMER,"No, a thousand!"
4,10,12,ELAINE,"No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty."
4,10,12,GEORGE,"Alright, you're in for one-fifty."
4,10,12,JERRY,"Okay, one-fifty."
4,10,12,GEORGE,"Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?"
4,10,12,JERRY,"Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system."
4,10,12,KRAMER,Alright.
4,10,15,GEORGE,"No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course"
4,10,17,JERRY,..Yeah?
4,10,17,GEORGE,Whatever.
4,10,18,JERRY,How is she?
4,10,18,GEORGE,She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight.
4,10,18,JERRY,Yeah?
4,10,18,ELAINE,It's me.
4,10,18,JERRY,Come on up.
4,10,18,GEORGE,"Hey, what are you doing tonight?"
4,10,18,JERRY,Dating Marla.
4,10,18,GEORGE,"Oh, the virgin?"
4,10,18,JERRY,Yeah.
4,10,18,GEORGE,"Any, uh.. progress, there? What's the latest?"
4,10,18,JERRY,"Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead."
4,10,19,KRAMER,"Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across the street."
4,10,20,JERRY,Where?
4,10,20,KRAMER,Second floor from the top. See the window on the left?
4,10,20,GEORGE,Wow!
4,10,20,JERRY,Who walks around the house like that?!
4,10,21,GEORGE,"Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist colony people.."
4,10,21,KRAMER,..Yeah.. yeah..
4,10,21,JERRY,"Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room?"
4,10,21,GEORGE,I would imagine it's all naked.
4,10,21,JERRY,"What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too?"
4,10,21,GEORGE,"They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. One big nude-a-rama."
4,10,22,ELAINE,Hey.
4,10,22,JERRY AND GEORGE,Hey.
4,10,22,ELAINE,"Well, where's my money? Who caved?"
4,10,22,JERRY,Not me.
4,10,22,GEORGE,Not me.
4,10,22,ELAINE,What're you looking at?
4,10,22,JERRY,There's a naked woman across the street.
4,10,22,ELAINE,"This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life. So, my fried, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics"
4,10,23,JERRY,Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it back.

4,10,28,ELAINE,..And then there were three.
4,10,30,ELAINE,"I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a quart of milk, I come home, and find"
4,10,31,GEORGE,Ma.

4,10,67,GEORGE,You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?
4,10,67,ESTELLE,You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a

4,10,73,ELAINE,"Okay, you tryin' to hurt me? Are you tryin' to hurt - you're tryin' to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt me."
4,10,73,JOYCE,He also told me to tell you that he'll be in your neighborhood tomorrow around nine o' clock - so he's gonna stop in front of your building if you want to

4,10,87,JERRY,Come on up!
4,10,87,GEORGE,Where did you get those socks?

4,10,87,GEORGE,I think those are my socks!
4,10,87,JERRY,How are these your socks?!
4,10,87,GEORGE,"I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore!"
4,10,87,JERRY,"Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They looked so good to me, I just had to"

4,10,88,JERRY,They're my socks!
4,10,89,GEORGE,Oh boy..
4,10,89,JERRY,What are we doing here..
4,10,89,GEORGE,..Oh boy.
4,10,89,JERRY,This is ridiculous.
4,10,89,GEORGE,Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting.
4,10,89,JERRY,I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody.
4,10,89,GEORGE,Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street.
4,10,90,ELAINE,Hello..
4,10,90,GEORGE,You caved?!
4,10,90,JERRY,It's over?
4,10,90,GEORGE,You're out?
4,10,90,JERRY,Ohh-my-God. The Queen is dead.
4,10,91,GEORGE,I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring.
4,10,91,JERRY,What happened?
4,10,91,ELAINE,It was..uh.. John-John.
4,10,91,JERRY AND GEORGE,Ohhhhh.. John-John.
4,10,91,JERRY,But you made it through the day before.
4,10,91,ELAINE,"Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight."
4,10,91,JERRY,Why outside here?
4,10,91,ELAINE,"Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up."
4,10,92,JERRY,"Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me."
4,10,92,GEORGE,"And then, there were two."
4,10,92,ELAINE,Elaine Benes Kennedy Junior..
4,10,94,MARLA,Let's go in the bedroom.
4,10,94,JERRY,Really?
4,10,94,MARLA,Yes.
4,10,94,JERRY,You sure?
4,10,94,MARLA,Yes.
4,10,94,JERRY,You really want to?
4,10,94,MARLA,I do. I'm ready.
4,10,94,JERRY,Okay..
4,10,94,MARLA,I know how difficult this must have been for you.
4,10,94,JERRY,You don't know the half of it.
4,10,95,MARLA,What do you mean?
4,10,95,JERRY,"Well, it's kinda silly, but.."
4,10,97,MARLA,Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends?
4,10,97,JERRY,"No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother-"
4,10,97,MARLA,I don't want to hear another word. And to think how close I came to you being the one! I must have been out of my mind.
4,10,99,ELAINE,"Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-"
4,10,99,MARLA,"I don't want to have anything to do with you or your perverted friends. Ooohh, get away from me! You're horrible."
4,10,101,ELAINE,What happened?
4,10,101,JERRY,I told her about the contest.
4,10,101,ELAINE,"Ohh. Boy, she's a whack-o."
4,10,102,GEORGE,"Hey, what happened?"
4,10,102,ELAINE,What?
4,10,102,GEORGE,I thought you were meeting Kennedy.
4,10,102,ELAINE,He didn't show.
4,10,102,GEORGE,"Yeah, he did."
4,10,102,ELAINE,"What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, I gotta go.."
4,10,102,GEORGE,"No, no, no. He just left."
