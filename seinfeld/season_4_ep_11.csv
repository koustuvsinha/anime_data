4,11,0,THE AIRPORT,Written by Larry Charles
4,11,1,JERRY,"...cramped seat, working on a tiny computer; there's always a small problem ""There'll be a slight delay, we'll be a *little* late, if you could be a *little* *patient*! We're just trying to get one of those *little* trucks to pull us up just a *little* closer to the jetway so you can walk down the narrow hallway and there'll be a man there in a tight suit and he'll tell you you have very little time to make your connecting flight. So move it!""."
4,11,2,ELAINE,"Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah..."
4,11,2,JERRY,"Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you shut-up?They both chortle, and Jerry is hot so he's taking his coat off, but Elaine refuses to take the wheel and Jerry's hand gets stuck and before you can say ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"", they collide head-on with a Snapple truck...."
4,11,5,ELAINE,Hey guess what? This window doesn't work.
4,11,5,JERRY,"I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works: the window doesn't work,"
4,11,7,ELAINE,Gimme ten bucks and find out...
4,11,7,JERRY,"So, this worked out pretty good. Them givin' me an extra ticket, y'know, you get a free trip to St. Louis, I did my gig, you got to"
4,11,8,ELAINE,"Yeah, worked out good."
4,11,8,JERRY,And here's the beauty--
4,11,8,ELAINE,What?
4,11,8,JERRY,George is pickin' us up at the airport.
4,11,8,ELAINE,Get out of here! Why?
4,11,8,JERRY,You know that awning outside my building?
4,11,8,ELAINE,Yeah...
4,11,8,JERRY,"He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning."
4,11,8,ELAINE,So what happened?
4,11,8,JERRY,He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's wavin at it...
4,11,10,ELAINE,"Hey, how we doin' on time?"
4,11,10,JERRY,"Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane..."
4,11,11,ELAINE,Hey! Wait up!
4,11,11,JERRY,Hey! Wait up!
4,11,11,DRIVER,Sorry. Heh heh heh...
4,11,13,SKYCAP,Where you goin'?
4,11,13,JERRY,"Uh, JFK. I need some small bills for a tip. You"
4,11,14,ELAINE,"Yeah, you want five?"
4,11,14,JERRY,Gimme ten.
4,11,14,ELAINE,You're giving him *ten* dollars?
4,11,14,JERRY,"Well, we got three bags."
4,11,14,ELAINE,That's a pretty big tip...
4,11,14,JERRY,That's what they get!
4,11,14,ELAINE,They don't get that much.
4,11,14,JERRY,Let's ask him.
4,11,14,ELAINE,We can't ask him...
4,11,14,JERRY,Let's see what he says.
4,11,14,ELAINE,"Jerry, we don't have time for this..."
4,11,14,JERRY,"Two seconds. Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip."
4,11,14,SKYCAP,"Depends on the person, depends on the bag."
4,11,14,JERRY,"Uh, how about a couple of people like us."
4,11,14,SKYCAP,"People like you? I wouldn't expect much, you don't even look like"
4,11,15,JERRY,"C'mon, seriously..."
4,11,15,SKYCAP,"Well, since you asked, usually, I get five dollars a bag."
4,11,16,ELAINE,What!?
4,11,16,SKYCAP,That's right.
4,11,17,ELAINE,*Five* dollars a bag? I don't think so.
4,11,17,SKYCAP,"Look, you asked, I told you."
4,11,17,ELAINE,You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us...
4,11,17,JERRY,"All right, look, we're late. Thank you very much..."
4,11,17,ELAINE,You're lucky I don't report you...
4,11,17,SKYCAP,...Honolulu.
4,11,18,ELAINE,Wait up!
4,11,18,JERRY,"You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. 'Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... You wanna make this plane, you've gotta run like a man!"
4,11,20,JERRY+ELAINE,The flight's been canceled?!?!
4,11,20,TICKET LADY,"Everything into JFK's booked... No, wait-- I have two seats"
4,11,21,JERRY,We'll take 'em!
4,11,21,ELAINE,We're not going to sit together?
4,11,21,JERRY,"Well, so what? It's not that long-- you'll read."
4,11,21,ELAINE,"Well, what about George? He's supposed to pick us up at Kennedy."
4,11,21,JERRY,We'll call him...
4,11,21,ELAINE,There's no time.
4,11,21,JERRY,No time? Is there time?
4,11,21,TLADY,There's no time.
4,11,21,JERRY,"There's no time. All right, we'll call him from the plane."
4,11,21,TLADY,"I have one seat in first class, and one in coach. The price is the same since your flight was canceled."
4,11,21,JERRY,I'll take the first class.
4,11,21,ELAINE,Jerry!
4,11,21,JERRY,What?
4,11,21,ELAINE,Why should you get the first class?
4,11,21,JERRY,"Elaine, have you ever flown first class?"
4,11,21,ELAINE,No.
4,11,21,JERRY,All right then. See? You won't know what you're missing. I've
4,11,22,ELAINE,You flew here coach.
4,11,22,JERRY,"Yeah, that's a point..."
4,11,22,ELAINE,"All right, fine. I don't care. If the plane crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway."
4,11,22,JERRY,"Yeah, I'm sure you'll live."
4,11,23,ATTENDANT #1,Third row right...
4,11,24,ATTENDANT #1,"Oh, you're in here, sir. Welcome aboard."
4,11,24,JERRY,"Bon voyage, Lainey!"
4,11,24,PASSENGER #1,"Oh, excuse me... Um, excuse me, miss, I think you're"
4,11,26,PASSENGER #1,I never check my bags-- I can't stand that wait in the baggage area.
4,11,26,ELAINE,Great... Help me...
4,11,26,TIA,"Excuse me, I think you're in my seat..."
4,11,26,JERRY,"Oh, sorry... My mistake... Thank... *you*!"
4,11,28,GEORGE,"Hey, thanks for coming with me."
4,11,28,KRAMER,"Hey, what made you think you could touch that awning?"
4,11,28,GEORGE,I confused it with another awning.
4,11,28,KRAMER,So how we doin' on time?
4,11,28,GEORGE,"We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up."
4,11,30,GEORGE,What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway?
4,11,31,KRAMER,Will you relax?!
4,11,31,GEORGE,"Oh, I had it perfectly timed out: the Grand Central, the Van Wyck!"
4,11,32,KRAMER,This is the best way to go!
4,11,32,GEORGE,Do you know what happens if I miss him? I don't get credit for the pickup and I lose my 50 bucks...
4,11,32,KRAMER,"George, there's no traffic at this time. Now, come on, man..."
4,11,32,GEORGE,Really?
4,11,32,KRAMER,"If anything, we'll probably get there early. I'll have a chance to"
4,11,33,GEORGE,The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail.
4,11,34,KRAMER,Duty.
4,11,34,GEORGE,"Yeah, ""duty"". Do you know how much duty is?"
4,11,34,KRAMER,"No, I dunno how much duty is."
4,11,34,GEORGE,Duty is *nothing*. It's like sales tax...
4,11,34,KRAMER,I still like to stop at the duty free shop.
4,11,34,GEORGE,I like to stop at the duty free shop.
4,11,34,G+K,I like to stop at the duty free shop!
4,11,36,TIA,"So, he says, ""squeeze your breasts together"", and I say, ""I thought this was an ad for shoes""..."
4,11,36,JERRY,Oh my...
4,11,37,TIA,Is that the new Esquire? Turn to page
4,11,38,JERRY,Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good thing they gave you
4,11,40,JERRY,What is this an ad for?
4,11,40,TIA,"See those wrinkled jeans slung over the chair? Way in the background, out of focus?"
4,11,40,JERRY,Uh-huh...
4,11,41,KRAMER,How does it look on your side? We'll get there...
4,11,42,ELAINE,"Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful."
4,11,42,GEORGE,They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!
4,11,42,KRAMER,Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees!
4,11,42,GEORGE,"Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a half-hour late, they've probably took it off the board already."
4,11,42,KRAMER,"No, there it is, right there-- 133... and it's canceled."
4,11,42,GEORGE,Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here!
4,11,42,KRAMER,"Ok, c'mon... let's go check over at the ticket counter."
4,11,42,GROSSBARD,"Oh, there it is honey, gate 18A, 8:30..."
4,11,42,KRAMER,Did you see that guy?
4,11,42,GEORGE,No... What guy?
4,11,42,KRAMER,That guy.. He was just...
4,11,42,GEORGE,"Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name!"
4,11,42,KRAMER,I know that guy...
4,11,43,PRISONER,Gotta get my Time magazine... Never miss my Time magazine.
4,11,43,GUARD,"Yeah, get your magazine and let's get out of here."
4,11,44,PRISONER,"Hey, I was gonna take that!"
4,11,44,GEORGE,"Gee, I'm sorry... I got here first."
4,11,44,PRISONER,"I don't care when you got here, I want the magazine..."
4,11,44,GEORGE,"You don't understand, there's a *blurb* about me in this magazine!"
4,11,44,PRISONER,"A *blurb*?!? *You're* a blurb! Check out the cover, idiot!"
4,11,44,GUARD,"All right, let's go..."
4,11,45,PRISONER,I want the magazine!
4,11,45,GEORGE,Umm... No.
4,11,45,PRISONER,"You know what I would do to you, if I wasn't in these shackles..."
4,11,45,GEORGE,"But you are Blanche... You *are* in the shackles. Oh, I can't wait to read my *Time* magazine! Laaaast copy, too. Maybe I'll read it tomorrow-- in the park! It's supposed to be a beeyootiful day! Have a nice life... sentence, that is!"
4,11,47,KRAMER,"They're on a different flight. They're scheduled to land in a half hour, only at Laguardia."
4,11,47,GEORGE,"Laguardia? All right, let's go. C'mon..."
4,11,47,KRAMER,Where do I know that guy from?
4,11,48,ELAINE,"Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! *Wake*"
4,11,51,JERRY,Oh my... that *is* refreshing...
4,11,51,ATTENDANT,Would you care for some slippers?
4,11,51,JERRY,Sounds lovely! May I?
4,11,51,TIA,Please!
4,11,51,JERRY,"Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella."
4,11,52,GEORGE,My name is not mentioned in this blurb...
4,11,53,KRAMER,It's Grossbard!
4,11,54,GEORGE,Who's Grossbard?
4,11,54,KRAMER,"When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago, I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent. Then one month,"
4,11,56,GEORGE,"Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty years ago..."
4,11,56,KRAMER,"No, I'm gonna turn around... I'm gonna get that guy..."
4,11,56,GEORGE,"No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You *cannot* abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract."
4,11,58,JERRY,"Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there."
4,11,58,ATTENDANT,"They're gardenias, mostly."
4,11,58,JERRY,I thought I smelled lilac.
4,11,58,ATTENDANT,"Yes, there are a few of those, too..."
4,11,58,TIA,It's almost overwhelming...
4,11,58,CAPTAIN,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Due to equipment problems at the runway at Laguardia, we've been"
4,11,59,ELAINE,What'd he say? What'd he say?
4,11,60,GEORGE,"Well, You're not gonna believe it..."
4,11,60,KRAMER,What?
4,11,60,GEORGE,The plane's been re-routed *back* to Kennedy. We've got 45 minutes.
4,11,60,KRAMER,"Let's go. Listen to the bell, Grossbard-- it tolls for thee."
4,11,61,ATTENDANT,"We have some *delicious* Chateau Briande, my personal favourite."
4,11,62,JERRY,"Oh, saffron! That sounds good."
4,11,62,ATTENDANT,And today we're featuring wines from the *Tuscany* region...
4,11,62,JERRY+TIA,Tuscany!
4,11,64,ELAINE,Hi. Can I get to my seat?
4,11,64,ATTENDANT,You're just gonna have to wait...
4,11,64,ELAINE,But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy...
4,11,64,ATTENDANT,You're not supposed to get up during the food service.
4,11,64,ELAINE,"Well, nobody *told* me that!"
4,11,64,ATTENDANT,Look. This plane is *full*. I got a lot of people to serve.
4,11,66,GEORGE,There it is. Gate 46... We got plenty of time.
4,11,66,KRAMER,Grossbard's plane leaves in ten minutes. I *still* got time to
4,11,67,GEORGE,How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded the plane already.
4,11,67,KRAMER,Gimme your credit card.
4,11,67,GEORGE,My credit card?
4,11,67,KRAMER,"Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions."
4,11,67,GEORGE,I'm not gonna give you my card unless you tell me what it's for!
4,11,67,KRAMER,I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on that flight.
4,11,67,GEORGE,"What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard."
4,11,67,KRAMER,"No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna get my money, I'll get"
4,11,68,GEORGE,This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer
4,11,72,ELAINE,"Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through."
4,11,73,PASSENGER 1,You're not supposed to get up during the food service.
4,11,73,ELAINE,I'll try and remember that. Where's my meal?
4,11,73,PASSENGER 1,"He asked me where you were, and you were gone so long I thought you, uh, switched seats."
4,11,74,ELAINE,"Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal."
4,11,74,ATTENDANT,Are you sure?
4,11,74,ELAINE,"Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me."
4,11,74,ATTENDANT,Would you?
4,11,75,ATTENDANT,"Well, the only meal left is a kosher meal."
4,11,75,ELAINE,Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.
4,11,75,PASSENGER 1,"I think it means when a Rabbi has inspected it, or something."
4,11,75,PASSENGER 2,"No, no. It all has to do with the way they kill the pig."
4,11,75,PASSENGER 1,They don't eat pigs!
4,11,75,PASSENGER 2,They do if it's killed right-- under a Rabbi's supervision.
4,11,76,PASSENGER 3,"Oh, You know what? *I* ordered the kosher meal."
4,11,76,ELAINE,Then why didn't you take it?
4,11,76,PASSENGER 3,"I ordered it six weeks ago, I forgot."
4,11,76,ELAINE,You're eating my food!
4,11,76,ATTENDANT,"Look, I got earplugs to collect. Do you want it, or not."
4,11,78,J+T,Mmmmmmmm!
4,11,78,TIA,This is the best sundae I've ever had.
4,11,78,JERRY,"Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge on the bottom-- y'see?"
4,11,79,TIA,I've never met a man who knew so much about nothing.
4,11,79,JERRY,Thank you...
4,11,79,J+T,Mmmmmm!
4,11,80,ATTENDANT,More anything?
4,11,80,JERRY,More everything!
4,11,82,KRAMER,"Look, I got Super Savers! C'mon."
4,11,82,GEORGE,Super Savers? Are they refundable!?
4,11,83,GEORGE,"You bought non-refundable tickets, you idiot!"
4,11,83,KRAMER,She talked me in to it-- she said it was the best deal.
4,11,83,GEORGE,Do you know how much this is going to cost me?
4,11,83,KRAMER,"Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split it with you"
4,11,84,GEORGE,"Look, I'm gonna go to the bathroom..."
4,11,86,ATTENDANT,Excuse me... Excuuuse me...
4,11,86,ELAINE,"What? Oh, no... nothing for me thanks."
4,11,86,ATTENDANT,What is your name?
4,11,86,ELAINE,Elaine Benes?
4,11,86,ATTENDANT,You're going to have to go back to coach.
4,11,86,ELAINE,"No, but there was nobody sitting here..."
4,11,86,ATTENDANT,"Yes, but you're still not allowed. These seats are very expensive."
4,11,86,ELAINE,"Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there..."
4,11,87,ATTENDANT,You're going to have to go back to your seat!
4,11,87,ELAINE,"Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal should be a society *without* *classes*! Do you realise that the people up here are getting *cookies*!"
4,11,88,JERRY,"What is all the racket back there? You know, you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up with."
4,11,89,ATTENDANT,"Sir, this woman tried to *sneak* into first class."
4,11,89,JERRY,"Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door."
4,11,90,KRAMER,Hey! That guy owes me 240 bucks!
4,11,92,JERRY,Couldn't be...
4,11,95,JERRY,Where are they already? I don't see them anywhere...
4,11,96,JERRY,"I got my bags, I'm ready to go."
4,11,96,ELAINE,"Yeah, *you* got *your* bags..."
4,11,97,ELAINE,The worst flight I have been on in my entire life.
4,11,97,JERRY,"Yeah, me too..."
4,11,98,TIA,I'll call you.
4,11,98,JERRY,Okay... It's a business thing...
4,11,99,KRAMER,You guys ready?
4,11,99,JERRY,Yeah. Where's George?
4,11,100,JERRY,"But I have to admit, I like flying. I like those little bathrooms that they have on the plane. It's kind of like a small apartment of your own on the plane. You go in, you close the door, the light comes on. It's like a small surprise party every time you go in there. The worst way of flying, I think is ""standby"", you ever fly standby? It never works, you know, that's why they call it standby--"
4,11,102,THE END,
