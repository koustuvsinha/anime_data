4,13,1,JERRY,What's with the age gap hiring policy at most movie theaters? Didja
4,13,12,JERRY,You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another
4,13,12,KERNIS,"I hear you, guy."
4,13,12,JERRY,"And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the"
4,13,13,KERNIS,Why don't you come back and do the 11 o'clock spot?
4,13,13,JERRY,"No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie ""CheckMate"""
4,13,13,BUCKLES,"Hey, Jer!"
4,13,13,JERRY,Heeeeyyyyyyyy.....
4,13,13,GEORGE,"Excuse me, do you have a ticket?"
4,13,13,MAN,No.
4,13,13,GEORGE,Okay. Good.
4,13,13,BUCKLES,Jerry!
4,13,13,JERRY,What are doing here?
4,13,13,BUCKLES,"Hey, do you think this is funny? ""Why do they call it athlete's"
4,13,15,ELAINE,"I've been *dying* to see ""CheckMate""."
4,13,15,GEORGE,"Well, if it's as good as ""Ponce de Leon"", I'll be happy."
4,13,15,ELAINE,"""Ponce de Leon"", are you kidding me? I hated that movie!"
4,13,15,GEORGE,"""Ponce de Leon""? But that was great!"
4,13,15,ELAINE,"Oh, . That Fountain of Youth scene at the end, where"
4,13,18,GEORGE,Lemme tell you sum'in. When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw
4,13,20,KRAMER,"Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Payapa King."
4,13,20,G+E,"No, wait!"
4,13,20,GEORGE,You're not going to get back here in time!
4,13,20,KRAMER,"I'm starvin', I haven't had any dinner!"
4,13,20,ELAINE,You can get a hot dog in the theater.
4,13,20,KRAMER,I don't wanna get a movie hot dog!
4,13,21,ELAINE,"Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second, and then this line is"
4,13,22,KRAMER,"Well, just save me a seat."
4,13,22,ELAINE,No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once
4,13,24,GEORGE,I'm in line to buy.
4,13,24,ELAINE,"No, George, this is the ticket- line."
4,13,24,GEORGE,"No it's not, it's the ticket- line."
4,13,24,ELAINE,Then how come we're not moving?
4,13,24,KRAMER,Good question.
4,13,24,GEORGE,"Is this the ticket holders line, or the buyers?"
4,13,24,MAN,Holders.
4,13,24,GEORGE,"But I asked you before if you had a ticket, and you said no!"
4,13,24,MAN,I didn't. My friend was getting it.
4,13,24,GEORGE,Good. It's good to be accurate like that.
4,13,24,ELAINE,Can you believe him?
4,13,24,KRAMER,He's spaced out.
4,13,24,ELAINE,How long would *you* have stood in the ticket-holders line?
4,13,24,KRAMER,
4,13,24,ELAINE,"Yeah, exactly..."
4,13,24,ELAINE,I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater!
4,13,24,GEORGE,It's the same movie! What's the difference?
4,13,24,ELAINE,"It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to"
4,13,25,JERRY,Take the Park!
4,13,25,BUCKLES,"No no no, take 55th."
4,13,25,BUCKLES,"Jerry, I want you to do me a favor. No more fish!"
4,13,25,JERRY,
4,13,26,BUCKLES,I had a point?
4,13,26,GEORGE,"Hey, you know what else is playing here? ""Rochelle Rochelle""."
4,13,26,ELAINE,Sigh/Ugh.
4,13,26,GEORGE,I wouldn't mind seein' .
4,13,26,ELAINE,"Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most boring movie if"
4,13,28,GEORGE,So what's your point?
4,13,28,GEORGE,"By the way, you owe me seven fifty."
4,13,28,ELAINE,"Oh, all right. Can you break a twenty?"
4,13,28,GEORGE,"No, I don't have any change."
4,13,28,ELAINE,"Oh, well, then I'll pay you later."
4,13,28,GEORGE,"Or, I could take the twenty, then I could pay *you* later."
4,13,28,ELAINE,"Yeah, you *could*..."
4,13,28,GEORGE,Might be easier.
4,13,28,ELAINE,"I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve"
4,13,29,GEORGE,"(trying to act as if he doesn't care one way or the other, but we"
4,13,30,ELAINE,Yeah.
4,13,30,GEORGE,So... Can I have it?
4,13,30,ELAINE,"I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda."
4,13,30,GEORGE,"Whaddya mean, you'll ""get"" the popcorn and the soda?"
4,13,30,ELAINE,I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even.
4,13,30,GEORGE,"I tell you what, you give me the twenty, and I will buy"
4,13,31,ELAINE,"George, you're sappin' my strength."
4,13,31,GEORGE,You go in and save seats.
4,13,31,ELAINE,Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save three
4,13,32,BUCKLES,"Jerry, I want you to have this piece of material."
4,13,32,JERRY,"That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices."
4,13,32,BUCKLES,Jerry! Don't start up with me!
4,13,32,JERRY,I gotta get out of this cab...
4,13,32,BUCKLES,"But Jerry, quit riffing!"
4,13,32,JERRY,"No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the"
4,13,33,BUCKLES,Can you help me get on The Tonight Show?
4,13,33,ELAINE,"No, these are saved."
4,13,33,MAN,"All of them? C'mon, you can't take *four* seats."
4,13,33,ELAINE,"What, is that a rule?"
4,13,33,GEORGE,"Well, why don't *you* go, and I could save the seats. You said you"
4,13,34,ELAINE,
4,13,36,GEORGE,"Why don't you give me the twenty, and I'll stop and get change,"
4,13,37,ELAINE,"Can we do this later, George?"
4,13,37,GEORGE,Psh. What's the point of even discussing it? (condescendingly
4,13,40,KRAMER,"Could you do me a favor? If you see a guy that's five foot eleven,"
4,13,42,ELAINE,"No, I'm sorry, these are taken. ..."
4,13,44,WOMAN,Which one?
4,13,44,ELAINE,These two and this one. ...
4,13,46,ELAINE,"Oh, take 'em."
4,13,46,GEORGE,"Um, excuse me, have you see a guy with like a horse face,"
4,13,47,CLERK,... flared nostrils?
4,13,47,GEORGE,Yeah.
4,13,47,CLERK,"Nope, haven't seen him."
4,13,47,BUCKLES,"Jerry, could you do me a personal favor? And if I'm out of line,"
4,13,49,JERRY,Your trench coat in my closet?
4,13,49,BUCKLES,"Jerry, my closet is packed to the gills, I'm afraid to open the"
4,13,51,BUCKLES,"We should see ""Rochelle Rochelle"". I hear it's really hot."
4,13,51,JERRY,"No thanks, maybe some other time."
4,13,51,BUCKLES,Really? Do you really mean that?
4,13,51,JERRY,"No, I don't."
4,13,51,BUCKLES,"You liked the athlete's foot bit, right?"
4,13,51,JERRY,No. No. I was kidding. It's terrible.
4,13,51,JERRY,"Hi, I got some friends inside, I gotta get a message to 'em."
4,13,52,USHER,
4,13,52,KRAMER,"Hey, did that guy show up?"
4,13,52,CLERK,The guy with the... horse face... and the big teeth...
4,13,52,KRAMER,"No, the guy with the big head and the flared nostrils."
4,13,52,CLERK,Haven't seen him. There was a short guy with glasses...
4,13,53,WOMAN,"So I got home, and he was vacuuming! I mean, he's twelve years old!"
4,13,54,WOMAN,"And then last night, he put on my high heels. Oh, he put on such a"
4,13,56,ELAINE,"Excuse me, excuse me."
4,13,56,WOMAN,What's the problem?
4,13,56,ELAINE,
4,13,57,WOMAN,"It's the ""Coming Attractions""."
4,13,57,WOMAN,"So anyway, he sings, he dances. And do you know what he's gotten"
4,13,58,USHER,"Ticket, sir?"
4,13,58,GEORGE,"Uh, I just went out, I went to look for my friend?"
4,13,58,USHER,Do you have your stub?
4,13,58,GEORGE,My `stub'?
4,13,58,USHER,Mm hm.
4,13,58,GEORGE,You don't remember me?
4,13,58,USHER,"It's a big city, sir."
4,13,58,GEORGE,"I went in with a pretty woman? You know, kinda short, big wall o'"
4,13,59,GEORGE,Elaine?
4,13,61,GEORGE,Elaine!
4,13,61,NARRATOR,The Village Voice calls it a masterpiece. A young woman's
4,13,62,NARRATOR,It's a story about life. And love. And becoming a woman.
4,13,63,ELAINE,"Uh, could I have a medium Diet Coke?"
4,13,63,CLERK,Do you want the Medium size or the middle size?
4,13,63,ELAINE,What's the difference?
4,13,63,CLERK,"Well, we have three sizes. Medium, Large, and Jumbo."
4,13,63,ELAINE,What happened to the small?
4,13,63,CLERK,There is no small. Small is Medium.
4,13,63,ELAINE,What's... medium?
4,13,63,CLERK,"Medium is Large, and large is Jumbo."
4,13,63,ELAINE,Oh-kay. Gimme the large.
4,13,63,CLERK,That's medium.
4,13,63,ELAINE,Right. Yeah. Could I have a small popcorn?
4,13,63,CLERK,There is no small. Child-size is small.
4,13,63,ELAINE,What's `medium'?
4,13,63,CLERK,Adult.
4,13,63,ELAINE,Do adults ever order the child-size?
4,13,63,CLERK,Not usually.
4,13,63,ELAINE,"Okay, gimme the `adult'."
4,13,63,CLERK,Do you want butter?
4,13,63,ELAINE,Is it *real* butter?
4,13,63,CLERK,It's butter-*flavored*!
4,13,63,ELAINE,What is it made of?
4,13,63,CLERK,It's yellow!
4,13,63,JERRY,44th and 9th.
4,13,63,DRIVER,Have you got a cigarette?
4,13,63,JERRY,No.
4,13,63,USHER,"Ticket, sir?"
4,13,63,GEORGE,We've just been through this! You don't remember? We just had
4,13,64,USHER,I need to see your stub.
4,13,64,GEORGE,I've got the stub.
4,13,64,GEORGE,"There you go, okay? That's my *other* friend's ticket."
4,13,65,USHER,"Ticket, sir?"
4,13,65,KRAMER,"Uh, no, see, my friend already bought me a ticket."
4,13,66,USHER,Go ahead.
4,13,66,KRAMER,Is that seat taken?
4,13,66,WOMAN BEHIND ELAINE,It's all yours.
4,13,66,DRIVER,"I'm very sorry, you give me few minutes."
4,13,67,JERRY,Gasoline? Can't you get it after you drop me off?
4,13,67,DRIVER,No! Impossible! It is on `Empty'!
4,13,67,MAN,You're soaking wet. Who are you?
4,13,67,ROCHELLE,"My name is Rochelle, I'm from Milan."
4,13,68,MAN,"Here, stand by the fire. Take off those wet clothes,"
4,13,69,ROCHELLE,"Oh, my hand's so cold, I can barely get these buttons open."
4,13,69,ROCHELLE,"Oh, that's much better. Much..."
4,13,69,ELAINE,I just went to get popcorn... Ugh...
4,13,71,USHER,There's a seat in the front row.
4,13,71,ELAINE,"No no, I can't sit in the front row."
4,13,71,USHER,"Well, you're going to have to wait, then."
4,13,71,ELAINE,I can't stand around here for *two hours*!
4,13,71,USHER,"I could let you see ""Rochelle Rochelle""."
4,13,71,ELAINE,Oh. Thanks.
4,13,71,ELAINE,"Oh, hey, listen, by the way, have you seen a tall... lanky..."
4,13,73,USHER,Haven't seen him.
4,13,73,JERRY,"Hey, did I make it?"
4,13,73,KERNIS,Sorry.
4,13,73,JERRY,"Oh, great. That's great. What a night."

4,13,74,BUCKLES,That athlete's foot bit killed!
4,13,74,JERRY,Really...
4,13,74,BUCKLES,Do you think I need to lose some weight?
4,13,74,JERRY,Weight? Naw. Just need some more height.
4,13,74,JERRY,My whole night's ruined.
4,13,75,BUCKLES,"Come on, we can still catch most of ""Rochelle Rochelle""."
4,13,75,JERRY,"""Rochelle Rochelle"", huh?"
4,13,75,BUCKLES,"A young girl's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk."
4,13,75,JERRY,Minsk?
4,13,75,ELAINE,"Oh, gimme a break!"
4,13,75,JERRY,Elaine?

4,13,75,GEORGE,Elaine?
4,13,75,ELAINE,George!
4,13,75,JERRY,"Hey, where's Kramer?"
4,13,75,VOICE,Will you shut up?
4,13,75,ELAINE,I don't know. Does this movie stink or what!
4,13,75,JERRY,Let's get outta here. I'll see ya.
4,13,75,BUCKLES,You're leaving?
4,13,75,JERRY,Yeah.
4,13,75,BUCKLES,"Jerry, take the coat. Please. One month."
4,13,75,JERRY,I don't want the coat.
4,13,75,BUCKLES,Jerry! Call me when you get home so I know you're okay!
4,13,75,GEORGE,Oh man! Look at this! I sat in gum.
4,13,76,JERRY,I didn't even use the ticket!
4,13,76,GEORGE,I still paid for it!
4,13,76,JERRY,I only have a twenty.
4,13,76,ELAINE,That's my coat! Gimme that. Where did you get that?
4,13,76,KRAMER,It was on the seat...
4,13,76,ELAINE,
4,13,76,GEORGE,You uh owe me for the ticket.
4,13,76,KRAMER,"Yeah, right..."
4,13,76,ELAINE,What is that stain ?
4,13,76,KRAMER,It's yellow mustard. Can you break a twenty?
4,13,76,JERRY,"I always get confused in the movie theater by the, by the plot."
4,13,86,THE END,
