4,14,40,ELAINE,Why?
4,14,40,GEORGE,Well I think I'm better off going one-on-one.
4,14,40,JERRY,I don't know why you want to play man-to-man when you could play a zone.
4,14,40,GEORGE,She might not be comfortable.
4,14,40,ELAINE,"Why? We're all very nice, we're very friendly."

4,14,50,GEORGE,"Oh no no no, they don't want to join us."
4,14,50,CHERYL,"Oh no, it's ok, don't be silly."
4,14,50,ELAINE,"Ok, well why don't we just put these two tables together?"
4,14,50,GEORGE,"No, no, you can't do that, they're round, it makes an 'eight' and, yeah, well alright."
4,14,50,ELAINE,"Jerry? Jerry, tell them that funny story you were telling me--"
4,14,50,GEORGE,No! No.
4,14,50,ELAINE,"No George, it's so funny. We saw this cab driver's picture, right?"
4,14,50,GEORGE,"You know we should really order, the service is so slow"
4,14,51,ELAINE,"Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you a legal question? Um, I'm being sued."
4,14,51,CHERYL,Oh? What happened?
4,14,51,ELAINE,"Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin and I crossed against the"
4,14,52,CHERYL,Was he Chinese?
4,14,52,ELAINE,Yeah.
4,14,52,CHERYL,Is your last name Benes?
4,14,52,JERRY,How did you know?
4,14,52,CHERYL,Ping is my cousin!
4,14,52,ELAINE,No!
4,14,52,JERRY,That's so funny!
4,14,52,CHERYL,I'm handling his case!
4,14,52,ELAINE,What? You're Cheryl Fong?
4,14,52,CHERYL,That's right!
4,14,53,ELAINE,"Oh my god, I can't believe it! That is such a coincidence!"
4,14,53,CHERYL,"Yeah, I know!"
4,14,53,ELAINE,"Wow, well, I guess you don't have any advice for me on how to win the"
4,14,54,CHERYL,Will you excuse me? I have to make a call.
4,14,54,ELAINE,Tell Ping I said hello.
4,14,54,JERRY,Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open.
4,14,55,GEORGE,What are you doing? What are you doing?
4,14,55,JERRY,What?
4,14,55,GEORGE,This is not good. This is not good.
4,14,55,JERRY,What's the matter?
4,14,55,GEORGE,I just don't think it's such a great idea for you to sit here.
4,14,55,JERRY,Why not?
4,14,55,ELAINE,"He thinks that if you're too funny, he might not look so funny."
4,14,55,JERRY,Biff?
4,14,55,GEORGE,What?
4,14,55,JERRY,You're not worried about that?
4,14,55,GEORGE,"No, of course not."
4,14,55,JERRY,"I mean, so what if I'm funny? Who cares?"
4,14,55,ELAINE,"He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show, she'll walk"
4,14,56,JERRY,"Well, should we leave?"
4,14,56,GEORGE,"Maybe you don't have to be so funny. I mean, would it kill you not to"
4,14,59,ELAINE,This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there?
4,14,59,JERRY,"I don't have to be funny, I don't care."
4,14,59,GEORGE,You don't?
4,14,59,JERRY,No way! It's completely under my control.
4,14,59,ELAINE,"No, it's not. You cannot not be funny."
4,14,59,JERRY,"Of course I can, am I being funny now?"
4,14,59,ELAINE,A little.
4,14,59,JERRY,"Oh, this is funny? I'm being funny?"
4,14,59,ELAINE,Yeah.
4,14,59,JERRY,"George, is this funny?"
4,14,59,GEORGE,It's funny! and it wouldn't kill you to not be so funny
4,14,60,ELAINE,What? What did I do?
4,14,61,GEORGE,Hi.
4,14,61,JERRY,Hello. Welcome back.
4,14,61,CHERYL,"Sorry, it was my aunt's birthday and she makes such a big deal about"
4,14,62,ELAINE,"Well, nobody likes to get old, right?"
4,14,62,JERRY,"Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and"
4,14,66,GEORGE,"Funny guy, huh?"
4,14,67,ELAINE,"Here, take it. I was glad to get rid of it."
4,14,67,JERRY,"Well thank you very much, it's about time."
4,14,67,ELAINE,"Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against"
4,14,68,JERRY,"Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money."
4,14,68,ELAINE,"Yeah, no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune."
4,14,68,JERRY,"Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and"
4,14,70,JERRY,Hear that? Guess who's back. Hey!
4,14,70,KRAMER,Hey.
4,14,70,JERRY,I thought you weren't coming back till Monday.
4,14,70,KRAMER,"Well, the camp ended a few days early."
4,14,70,JERRY,Why?
4,14,70,KRAMER,"Uh, well there was an incident."
4,14,70,JERRY,What happened?
4,14,70,KRAMER,I punched Mickey Mantle in the mouth.
4,14,70,JERRY,What?
4,14,70,KRAMER,"Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they"
4,14,71,ELAINE,You punched who in the mouth?
4,14,71,KRAMER,Mickey Mantle.
4,14,71,JERRY,What happened?
4,14,71,KRAMER,"Well, you know, we were playing a game and, you know, I was pitching,"
4,14,73,JERRY,Wow! Joe Pepitone!
4,14,73,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate. So I"
4,14,76,JERRY,You plunked him.
4,14,76,KRAMER,"Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the"
4,14,81,JERRY,"Wow, this is incredible!"
4,14,82,BABU,Leave me alone! You can't do this to me!
4,14,82,JERRY,What's going on out there?
4,14,82,BABU,"What are you doing? This is not right, people. You're making a very bad"
4,14,83,JERRY,Babu? I'll be right back.
4,14,83,ELAINE,"Yeah, so?"
4,14,83,KRAMER,"Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, ""Mickey! Mickey! What have"
4,14,84,ELAINE,So what'd you do?
4,14,84,KRAMER,"Well, I got the hell out of there."
4,14,84,JERRY,They took Babu away!
4,14,84,ELAINE,They took Babu away?!
4,14,84,JERRY,"Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu,"
4,14,86,BABU,Jerry! Jerry! Help me!
4,14,86,JERRY,"I will, Babu! I will help you, Babu, don't worry!"
4,14,86,KRAMER,"Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's chasing me around, he trips over third"
4,14,87,JERRY,Uh oh.
4,14,87,ELAINE,What?
4,14,87,JERRY,Well this is interesting.
4,14,87,ELAINE,What is it?
4,14,87,JERRY,"It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal"
4,14,88,KRAMER,"Well, doesn't he need that?"
4,14,89,JERRY,"If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing"
4,14,90,ELAINE,"Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up."
4,14,90,JERRY,"Yeah, so am I being funny now?"
4,14,90,ELAINE,"No, actually, you're not being funny now."
4,14,90,JERRY,"See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time. Hey"
4,14,91,GEORGE,"No, and you weren't funny last night either. In fact, you got us both"
4,14,92,JERRY,"Oh look, I need to get in touch with Cheryl. Babu needs a lawyer, his"
4,14,93,GEORGE,What do you need her for? There's a million lawyers.
4,14,93,JERRY,"Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does."
4,14,93,GEORGE,"Alright, alright, but no funny business, same deal as last night."
4,14,93,JERRY,"Ah, will you stop it already?"
4,14,93,GEORGE,"Jerry, please?"
4,14,93,JERRY,How long is this gonna go on?
4,14,93,GEORGE,Till I'm comfortable.
4,14,93,JERRY,"Well, when is that gonna be?"
4,14,93,GEORGE,After consummation.
4,14,93,JERRY,Consummation? I don't think you have enough material.
4,14,94,CHERYL,I actually have a friend in the Immigration Department who owes me a
4,14,95,JERRY,That's wonderful news. Thank you.
4,14,95,CHERYL,"You're a very serious person, aren't you?"
4,14,95,JERRY,"Well, with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy, it doesn't"
4,14,96,CHERYL,I understand.
4,14,97,CHERYL,I think it's curdled.
4,14,97,JERRY,I don't care.
4,14,97,CHERYL,Do you ever laugh?
4,14,97,JERRY,"Not really. Sometimes, when I'm in the tub."
4,14,97,CHERYL,That's so sad. What do you do?
4,14,97,JERRY,"I'm a comedian. Oh, let me get that. You've"
4,14,98,ELAINE,"Hey, we're gonna go see Babu now, right?"
4,14,98,JERRY,"Yeah, I'll just pay for this."
4,14,98,ELAINE,"Oh, I'm just gonna go say hi to Cheryl."
4,14,99,CHERYL,Hi.
4,14,99,ELAINE,"Listen, gosh, I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping to drop"
4,14,100,CHERYL,"Well, after we met, you were all so nice. I just couldn't go through"
4,14,101,ELAINE,You're kidding.
4,14,101,CHERYL,"No, I'm not."
4,14,102,JERRY,Babu!
4,14,102,BABU,"Jerry! Jerry, hello Jerry!"
4,14,102,JERRY,You remember Elaine.
4,14,102,BABU,"Yes, yes of course!"
4,14,102,ELAINE,Nice to meet you.
4,14,102,BABU,So nice of you both to come.
4,14,102,JERRY,"Oh, Babu."
4,14,102,BABU,"No no, you're both very kind, very kind."
4,14,102,JERRY AND ELAINE,"Oh, well, you know."
4,14,102,ELAINE,We try.
4,14,102,JERRY,We do what we can.
4,14,102,ELAINE,We do what we can.
4,14,102,BABU,The problem is I never got my Visa renewal form in the mail. I was
4,14,103,JERRY,"Yes, well, see, here's the thing, Babu. Um, what happened was I was"
4,14,104,BABU,Comedy shows! You're a very funny man.
4,14,104,JERRY,"Well, Elaine here was picking up my mail while I was away, because you"
4,14,105,BABU,"Oh yes, of course. TV Guide, magazines, everything. You know, I would"
4,14,106,JERRY,"Oh, I don't want to bother you."
4,14,106,BABU,"No bother! You get me job, you get me apartment, you very very good man."
4,14,106,JERRY,"So yesterday, after they took you away, I looked in my mail and I"
4,14,107,BABU,Come again?
4,14,107,JERRY,"You see, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my mail"
4,14,108,ELAINE,"Yeah, but Babu, he could have come to my house to pick it up."
4,14,108,BABU,You had my Visa application?!
4,14,108,JERRY,Well not technically.
4,14,108,BABU,I kill you!!
4,14,108,JERRY,Well what about her?
4,14,108,BABU,I kill both of you!!
4,14,108,JERRY,Babu?!
4,14,108,BABU,No Babu! No Babu! You bad man! You very bad man! You very lazy bad
4,14,109,JERRY,"Babu, I'm gonna fix everything! I have a lawyer who knows someone in"
4,14,111,BABU,The wheels are in motion?
4,14,111,JERRY,"The wheels are in motion, things are happening!"
4,14,112,GEORGE,Jerry?
4,14,112,CHERYL,I'm very attracted to him.
4,14,112,GEORGE,You think the person you were talking to is him? That's not even close
4,14,113,CHERYL,He never said anything funny.
4,14,113,GEORGE,He can't not be funny.
4,14,113,CHERYL,"No no no, he's dark. And disturbed."
4,14,113,GEORGE,Dark and disturbed? His whole life revolves around Superman and
4,14,117,CHERYL,So you're telling me Jerry's whole thing was an act?
4,14,117,GEORGE,"Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that needs"
4,14,118,CHERYL,I gotta go.
4,14,118,GEORGE,"Well, should I call you later?"
4,14,118,CHERYL,Please don't.
4,14,118,GEORGE,"But, but I'm disturbed! I'm depressed! I'm inadequate! I got it"
4,14,120,ELAINE,"So, what's up with Babu? How come he's not back?"
4,14,120,JERRY,"I don't know, I don't understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take care"
4,14,121,GEORGE,It's George.
4,14,121,JERRY,C'mon up.
4,14,122,JERRY,Babu must be back.
4,14,122,BABU'S BROTHER,"Babu, my goodness, what has happened to you?"
4,14,122,JERRY,Where's Babu?
4,14,122,BABU'S BROTHER,He is in Pakistan!
4,14,122,JERRY,Who are you?
4,14,122,BABU'S BROTHER,"I am his brother. He knew a lawyer, it was all going to be"
4,14,123,JERRY,I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could.
4,14,123,BABU'S BROTHER,Then where is Babu? What happened to Babu? Show me Babu!
4,14,123,ELAINE,Snapple?
4,14,123,BABU'S BROTHER,"No, too fruity."
4,14,124,JERRY,"Hey, what happened? I thought Cheryl was gonna help Babu get his Visa."
4,14,124,GEORGE,She didn't help him?
4,14,124,JERRY,No.
4,14,124,GEORGE,Where is he?
4,14,124,JERRY,He's in Pakistan.
4,14,124,GEORGE,Oh boy.
4,14,124,JERRY,"What do you mean, oh boy?"
4,14,124,GEORGE,"Well, last night she told me that she liked you. Not you, the"
4,14,125,JERRY,"Told her the truth? Well, you got Babu deported."
4,14,125,GEORGE,"What do you mean, I got? You didn't give him his Visa application."
4,14,125,JERRY,That's because she had my mail.
4,14,126,ELAINE,"Yeah, well I wouldn't have had to get your mail if he hadn't gone to"
4,14,127,KRAMER,"Well, I just came back from Mickey Mantle's restaurant."
4,14,127,JERRY,How could you go in there?
4,14,127,KRAMER,"Well, I had to. I had to apologize. I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle,"
4,14,128,JERRY,"Well, what happened?"
4,14,128,KRAMER,"I got down in my knees and went, ""Go ahead, Mickey. Hit me. I'm"
4,14,130,ELAINE,"So, what did he do?"
4,14,130,KRAMER,"Well, the four of them, they picked me up by my pants and they threw me"
4,14,132,VOICE,Kramer?
4,14,132,KRAMER,Yeah? It's my Chinese food.
4,14,133,ELAINE,"Oh! Ping! Hi! Listen, thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit"
4,14,134,PING,Not anymore.
4,14,134,ELAINE,What?
4,14,134,PING,"Cheryl call me last night, lawsuit back on."
4,14,134,ELAINE,Why?
4,14,134,PING,She call you and your friends big liars. You think she nice girl? Wait
4,14,139,BABU,So his friend got the mail but she did not give it to him. And then he
4,14,142,BABU'S FRIEND,"This is a terrible story, Babu. What are you going to do?"
4,14,142,BABU,"I'm going to save up every rupee. Someday, I will get back to America,"
