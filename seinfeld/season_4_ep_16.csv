4,16,1,JERRY,"I don't know about you, but I'm getting sick of pretending to be excited"
4,16,9,ALLISON,I don't want to *live*! I don't want to *live*!
4,16,9,GEORGE,Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to live because
4,16,10,ALLISON,No... You're *something*.
4,16,10,GEORGE,You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and
4,16,11,ALLISON,You're good. You're *good*!
4,16,11,GEORGE,I'm bad. I'm *bad*!
4,16,11,ALLISON,You're *killing* me!
4,16,11,GEORGE,So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She threatened
4,16,12,ELAINE,Over you?
4,16,12,GEORGE,"Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?"
4,16,13,GEORGE,"I got two tickets to see ""Guys And Dolls""."
4,16,13,ELAINE,I got him a two-line phone.
4,16,14,JERRY,Unbelievable! She's not there.
4,16,14,GEORGE,What paper does she write for?
4,16,14,JERRY,The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in
4,16,16,ELAINE,Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that...
4,16,16,JERRY,"Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately..."
4,16,16,ELAINE,Really?
4,16,16,ELAINE,"Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?"
4,16,16,JERRY,Living or all time?
4,16,16,ELAINE,All time.
4,16,16,JERRY,"Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends"
4,16,17,ELAINE,I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?
4,16,17,GEORGE,Lyndon Johnson was uglier than Degaulle.
4,16,17,ELAINE,I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree.
4,16,17,ELAINE,"Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? I mean you"
4,16,18,GEORGE,"So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love."
4,16,18,JERRY,What's the matter with you?
4,16,18,GEORGE,"C'mon, go along..."
4,16,18,JERRY,I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose-
4,16,18,STEPPING PAST ME,"""C'mon Jerry, go along, go along..."""
4,16,18,JERRY,Y'know I hear that all the time.
4,16,18,ELAINE,Hear what?
4,16,18,JERRY,That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.
4,16,18,ELAINE,"Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too."
4,16,18,JERRY,"Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat."
4,16,18,ELAINE,And you get along well with women.
4,16,18,GEORGE,I guess that leaves me in the clear...
4,16,18,GEORGE,"I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno"
4,16,19,JERRY,"Oh yeah, what? ""Buck Naked""?"
4,16,19,GEORGE,"Yeah, how did you know that?"
4,16,19,JERRY,You told me that already like two months ago.
4,16,19,GEORGE,Allison bought it for me.
4,16,19,JERRY,How you gonna get out of *that* one?
4,16,19,GEORGE,I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die.
4,16,19,JERRY,He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?
4,16,19,SHARON,"Sure, I'd like to talk to him, too."
4,16,19,GEORGE,Jerry did you wash this pear?
4,16,19,JERRY,"Yeah, I washed it."
4,16,19,GEORGE,It looks like it hasn't been washed.
4,16,19,JERRY,So *wash* *it*.

4,16,19,GEROGE,Let me ask you something. What do you think of this shirt?
4,16,19,SHARON,It's nice.
4,16,19,GEORGE,Jerry said he didn't like it.
4,16,19,JERRY,I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K...
4,16,19,GEORGE,"No, you said you didn't like it..."
4,16,19,JERRY,"Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of the world, or"
4,16,20,SHARON,So how did you two meet?
4,16,20,JERRY,"Actually, we met in the gym locker room."
4,16,20,GEORGE,Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes
4,16,23,SHARON,Do you guys live together?
4,16,23,JERRY,Live together?
4,16,23,GEORGE,"No, I got my own place."

4,16,31,JERRY,She says she's not going to play up that angle of the story. She
4,16,34,GEORGE,Y'know... I could hear you on the other line...
4,16,34,JERRY,What are you talkin' about?
4,16,34,GEORGE,"I heard what you said: ""Sharon, are you there?""."
4,16,34,JERRY,"You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?"
4,16,34,GEORGE,"Yes, I heard you!"
4,16,34,JERRY,"Well, maybe she was disconnected."
4,16,34,GEORGE,Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation!
4,16,34,JERRY,"Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can hear anything,"
4,16,35,KRAMER,Yello?

4,16,36,ELAINE,"So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused, and then she"
4,16,37,JERRY,"She wouldn't take her coat off at my house, either."
4,16,37,GEORGE,Y'know there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep your coat on
4,16,38,JERRY,"So you don't take your coat off, and now everyone at NYU thinks I'm gay."
4,16,39,GEORGE,Not at all.
4,16,39,GEORGE,"Two tickets to ""Guys And Dolls""! I'm gonna go with you!"
4,16,39,JERRY,"""Guys And Dolls""? Isn't that a lavish, Broadway musical?"

4,16,45,MRS. S,"They weren't culottes, they were shorts."
4,16,45,MR. S,They were culottes! You bought them in the girl's department.
4,16,45,MRS. S,"By mistake! By mistake, Jerry! I'm sorry!"
4,16,45,MR. S,"It looked like he was wearing a skirt, for crying out loud!"
4,16,45,JERRY,"Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!"
4,16,45,MRS. S,"Not that there's anything wrong with that, Jerry."

4,16,54,GEORGE,"Oh, my God..."
4,16,54,JERRY,What?
4,16,54,GEORGE,"She hasn't seen the article! When she sees it, she's gonna think--"
4,16,55,ALLISON,Yeah? So?
4,16,55,GEORGE,Yeah so??
4,16,55,ALLISON,Well this is nice. They mention your name.
4,16,55,GEORGE,Don't you see what it says here? Don't you understand what that's

4,16,56,ALLISON,You're *gay*?
4,16,56,GEORGE,Extraordinarily gay. Steeped in gayness.
4,16,56,ALLISON,I don't believe it.
