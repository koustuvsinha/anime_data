4,17,4,GEORGE,Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English.
4,17,4,JERRY,"Yeah, how about a mute?"
4,17,4,GEORGE,A mute would be good.
4,17,4,JERRY,"Ah, where you gonna meet a mute?"
4,17,4,GEORGE,This is what my life has come to... Tryin to meet a mute.
4,17,4,GEORGE,"I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing. There's a void, Jerry,"
4,17,5,JERRY,"A deep, yawning chasm..."
4,17,5,GEORGE,There's gotta be more to life than this. What gives you pleasure?
4,17,5,JERRY,Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and I'm on
4,17,6,ELAINE,Hey boys!
4,17,6,JERRY,Hey! How you doin'?
4,17,6,ELAINE,"Good. Okay, well, it's all set. I start tomorrow."
4,17,6,GEORGE,Start what?
4,17,6,ELAINE,I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens.
4,17,6,GEORGE,*Really*.
4,17,6,ELAINE,"Yeah. God, I can't tell you how I feel! I mean, I feel *so*"
4,17,8,GEORGE,"Volunteer work, huh?"
4,17,8,JERRY,What're you gonna do down there?
4,17,8,ELAINE,"Well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment and,"
4,17,10,JERRY,That's what I do with him
4,17,10,GEORGE,When did you get this idea?
4,17,10,ELAINE,Last time I had lunch with you here. You were going *on* and *on*
4,17,12,JERRY,"What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me?"
4,17,12,GEORGE,And... and anybody can do this?
4,17,12,ELAINE,Yup.
4,17,12,GEORGE,Helping people... Of course. Of course! It makes perfect sense!
4,17,13,ELAINE,What about you?
4,17,13,JERRY,"Nah, it's not for me."
4,17,13,ELAINE,"Jerry, if anybody should be doing this, it's you."
4,17,13,GEORGE,What *kind* of a person are you?
4,17,13,JERRY,I think I'm pretty much like you-- only successful.
4,17,13,AGENCY REP,This is a wonderful thing you're doing. They're so grateful
4,17,16,GEORGE,"Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' like a good person."

4,17,17,GEORGE,Ben Cantwell. 85. Huh... You think we'll make it to that age?
4,17,17,JERRY,*We*? No.
4,17,17,KRAMER,"So what's up, Diggity Dog?"
4,17,17,JERRY,George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer
4,17,18,KRAMER,"Oh, that's too bad. Now don't say I didn't try to warn you."
4,17,18,JERRY,What're you talkin' about?
4,17,18,KRAMER,"Oh, Jerry, I'm *surprised* at you!"
4,17,18,JERRY,What?
4,17,18,KRAMER,It's a *con*. These agencies are usually a front for some money
4,17,20,JERRY,Where do you *get* this?
4,17,20,KRAMER,"The alternative media, Jerry. That's where you hear the truth."

4,17,22,KRAMER,"Y'know, we'd take them off your hands, free of charge."
4,17,22,GEORGE,"Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living, Newman?"
4,17,22,NEWMAN,I'm a United States postal worker.
4,17,22,GEORGE,Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a
4,17,23,NEWMAN,Sometimes...
4,17,23,JERRY,Why *is* that?
4,17,23,NEWMAN,Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and
4,17,27,RON,I'll give you five bucks.
