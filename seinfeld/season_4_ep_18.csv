4,18,0,THE IMPLANT,Written by Peter Mehlman
4,18,3,SIDRA,"Oh, hi Jerry."
4,18,3,JERRY,"Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of course there's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour."
4,18,3,SIDRA,Really.
4,18,3,JERRY,"Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare."
4,18,3,SIDRA,"Well, I'm done. I think I'm gonna go take a sauna."
4,18,3,JERRY,"Alright, I'll see you Thursday night, right?"
4,18,3,SIDRA,Thursday night.
4,18,3,JERRY,Alright.
4,18,4,ELAINE,Good workout?
4,18,4,JERRY,Tremendous workout.
4,18,4,ELAINE,That's a pretty girl.
4,18,4,JERRY,Tremendous girl.
4,18,4,ELAINE,She's the one you went out with last night?
4,18,4,JERRY,Yeah. I really like her.
4,18,4,ELAINE,"You know, uh...they're fake."
4,18,4,JERRY,What? Don't say that!
4,18,4,ELAINE,Nah! They're fake!
4,18,4,JERRY,How do you know?
4,18,4,ELAINE,I can tell. You know how you're always bragging how you can spot a lesbian?
4,18,4,JERRY,"I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye. Hi, how ya doin.'"
4,18,4,ELAINE,"Oh, right. C'mon, don't you think they seem a bit too perfect?"
4,18,4,JERRY,"Yes, they do!"
4,18,4,ELAINE,I never knew you were so into breasts. I thought you were a leg man.
4,18,4,JERRY,A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? I don't need legs. I have legs. Have you ever seen her naked in the locker room?
4,18,4,ELAINE,No.
4,18,4,JERRY,"Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked."
4,18,4,ELAINE,I don't want to see her naked.
4,18,4,JERRY,"Well, I do."
4,18,4,ELAINE,"Well, that's your problem."
4,18,4,JERRY,"Look, you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up."
4,18,4,ELAINE,"Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna?"
4,18,4,JERRY,Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative journalism. I need to know!
4,18,4,ELAINE,But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself!
4,18,4,JERRY,"Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's on his ninth date with Betsy, he still hasn't gotten anywhere with her."
4,18,4,ELAINE,What's his problem?
4,18,4,JERRY,"Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side."
4,18,4,ELAINE,Wrong side?
4,18,4,JERRY,"Yeah, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left."
4,18,4,ELAINE,He can't go left.
4,18,4,JERRY,"No! I'm lefty, can't go right. What about women? Do they go left or right?"
4,18,4,ELAINE,"Nah, we just play defense."
4,18,5,GEORGE,Can I ask you a question? Would you mind switching seats?
4,18,5,BETSY,"Oh, actually, I really prefer to sit here. I don't hear very well out of this ear so, I always try to sit to the right of people."
4,18,5,GEORGE,I'll shout.
4,18,5,BETSY,"Well, I really think I feel more comfortable here."
4,18,5,GEORGE,"C'mon, c'mon... See, now, is that so bad?"
4,18,5,BETSY,What?
4,18,5,GEORGE,"No, no, the machine'll get it..."
4,18,5,BETSY,"No, no, it's not on..."
4,18,5,GEORGE,They'll call back.
4,18,5,BETSY,"But George, what if it's an emergency?"
4,18,5,GEORGE,"In the whole world right now, there's maybe three emergencies. Why would you think, on this entire planet, that you're one of those three?"
4,18,5,BETSY,"George, please. Hello? What? Oh my god!"
4,18,5,GEORGE,"Alright, maybe four."
4,18,6,ELAINE'S BRAIN,"Boy, I'm really sweatin.' Good sweat, beads of sweat...sweatin' bullets. Look at her. I don't need to see her naked to know those aren't real. Why does she need to tie the towel around her? She's got a rack on her chest. Oh god! Sidra's takin' the towel off! Whoa, doctor! That's it, I knew it! I knew it, they're definitely fake."
4,18,7,BETSY,"So, when's the funeral? Well, Aunt Clarice was so ill, I guess it was really a blessing. Yeah, I'll fly home as soon as I can. O.k. You, too. Get some sleep."
4,18,8,JERRY,You're sure?
4,18,8,ELAINE,Positive! This chick's playin' with confederate money.
4,18,8,JERRY,"Well then, that's it. That's the end of that."
4,18,8,ELAINE,What? Just 'cause of that?
4,18,8,JERRY,Just 'cause of that? It's like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat!
4,18,8,ELAINE,"Oh, come on! You've dated women with nosejobs, what's the difference?"
4,18,8,JERRY,"You don't touch the nose! You don't aspire to reach the nose. You don't unhook anything to get to a nose, and no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostril."
4,18,8,ELAINE,"You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you?"
4,18,8,JERRY,"Well, I take it very seriously."
4,18,8,ELAINE,"You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool."
4,18,9,KRAMER,Hey.
4,18,9,JERRY,"Hey. You know, I do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like."
4,18,9,KRAMER,"Well, I know what they feel like."
4,18,9,JERRY,You? How do you know?
4,18,9,KRAMER,"Well, I lived in Los Angeles for three months."
4,18,9,ELAINE,I thought you hated Los Angeles.
4,18,9,KRAMER,"I do! I just miss the warm weather, y'know? Jeez. Oh man, I wish I could get away."
4,18,9,JERRY,Real busy now down at the office?
4,18,9,KRAMER,No. Huh? You know who I saw at the health club? Salman Rushdie.
4,18,9,ELAINE,"Yeah right, Salman Rushdie. Yeah well, I can see that - you got five millions Moslems after you, you wanna stay in pretty good shape."
4,18,10,GEORGE,I know what the problem is - I like her too much. That's why I can't make a move.
4,18,10,JERRY,You put her on a pedestal.
4,18,10,KRAMER,I put them on a dental chair.
4,18,10,JERRY,He puts 'em on a dental chair.
4,18,10,GEORGE,I'm not her boyfriend. I want to be her boyfriend.
4,18,10,KRAMER,Whoo. It's like a sauna in here.
4,18,10,GEORGE,That's funny. You're a funny guy.
4,18,10,JERRY,"Yeah, funny. Yeah, I never heard that before. So, you goin' to the funeral?"
4,18,10,GEORGE,"Why, you think I should?"
4,18,10,JERRY,"What, are you kidding? It's a golden opportunity to advance the relationship. She's crying, you put your arm around her and console her...you're the consolation guy!"
4,18,10,GEORGE,I'm the consolation guy...?
4,18,10,KRAMER,Consolation Guy is big.
4,18,10,JERRY,Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you.
4,18,10,KRAMER,It's like ten dates in one shot.
4,18,10,JERRY,This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The family's there...you're taking care of things...you're gettin' the sandwiches...you're the rock!
4,18,10,GEORGE,"It's in Detroit though, it's an expensive flight."
4,18,10,KRAMER,"Why don't you get a ""death in the family"" fare?"
4,18,10,GEORGE,What?
4,18,10,GEORGE,Really?
4,18,10,KRAMER,"In fact, listen...I'll go down there with ya. You know, we'll tell them there's a death in my family, you buy the ticket, I'll split it...then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll get to Detroit for a quarter of the price!"
4,18,12,ELAINE'S BRAIN,"Boy, I'm gettin' a good sweat here. Great sweat, good beads. Nice beads."
4,18,13,ELAINE'S BRAIN,"Ah, look who's here. ""Silicon Valley."""
4,18,13,SIDRA,"So anyway, we go out on one date, he asks me out for a second, then out of nowhere he cancels the date and says he doesn't want to see me again."
4,18,13,ELAINE,"Uh...sorry, I couldn't help overhearing."
4,18,13,SIDRA,"Oh, that's o.k."
4,18,13,ELAINE,Did he give you a reason?
4,18,13,SIDRA,Yeah. He's going back to his old girlfriend.
4,18,13,ELAINE,Really?
4,18,13,SIDRA,He said she's mentally ill. He's one of those guys who is obsessed with neatness and order? Everything has gotta be just so. He would have made a great Nazi.
4,18,13,ELAINE,"Hey, does he ever talk about Superman?"
4,18,13,SIDRA,Yes! How did you know?
4,18,13,ELAINE,"Oh, I know the type."
4,18,13,SIDRA,So you can relate?
4,18,13,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah."
4,18,13,SIDRA,"You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcy."
4,18,13,ELAINE,"Oh, hi. I'm Elaine."
4,18,15,ELAINE,"So anyway, I stood up to shake her hand, then suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her."
4,18,15,JERRY,You fell on her?
4,18,15,ELAINE,I touched 'em.
4,18,15,JERRY,You what?
4,18,15,ELAINE,I...touched...'em.
4,18,15,JERRY,You touched 'em?!
4,18,15,ELAINE,"I needed them to help me break my fall! If it hadn't been for them, I could have really injured myself!"
4,18,15,JERRY,Wow.
4,18,15,ELAINE,Anyway...they're real.
4,18,15,JERRY,Excuse me?!
4,18,15,ELAINE,I think they might be real.
4,18,15,JERRY,"Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience."
4,18,15,ELAINE,I've touched mine!
4,18,15,JERRY,So have I.
4,18,15,ELAINE,"Oh, right...I forgot."
4,18,15,JERRY,"Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert."
4,18,15,ELAINE,"Alright, well anyway, I think they're real. And if they are, I must say they are...spectacular."
4,18,15,JERRY,"Aw, what are you doin' to me?"
4,18,16,GEORGE,"You see, my friend here, his aunt passed away last night."
4,18,16,CLERK,"Oh, I'm very sorry."
4,18,16,KRAMER,"I saw her last week, she looked healthy and peaceful, but...she knew..."
4,18,16,CLERK,You poor thing!
4,18,16,GEORGE,"You don't think you can buy the ticket yourself...? No, there, there...you sit, and I'll purchase the ticket for you."
4,18,16,CLERK,You're a good friend.
4,18,16,CLERK,"Yes, all you have to do is pay the full fare now, then return to any one of our counters with a copy of the death certificate, and we'll refund half your fare."
4,18,16,GEORGE,The death certificate?
4,18,16,CLERK,"Yes, yes, we do need documentation or you know, people could take advantage."
4,18,16,GEORGE,What kind of a sick person would do a thing like that?
4,18,16,CLERK,I know! But it happens.
4,18,16,GEORGE,"You want my friend to ask his uncle, a man who just lost his wife of 44 years, for a death certificate so that he can save a few bucks on a flight?"
4,18,16,CLERK,That would be $387 round-trip.
4,18,16,KRAMER,"Alright, so you'll need my frequent flyer number, huh?"
4,18,16,CLERK,Yes.
4,18,17,JERRY,"I don't know, one minute you say they're fake, the next minute you think they're real...I don't know what to believe!"
4,18,17,ELAINE,"Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched 'em."
4,18,17,JERRY,"But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable?"
4,18,17,ELAINE,I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her!
4,18,17,JERRY,"Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere."
4,18,18,KRAMER,Hey!
4,18,18,JERRY,Hey. George off to Detroit?
4,18,18,KRAMER,"Yep! And, in two days, I'm off to Puerto Rico."
4,18,18,ELAINE,"Hey Kramer, by the way, I saw that guy at the health club...that is not Salman Rushdie."
4,18,18,KRAMER,Pffft - wrong.
4,18,19,JERRY,There's Sidra.
4,18,19,KRAMER,There's Salman.
4,18,19,JERRY,Where?
4,18,19,KRAMER,Talkin' to that woman.
4,18,19,JERRY,Talkin' to Sidra?
4,18,19,KRAMER,"If that's Sidra, she's talkin' to Salman."
4,18,19,JERRY,I don't think that's Salman.
4,18,19,KRAMER,"Well, I don't think they're real."
4,18,19,JERRY,"If that's Rushdie, they're real."
4,18,19,KRAMER,"If they're real, that's Rushdie."
4,18,19,JERRY,"Well, I gotta know - I'm talkin' to Sidra."
4,18,19,KRAMER,"I gotta know, I'm talkin' to Salman."
4,18,20,KRAMER,"It's like a sauna in here, huh? I feel like I'm...back at the desert."
4,18,20,"""SALMAN""",You've lived in the desert?
4,18,20,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've uh...I've spent a little time in the Mideast. You ever been to the Mideast?"
4,18,20,"""SALMAN""","Yes, I've been there."
4,18,20,KRAMER,My name's Kramer.
4,18,20,"""SALMAN""","Sal Bass. Pleased to meet you, Kramer."
4,18,20,KRAMER,"So, uh...what kind of work do you do?"
4,18,20,"""SALMAN""",I'm a writer.
4,18,21,BETSY,Have you met my boyfriend George?
4,18,21,AUNT MAY,No!
4,18,21,BETSY,"George, this is Aunt May, and Father Jessup. Oh, and that's my brother, Timmy. This is my boyfriend, George."
4,18,21,AUNT MAY,"Oh George, how nice of you to come all this way."
4,18,21,GEORGE,"Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise, what's the point of being the boyfriend? This is where you have to be when you're the boyfriend."
4,18,21,AUNT MAY,"Betsy, dear, have you had anything to eat?"
4,18,21,BETSY,I'm not very hungry.
4,18,21,AUNT MAY,They have some very nice snacks.
4,18,21,FATHER JESSUP,I'm about to get myself a snack.
4,18,22,GEORGE,"Oh, no, no, no...you sit right here...I will get you a nice snack."
4,18,23,FATHER JESSUP,This is my third wake this month. It never gets any easier.
4,18,23,GEORGE,"Well, losing a loved is, uh...I mean, forget about it."
4,18,23,FATHER JESSUP,"You seem to be of great comfort to Betsy, we're very appreciative."
4,18,23,GEORGE,"Oh - comfort, schmomfort. Listen, Father, can I ask you a question? In a terrible time like this...who would I get the death certificate from?"
4,18,24,KRAMER,C'mon Jerry!
4,18,24,JERRY,"Oh, how can you be so sure?"
4,18,24,KRAMER,"Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer. He said his name was Sal Bass. Bass, Jerry! Instead of salmon, he went with bass! He just substituted one fish for another!"
4,18,24,JERRY,"Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon!"
4,18,24,KRAMER,"Jerry, Jerry, you're missing the big picture!"
4,18,24,JERRY,"Alright, maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready - Sidra's coming over in a few minutes, so if you don't mind..."
4,18,24,KRAMER,"What, did you ask her?"
4,18,24,JERRY,I'm gonna find out tonight.
4,18,24,KRAMER,"Oh, yes indeed..."
4,18,25,DR. ALLENWOOD,Why do you need a death certificate?
4,18,25,GEORGE,"Well, Dr, Allenwood, uh...I was hoping to compile an - admittedly, rudimentary - scrapbook of her life. Something that Betsy could have, and hold onto."
4,18,25,DR. ALLENWOOD,"Well, I suppose I could make a copy of it."
4,18,25,GEORGE,"Oh, that would be wonderful."
4,18,25,DR. ALLENWOOD,"It was very nice meeting you, George."
4,18,25,GEORGE,Likewise.
4,18,26,TIMMY,What are you doing?
4,18,26,GEORGE,What?
4,18,26,TIMMY,Did...did you just double-dip that chip?
4,18,26,GEORGE,Excuse me?
4,18,26,TIMMY,You double-dipped the chip!
4,18,26,GEORGE,"""Double-dipped""? What are you talking about?"
4,18,26,TIMMY,You dipped the chip. You took a bite. And you dipped again.
4,18,26,GEORGE,So...?
4,18,26,TIMMY,"That's like putting your whole mouth right in the dip! From now on, when you take a chip - just take one dip and end it!"
4,18,26,GEORGE,"Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...but I don't dip that way."
4,18,26,TIMMY,"Oh, you don't, huh?"
4,18,26,GEORGE,No. You dip the way you want to dip... I'll dip the way I want to dip.
4,18,26,TIMMY,Gimme the chip! Gimme the chip!
4,18,27,SIDRA,"I don't know what I'm doing here, I must be crazy."
4,18,27,JERRY,"Hey, would you mind switching seats?"
4,18,27,SIDRA,Why?
4,18,27,JERRY,"Oh, I don't know...I just like sitting to the left of people, makes me feel like I'm driving."
4,18,27,JERRY,How ya doin'?
4,18,27,SIDRA,Good. How you doin'?
4,18,27,JERRY,"Good, feel good...you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts. Really big, huge...just coming out the top of her dress, they were like, chokin' her."
4,18,27,SIDRA,I hear that's how she died.
4,18,27,JERRY,"Have you noticed that women today are, you know, they seem...bigger."
4,18,27,SIDRA,"Well, a lot of women are having them done."
4,18,27,JERRY,Really?
4,18,27,SIDRA,Yeah.
4,18,27,JERRY,How do you like that.
4,18,27,SIDRA,A lot of people ask me if I've had mine done.
4,18,27,JERRY,"Aw, you know people."
4,18,27,SIDRA,"It gets a little tiring, it's really none of their business."
4,18,27,JERRY,"Oh, the nerve. You know, some people have asked me if you've uh, done that."
4,18,27,SIDRA,What do you tell them?
4,18,27,JERRY,Whatever you want me to tell them.
4,18,27,SIDRA,"Well, I think you'll find out soon enough. Aren't you going to get that?"
4,18,27,JERRY,No.
4,18,27,SIDRA,What if it's an emergency?
4,18,27,JERRY,"Oh, there's no emergency..."
4,18,27,KRAMER,"Jerry! C'mon, it's an emergency!"
4,18,27,JERRY,"Excuse me. Alright, what is it? You're interrupting!"
4,18,27,KRAMER,"Well, you know, I'm packing for Puerto Rico, I need to borrow your bathing suit."
4,18,27,JERRY,This is an emergency? You need a bathing suit?
4,18,27,KRAMER,"Well, I like yours."
4,18,27,JERRY,"I don't know, my bathing suit? That's a little familiar, I don't want your...your boys down there."
4,18,27,KRAMER,"C'mon, what's wrong with my boys?"
4,18,27,JERRY,Your boys should stay in their neighborhood.
4,18,27,KRAMER,"Alright, c'mon!"
4,18,27,JERRY,Alright. It's in the top drawer. Hurry up.
4,18,27,ELAINE,"Hi, Jer."
4,18,27,JERRY,"Oh, hi, Elaine."
4,18,27,ELAINE,"Oh...hi, Sidra -"
4,18,27,SIDRA,Hi...Elaine?
4,18,27,JERRY,What are you doing here?
4,18,27,ELAINE,I'm looking for Kramer.
4,18,27,KRAMER,"Yeah, she was just showing me pictures of places I can visit when I go to Puerto Rico...you know, when you two went down there?"
4,18,27,JERRY,"Oh. yeah. Alright. So, where were we?"
4,18,27,SIDRA,I was just leaving.
4,18,27,JERRY,"Right, you were leaving."
4,18,27,SIDRA,I can't believe you sent a woman into the sauna to do that.
4,18,27,JERRY,That was an accident!
4,18,27,SIDRA,"I think you're both mentally ill. And by the way...they're real, and they're spectacular."
4,18,28,BETSY,"Stop it, George! Get out! Get out! I never want to see you again!"
4,18,28,DR. ALLENWOOD,Go back to New York! Get out!
4,18,29,CLERK 2,"Alright sir, now all I need is a death certificate and you'll be on your way."
4,18,29,GEORGE,"Well, you see, what happened was...the doctor - the very same doctor that was attending to my late aunt - suffered an untimely stroke, and lost the use of his right hand, so...obviously I was unable to get the death certificate. However, I do have this."
4,18,29,CLERK 2,What's this?
4,18,29,GEORGE,That's a picture of me next to the coffin.
4,18,30,CLERK 2,Nice try.
4,18,30,GEORGE,"Not even close, huh?"
4,18,30,THE END,
