4,19,1,JERRY,You can't just *have* an adultery-- you *commit* adultery. And you
4,19,10,GEORGE,You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that?
4,19,10,JERRY,Produce section. *Very* provocative area. A lot of melons and
4,19,11,GEORGE,So when're you gonna see her?
4,19,11,JERRY,Tonight.
4,19,11,GEORGE,What's her name?
4,19,11,JERRY,
4,19,11,GEORGE,How could you not know her name?
4,19,11,JERRY,"I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do"
4,19,12,JERRY,Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for *one* day...
4,19,12,GEORGE,"Oh my God, I forgot to tell you. I got a letter today from the"
4,19,15,JERRY,"Yeah, I did that too."
4,19,15,GEORGE,"You remember the, the little bank book, there?"
4,19,15,JERRY,Sure.
4,19,15,GEORGE,"Alright, so I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade, I"
4,19,18,JERRY,Wow!
4,19,18,GEORGE,"Yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. You make money without"
4,19,19,JERRY,Y'know I have friends who try to base their whole life on that
4,19,20,GEORGE,Really? Who?
4,19,20,JERRY,Nobody you know...
4,19,20,GEORGE,Maybe I'll go down to the track. Put it all on a horse...
4,19,20,JERRY,Why don't you put it in the *bank*?
4,19,20,GEORGE,The *bank*? This is *found* money. I want to *parlay* it. I wanna
4,19,21,JERRY,"*Oh*, you mean you wanna *lose* it..."
4,19,21,GEORGE,What's with the gloves?
4,19,21,KRAMER,"Well, I'm staining my floors and, y'know, I don't want to get my"
4,19,22,GEORGE,"What, the whole apartment?"
4,19,22,KRAMER,The whole apartment. And I'm buying that fake wood wallpaper. I'm
4,19,24,JERRY,"What, you rented ""Home Alone""?"
4,19,24,GEORGE,Yeah.
4,19,24,JERRY,I thought you saw that already...
4,19,24,GEORGE,"No, I saw ""Home Alone II""."
4,19,24,JERRY,"Oh, right... But you *hated* it!"
4,19,24,GEORGE,"Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, do you"
4,19,25,JERRY,What for?
4,19,25,JERRY,Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not doing
4,19,27,KRAMER,I can't work with these!
4,19,27,JERRY,What's wrong?
4,19,27,KRAMER,"Well, you bought me dishwashing gloves. There's no *fine touch*..."
4,19,27,JERRY,"You said ""gloves""..."
4,19,27,KRAMER,"No, no, these are too thick."
4,19,27,KRAMER,"Oooh, is that ""Home Alone""?"
4,19,27,GEORGE,Yeah. The *original*.
4,19,27,ELAINE,Hey Boys-O!
4,19,27,ELAINE,"Remember Roy, the artist?"
4,19,27,JERRY,"Right, the ""triangle"" guy."
4,19,27,ELAINE,"Exactly, the ""triangle"" guy."
4,19,27,JERRY,"Yeah, you liked him. What happened with him?"
4,19,27,ELAINE,Yeah I did. He was very talented. He was just a little too...
4,19,27,JERRY,Artsy?
4,19,27,ELAINE,Fat.
4,19,27,JERRY,Oh.
4,19,27,ELAINE,"He was a fat, starving artist, y'know. That's very rare. Anyway,"
4,19,29,ELAINE,"Listen, Jerry can you do me a favour? Could you go into the room"
4,19,31,JERRY,"Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend."
4,19,31,ELAINE,Well...
4,19,31,JERRY,Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role before
4,19,32,ELAINE,What's with him?
4,19,32,JERRY,Y'know a lot of people have asked that...
4,19,32,ELAINE,Roy!
4,19,32,ROY,*Elaine*! What a *surprise*.
4,19,32,ELAINE,"Oh, my *God*! I hardly recognise you! You look so..."
4,19,32,ROY,I've lost some weight...
4,19,32,ELAINE,A *lot* of weight.
4,19,32,ROY,I know.
4,19,32,ELAINE,You look ter*rific*.
4,19,32,ROY,Thank you. So do you.
4,19,32,ELAINE,This is... uh... you *really* lost weight.
4,19,32,ROY,Thank you.
4,19,32,JERRY,"Jerry, uh, I'm the boyfriend."
4,19,32,WOMAN,Waaaaaaaaa!
4,19,32,KRAMER,"Ah, the mother lode!"
4,19,32,ELAINE,I can't believe it! You were *huge*! Like blubber! I couldn't
4,19,33,ROY,"Yes, I remember."
4,19,33,ELAINE,"Well that's the positive thing about getting sick, you get to lose"
4,19,34,ROY,"Elaine, it wasn't the illness. It was you."
4,19,34,ROY,"After you stopped seeing me, I was devastated. I couldn't eat for"
4,19,35,ELAINE,*Get* *out*!
4,19,35,ROY,"Really, it's the truth."
4,19,35,ELAINE,"Jerry, did you hear that? He couldn't eat for weeks..."
4,19,35,JERRY,That's terrible...
4,19,35,ELAINE,I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you.
4,19,35,ROY,You did.
4,19,35,JERRY,You know I can't get this damn thing to sleep...
4,19,35,ELAINE,"Now listen, tell me something. When are you gettin out of here?"
4,19,35,ROY,Next Thursday.
4,19,35,ELAINE,"Okay, I'll tell you what. How about on Friday I take you out for"
4,19,36,JERRY,Honey... Aren't we going to the Poconos next Friday?
4,19,36,ELAINE,No that's the week after.
4,19,36,JERRY,"No, I believe it's next week."
4,19,36,ELAINE,You're wrong.
4,19,36,JERRY,No I'm not...
4,19,36,ELAINE,Shut up...
4,19,36,KRAMER,Pay dirt!
4,19,36,ELAINE,"Uh Roy, this is Kramer-- he's one of our friends."
4,19,36,ROY,How do you do?
4,19,36,KRAMER,I do great.
4,19,36,DOCTOR,Hi Roy.
4,19,36,ROY,"Oh, hey Dr. Siegel."
4,19,36,JERRY,"Hey Doc, check this out. I *just*"
4,19,37,DOCTOR,I just wanted to stop by to see if you had any questions about
4,19,38,KRAMER,"Yeah, I have a question. What do you know about inter-abdominal"
4,19,39,DOCTOR,"Are you asking because you saw ""20/20"" last night?"
4,19,39,KRAMER,I sure am.
4,19,39,DOCTOR,Well that report was about *one* very specific type of retractor
4,19,41,KRAMER,But you *will* use... a retractor.
4,19,41,DOCTOR,We have to...
4,19,41,KRAMER,Mmm-hmm...
4,19,41,DOCTOR,Tell you what. You're obviously concerned about your friend's
4,19,44,KRAMER,"I'd love to watch the operation, yeah!"
4,19,44,JERRY,I dunno...
4,19,44,KRAMER,"Oh, come on Jerry. You gotta see the operation. They're gonna cut"
4,19,45,JERRY,"Yeah, that's true..."
4,19,45,KRAMER,...They'll saw through bone. (makes saw noises while gesturing over
4,19,46,JERRY,Hey.
4,19,46,GEORGE,Hi...
4,19,46,JERRY,"What are doing, you crying??"
4,19,46,GEORGE,No...
4,19,46,JERRY,"You crying from ""Home Alone""??"
4,19,46,GEORGE,The old man got to me.
4,19,46,JERRY,"Alright, just get yourself together... I dunno if I can be friends"
4,19,47,GEORGE,"Shut up! What are you doing back so soon, anyway?"
4,19,47,JERRY,"Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves and wanted"
4,19,48,GEORGE,How's the guy?
4,19,48,JERRY,"Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting pretty chummy."
4,19,49,GEORGE,That's nerve...
4,19,49,JERRY,"Yeah, so she and ""Triangle Boy"" can go out to fancy restaurants."
4,19,49,GEORGE,"Y'know what it is? It's ""Clara Nightingale Syndrome"". He falls"
4,19,50,JERRY,You mean Florence Nightingale.
4,19,50,GEORGE,What'd I say? Clara?
4,19,50,JERRY,"Yeah, you must have meant Clara Barton."
4,19,50,GEORGE,Clara Barton? What did she do?
4,19,50,JERRY,"I'm not sure, but I think she was nice."
4,19,50,GEORGE,Susan B. Anthony I think I'd have a problem with.
4,19,50,JERRY,"Yeah, I think you would."
4,19,50,GEORGE,"So, you gonna buy his art?"
4,19,50,JERRY,No. Why don't you buy it? You got 1 900 dollars.
4,19,50,GEORGE,"Yeah, that's what I want-- triangles. Alright, I'm outta here."
4,19,51,JERRY,I will.
4,19,51,GEORGE,"Y'know, now you gotta ask her her name. It's so embarrassing."
4,19,51,JERRY,"No, it isn't. I can find out."
4,19,51,GEORGE,Yeah? How?
4,19,51,JERRY,There are ways.
4,19,51,JERRY,"Y'know I remember when I was a kid growin up, kids would make fun"
4,19,53,WOMAN,"""Seinsmelled""?"
4,19,53,JERRY,Yeah. What about you? Did people make fun of your name?
4,19,53,WOMAN,Are you kidding? They were merciless! What do you expect when your
4,19,55,WOMAN,"Oh, Jerry..."
4,19,55,JERRY,Oh... *you*...
4,19,55,GEORGE,"Now let's try ""breast""... Celeste... Kest..."

4,19,55,JERRY,"""Hest""? That's not a name."
4,19,55,GEORGE,"What, you should've just asked her."
4,19,55,JERRY,"I know, I should've asked her."
4,19,55,GEORGE,What're you gonna do now?
4,19,55,JERRY,I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once
4,19,56,GEORGE,Aretha!
4,19,56,JERRY,No...
4,19,56,GEORGE,Bovary!
4,19,56,JERRY,"Alright, that's enough."
4,19,56,GEORGE,"Alright, well you know what you gotta do, you gotta go through her"
4,19,57,JERRY,How am I gonna do that?
4,19,57,GEORGE,When she goes to the bathroom.
4,19,57,KRAMER,"Ah, there you are. My date stood me up. Listen, will you guys"
4,19,58,JERRY,You asked a date to go to the operation?
4,19,58,KRAMER,"Yeah... So c'mon, what d'you say?"
4,19,58,GEORGE,What kind of operation is it?
4,19,58,KRAMER,Spleenectomy.
4,19,58,GEORGE,Isn't that where they remove the--
4,19,58,KRAMER,"Don't ruin it for me, I haven't seen it yet!"
4,19,58,KRAMER,"C'mon, what d'you say?"
4,19,58,GEORGE,Mulva!
4,19,58,JERRY,Mulva?
4,19,58,KRAMER,"C'mon, do you wanna go?"
4,19,58,JERRY,"Alright, alright. Just let me finish my coffee... then we'll go"
4,19,59,DOCTOR,"Now we'll open the peritoneal cavity, exposing the body's internal"
4,19,60,JERRY,What are you eating?
4,19,60,KRAMER,Junior Mints. Do you want one?
4,19,60,JERRY,No...
4,19,60,KRAMER,I can't see... Psst....
4,19,60,JERRY,Where'd you get those?
4,19,60,KRAMER,"The machine. You want one? Here, take one."
4,19,60,JERRY,I don't want any!
4,19,60,KRAMER,"No, they're good!"
4,19,60,JERRY,I don't want any!
4,19,60,KRAMER,Just take one.
4,19,60,JERRY,"No! Kramer, stop it!"
4,19,60,JERRY,"...Over the balcony, bounced off some respirator thing *into* the"
4,19,61,GEORGE,"What do you mean ""into the patient""?"
4,19,61,JERRY,"Into the patient, *literally*!"
4,19,61,GEORGE,Into the hole?
4,19,61,JERRY,"Yes, the hole!"
4,19,61,GEORGE,Didn't they notice it?
4,19,61,JERRY,No!
4,19,61,GEORGE,How could they not notice it?!?
4,19,61,JERRY,Because it's a little mint. It's a *Junior* Mint.
4,19,61,GEORGE,What did they do?
4,19,61,JERRY,They sealed him up with the mint inside.
4,19,61,GEORGE,They *left* the Junior Mint *in* him?
4,19,61,JERRY,Yes!
4,19,61,GEORGE,I guess it can't hurt him... People eat *pounds* of those things.
4,19,61,JERRY,"They *eat* them, they don't put them next to vital organs in their"
4,19,62,KRAMER,"Hey, this wallpaper is *very* good. My place looks like a ski"
4,19,63,JERRY,Why did you force that mint on me? I didn't want the mint!
4,19,63,KRAMER,"Well, I didn't believe you."
4,19,63,JERRY,How could you not believe me?!?
4,19,63,KRAMER,"Who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's"
4,19,64,JERRY,That's true.
4,19,64,KRAMER,It's very refreshing!
4,19,64,JERRY,"Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine..."
4,19,64,ELAINE,Prognosis... negative.
4,19,64,JERRY,Prognosis *negative*!?
4,19,64,ELAINE,"He's not doing well, the doctors don't know what it is. They're"
4,19,65,J+K,"Oh, my God..."
4,19,65,ELAINE,"Just my luck, y'know... just when he's getting thin and attractive."
4,19,67,GEORGE,It's that bleak?
4,19,67,ELAINE,Mmm...
4,19,67,GEORGE,"Y'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something..."
4,19,67,JERRY,We gotta confess.
4,19,67,KRAMER,Really?
4,19,67,JERRY,Yes!
4,19,67,KRAMER,We could be tried for murder...
4,19,67,JERRY,I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and Loeb!
4,19,67,KRAMER,"You're not gonna say anything, you got that?"
4,19,67,JERRY,I'm telling and you can't stop me!
4,19,67,KRAMER,You're *not*!!!
4,19,67,GEORGE,Hey Elaine? Put me down for some of that art. 1 900 dollars worth.
4,19,67,JERRY,"Oh yeah, that's the spot..."
4,19,67,WOMAN,What're you so tense about?
4,19,67,JERRY,"Oh, nothing really... Just a homicide. (She finds the right spot"
4,19,68,WOMAN,What?
4,19,68,JERRY,Mulva?
4,19,68,WOMAN,Mulva?
4,19,68,JERRY,My Aunt's name is Mulva. She's a masseuse.
4,19,68,WOMAN,I'm going to the bathroom. Be right back.
4,19,68,JERRY,"Oh, good idea..."
4,19,68,WOMAN,What are you doing?
4,19,68,JERRY,"Oh, I was just looking for some... gum or... mint."
4,19,68,WOMAN,"Oh, I have Junior Mints."
4,19,68,JERRY,"No! No, I mean, no thank you..."
4,19,68,KRAMER,Any news?
4,19,68,JERRY,"No, you better get out of here. No, wait a second..."
4,19,71,WOMAN,"Oh, hello."
4,19,71,KRAMER,"Hello, I'm Kramer."
4,19,71,WOMAN,Nice to meet you.
4,19,71,KRAMER,See you later.
4,19,71,WOMAN,"Well, I better get going. I don't want to be late for the play."
4,19,73,JERRY,"Hey, there's a name you don't forget."
4,19,73,WOMAN,"Oh, hi."
4,19,73,GEORGE,"Hi, I'm George."
4,19,73,WOMAN,"Nice to meet you, George."
4,19,73,GEORGE,"I gave it a shot... So, any word on the ""artiste""?"
4,19,73,JERRY,"No, I haven't heard anything."
4,19,73,GEORGE,"Well, I got my triangles."
4,19,73,JERRY,Really...
4,19,73,GEORGE,"Yup, y'know, they really spruce up the apartment."
4,19,73,JERRY,"Yeah, I'm sure..."
4,19,73,JERRY,"Well, I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened."
4,19,73,GEORGE,"No, Jerry. I wouldn't do that."
4,19,73,JERRY,Why?
4,19,73,GEORGE,You could get in trouble.
4,19,73,JERRY,"Look, I gotta try and help the guy."
4,19,73,GEORGE,Who are you to play God!? Every man's time comes! If his number
4,19,74,JERRY,Yes I'd like to speak to Dr. Siegel... it's about Roy Kordic's
4,19,75,GEORGE,What? What?
4,19,75,JERRY,"Oh, thats *fantastic*!"
4,19,75,GEORGE,"He didn't get better, did he?"
4,19,75,JERRY,Thank you very much. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay!
4,19,75,GEORGE,Where's the luck? There's no luck. 1 900 dollars down the drain.
4,19,75,ROY,"You saved my life, George. You buying my art is what inspired me"
4,19,76,GEORGE,"Oh, that's great. That's great."
4,19,76,KRAMER,"Y'know, art is a great investment."
4,19,76,ELAINE,"It's gonna look great in your apartment, George."
4,19,76,GEORGE,Yes I look forward to many years of looking at the triangles.
4,19,77,ROY,"Hey, George..."
4,19,77,DOCTOR,Y'know I don't want to totally discount the emotional element in
4,19,78,JERRY,What do you mean?
4,19,78,DOCTOR,"I have no medical evidence to back me up, but something happened"
4,19,80,KRAMER,Mint?
4,19,80,DOCTOR,Those can be very refreshing.
4,19,80,ROY,So Elaine... Where are we going for our big dinner on Friday?
4,19,80,ELAINE,"I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we're going to the Poconos on"
4,19,81,JERRY,I don't think so...
4,19,81,ELAINE,We are...
4,19,81,JERRY,I believe we're not...
4,19,81,ELAINE,Please can we go to
4,19,82,JERRY,"Well, I'll think about it..."
4,19,82,WOMAN,Great seats. You could see the actors spitting.
4,19,82,JERRY,Really...
4,19,82,WOMAN,And afterwards we went backstage and Olympia Dukakis autographed my
4,19,83,JERRY,"Oh, what're you saying, you got her autograph?"
4,19,83,WOMAN,Yeah.
4,19,83,JERRY,Do you have it with you?
4,19,83,WOMAN,"Yeah, it's in my purse."
4,19,83,JERRY,Let me see.
4,19,83,WOMAN,"Y'know I really think I'm falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld."
4,19,83,WOMAN,"Oh, well, I really think I'm falling for you..."
4,19,84,WOMAN,I had it autographed for my uncle.
4,19,84,JERRY,"Yeah, I know..."
4,19,84,WOMAN,"You don't know my name, do you?"
4,19,84,JERRY,Yes I do.
4,19,84,WOMAN,What is it?
4,19,84,JERRY,"It, uh, rhymes with a female body part."
4,19,84,WOMAN,What is it?
4,19,84,JERRY,Mulva...
4,19,84,JERRY,Gipple?
4,19,84,JERRY,Loleola?
4,19,84,JERRY,Oh! Oh! *Delores*!
4,19,84,JERRY,"Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing else."
