4,20,7,ELAINE,"What? What have I become? I haven't ""become"" anything..."
4,20,7,JERRY,"Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes?"
4,20,7,ELAINE,I don't want to keep him waiting...
4,20,7,JERRY,He'll like you more...
4,20,7,ELAINE,That's impossible...
4,20,7,WIFE,"Andrew, why do you have to pick your teeth at the table?"
4,20,7,HUSBAND,Leave me alone.

4,20,9,JERRY,What is it?
4,20,9,ELAINE,I think it's B.O.!
4,20,9,JERRY,What?
4,20,9,ELAINE,It's B.O. The *valet* must have had
4,20,9,JERRY,It *can't* be. Nobody has B.O. like this.
4,20,9,ELAINE,Jerry. It's *B*.*O*.
4,20,9,JERRY,But the whole car smells.
4,20,9,ELAINE,So?
4,20,9,JERRY,"So when somebody has B.O., the ""O"" usually stays with the ""B""."
4,20,10,ELAINE,I can't believe you ski!
4,20,10,CARL,I'm a great skier.
4,20,10,ELAINE,Yeah? What else?
4,20,10,CARL,"Let's see... I ski, I fish, I pillage, I plunder..."
4,20,10,ELAINE,"Oh! You ""pillage and plunder""?"

4,20,11,GEORGE,"Hey, whatd'ya know? Look at that! A *lesbian*"
4,20,13,GEORGE,"Oh, my God! It's Susan! What do I do?"

4,20,14,GEORGE,"Oh, hi..."
4,20,14,MONA,Pleasure to meet you.
4,20,14,GEORGE,Yes. Well...
4,20,14,MONA,"Well, I'll let you two, uh... catch up."
4,20,14,SUSAN,You okay?
4,20,14,GEORGE,Yeah. Yes! I just haven't seen you in a long time.
4,20,14,SUSAN,And you didn't expect me to be holding hands with a woman.
4,20,14,GEORGE,"Oh, *please*! Me? C'mon! That's *great*! Are you kidding? I"
4,20,16,SUSAN,I *know* who I'm talking to.
4,20,16,GEORGE,"Of course you do... It's just, uh, y'know, I-I never *knew*, uh,"
4,20,17,SUSAN,I liked women?
4,20,17,GEORGE,There you go.
4,20,17,GEORGE,"So, uh, how long has this been going on?"
4,20,17,SUSAN,Since you and I broke up.
4,20,17,GEORGE,"Ssssso, after me, you... went that way?"
4,20,17,SUSAN,Yeah.
4,20,17,GEORGE,"Oh, I think that's fantastic. Good for you. Nice. That's very"
4,20,18,SUSAN,"So, what have you got there?"
4,20,18,GEORGE,"Oh, I, uh--"
4,20,18,SUSAN,"Oh, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''"
4,20,18,GEORGE,"It's a foreign movie... a *film*, is what it is, actually."
4,20,18,SUSAN,"Yeah... A lot of nudity in that, huh?"
4,20,18,GEORGE,"No, no, no... Just a *tiny* bit... It's not even *frontal* nudity."
4,20,19,CLERK,Next.
4,20,19,GEORGE,"Oh, that's me."
4,20,19,SUSAN,"Alright, well... Good seeing you, George."
4,20,19,GEORGE,"Yes, good to see you, too. And Good luck with, uh... with the"
4,20,20,CLERK,"Uh, what are you returning?"
4,20,20,GEORGE,"``Rochelle, Rochelle''."
4,20,20,CLERK,"Ah, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''... ""A young girl's strange, erotic"
4,20,21,CLERK,"Uh, that'll be, uh... $3.49."
4,20,21,GEORGE,$3.49? It says $1.49.
4,20,21,CLERK,"Well, you didn't rewind it. There's a $2.00 charge for not"
4,20,22,GEORGE,What! There's no signs here! This is an outrage!
4,20,22,KRAMER,"George, don't give him any money for that. It'll cost you less to"
4,20,24,GEORGE,I'm not giving you the satisfaction. I'm gonna watch it again...
4,20,24,JERRY,"So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out. I"
4,20,28,ELAINE,Y'know I can think of at *least* six known offensive odours that
4,20,29,JERRY,What about skunk?
4,20,29,ELAINE,I don't mind skunk.
4,20,29,JERRY,Horse manure?
4,20,29,ELAINE,I *loooove* horse manure.
4,20,29,JERRY,"Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I"
4,20,33,ELAINE,Absolutely.
4,20,33,ELAINE,"Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy, and he"
4,20,34,JERRY,It means he's lying.
4,20,34,ELAINE,Wow...
4,20,34,JERRY,Why? Is that what he told you?
4,20,34,ELAINE,"Yeah, last night. Oh, come on... Men *have* to get up early some"
4,20,35,JERRY,No. Never.
4,20,35,ELAINE,Jerry! I'm *sure* I've seen men on the street early in the morning.
4,20,35,JERRY,"Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will"
4,20,36,ELAINE,Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?
4,20,36,JERRY,Anything's *possible*...
4,20,36,JERRY,What's the matter with you?
4,20,36,KRAMER,Steinbrenner! He's ruinin' my life...
4,20,36,JERRY,"Oh yeah, Steinbrenner..."
4,20,36,KRAMER,"I don't think I can take another season with him, Jerry. He'll"
4,20,38,JERRY,I know the list...
4,20,38,KRAMER,What's that smell?
4,20,38,JERRY,What smell?
4,20,38,KRAMER,Ooooh... You stink.
4,20,38,JERRY,Whatd'ya mean I stink?
4,20,38,KRAMER,You *stink*. Why don't you go take a shower?
4,20,38,JERRY,"I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've been in"
4,20,39,ELAINE,So?
4,20,39,JERRY,Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me!
4,20,40,ELAINE,"If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's why Carl"
4,20,42,KRAMER,What happened?
4,20,42,JERRY,What happened? My car *stinks* is what happened. And it's
4,20,43,GEORGE,What is that? B.O.?
4,20,43,JERRY,Yeah.
4,20,43,GEORGE,This is *unbelievable* B.O.
4,20,43,JERRY,I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me
4,20,45,GEORGE,"So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this?"
4,20,45,JERRY,"No, no. It's the valet guy."
4,20,45,GEORGE,"No, no, I mean, driving Susan to lesbianism."
4,20,45,JERRY,"Oh... No, that's ridiculous."
4,20,45,GEORGE,What if her experience with me *drove* her to it?
4,20,45,JERRY,"Suicide, maybe, not lesbianism."
4,20,45,GEORGE,"The woman she's ""lesbianing"" with? Susan told me she's *never*"
4,20,46,GEORGE,"Oh, this isn't even B.O.! This is *beyond* B.O.! It's *B*.B.O.!"
4,20,46,JERRY,"There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a ""Smell"
4,20,48,GEORGE,"Y'know, the funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing"
4,20,50,JERRY,Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought...
4,20,50,JERRY,Here he is... that's the guy!
4,20,51,RESTAURATEUR,"What do you mean-- ""stunk up""?"
4,20,51,JERRY,"I mean the car *stinks*! George, does the car stink?"
4,20,51,GEORGE,Stinks.
4,20,51,JERRY,Stinks!
4,20,51,RESTAURATEUR,"Well, perhaps *you're* the one who has the odour..."
4,20,51,JERRY,"Hey, I've never smelled in my *life*, buddy!"
4,20,51,RESTAURATEUR,"Really? Well, I smell you now."
4,20,51,JERRY,That's from the car!
4,20,51,RESTAURATEUR,"Well, maybe *you're* the one who stunk up the car, rather"
4,20,52,GEORGE,"Oh, it's the chicken and the egg..."
4,20,52,JERRY,"Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car;"
4,20,53,RESTAURATEUR,I don't have time to smell cars.
4,20,53,GEORGE,Forget about smelling the car. Smell the valet. Go to the
4,20,54,JERRY,You've gotta smell the car
4,20,54,RESTAURATEUR,I'm a busy man
4,20,54,JERRY,C'mon! One whiff!
4,20,54,RESTAURATEUR,"Alright, one whiff..."
4,20,54,RESTAURATEUR,Alright! I give up! I admit it! It stinks! Now will you
4,20,55,JERRY,"Alright, will you pay for the cleaning?"
4,20,55,RESTAURATEUR,Yes! 50 dollars! I'll give you 50 dollars!
4,20,55,RESTAURATEUR,I'm not paying for *that*. They've already got my seven
4,20,57,CARL,The valet had such bad B.O.?
4,20,59,CARL,That's a relief...
4,20,59,ELAINE,What?
4,20,59,CARL,It's still there...
4,20,59,ELAINE,"No, no, no! It *can't* be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated!"
4,20,59,GEORGE,"Listen, I gotta ask you: I was a little concerned that perhaps I"
4,20,60,CLERK,That'll be $98.00.
4,20,60,GEORGE,What $98.00?
4,20,60,CLERK,That's what I said. $98.00.
4,20,60,GEORGE,How could that piece of *crap* cost
4,20,60,GEORGE,"So, was it me?"
4,20,60,SUSAN,"Oh, don't be ridiculous! Is that what you wanted to talk to me"
4,20,61,GEORGE,"Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back."
4,20,61,SUSAN,"Yeah, *sure*... I gotta go."
4,20,61,GEORGE,Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever
4,20,63,SUSAN,You're an idiot.
4,20,63,GEORGE,Why? That's a *legitimate* sociological question.
4,20,63,SUSAN,"I'll see ya. And George, by the way... You stink... Real bad."
4,20,63,GEORGE,It's not me! It's the car!
4,20,63,MONA,I didn't think I'd come.
4,20,63,KRAMER,I knew you would.
4,20,63,MONA,"Oh, Kramer!"
4,20,63,CAR WASHER,"We spray everything with Ozium-D, let it de-ionise, vacuum the"
4,20,67,JERRY,Let's do it.
4,20,67,HAIRDRESSER,The first thing we're gonna do is flush the follicles with the
4,20,72,ELAINE,Tomato Sauce?
4,20,72,JERRY,Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!
4,20,72,CARL,It still smells.
4,20,72,JERRY,It still smells!
4,20,72,GEORGE,How could it still smell after all that?
4,20,72,JERRY,I don't know!
4,20,72,GEORGE,"Well, what are you gonna do?"
4,20,72,JERRY,"I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!"
4,20,72,GEORGE,You're *selling* the car!?
4,20,72,JERRY,You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more
4,20,75,GEORGE,Maybe I'll buy it.
4,20,75,JERRY,Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This
4,20,76,ELAINE,I still smell!
4,20,76,JERRY,You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's
4,20,77,SUSAN,"Kramer! Kramer! Kramer, open up, I know you're in there!"
4,20,77,JERRY,Susan!
4,20,77,SUSAN,Kramer!
4,20,77,JERRY,What is going on?
4,20,77,SUSAN,"You know what's going on? First, he vomits on me. Then, he burns"
4,20,78,GEORGE,He stole your girlfriend?
4,20,78,SUSAN,Yes. She's in *love* with him.
4,20,78,GEORGE,"Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back."
4,20,78,JERRY,That's the *least* of what you've accomplished...
4,20,78,ELAINE,"Wait a minute, wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer... Hold on a second."
4,20,80,KRAMER,I'm Kramer.
4,20,80,GEORGE,I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what they want?
4,20,80,SUSAN,I just don't know what she sees in *Kramer*.
4,20,80,GEORGE,Listen. You're beautiful. You're intelligent. You'll meet other
4,20,81,SUSAN,You think so?
4,20,81,GEORGE,"Yes, I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian."
4,20,81,SUSAN,You're very sweet...
4,20,81,GEORGE,"Hey, I know what I'm talking about. I gotta be honest with you, I"
4,20,83,SUSAN,Really?
4,20,83,GEORGE,"Yeah, you're just so... hip."
4,20,83,GEORGE,"Oh, my God..."
4,20,83,SUSAN,What?
4,20,83,GEORGE,It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed with me.
4,20,83,ALLISON,George?
4,20,83,GEORGE,"Allison! Hi! Oh, my God! How are you?"
4,20,83,ALLISON,"Good. You know, you owe me $50..."
4,20,83,GEORGE,"Right. I don't have it on me. Allison, this is Susan. Susan,"
4,20,84,ALLISON,Nice to meet you...
4,20,84,SUSAN,Nice to meet you...
4,20,84,ALLISON,That's a beautiful vest...
4,20,84,SUSAN,Thank you...
4,20,84,KRAMER,I don't understand it. I was with her last night in my apartment;
4,20,86,SALESMAN,What year did you say this was?
4,20,86,KRAMER,"Anyway, we were on the couch, I move to hug her, next thing she"
4,20,87,JERRY,That's strange...
4,20,87,SALESMAN,How many miles you got on this thing?
4,20,87,KRAMER,"And I was looking good, too. I had a nice, new shirt on, I'm"
4,20,88,JERRY,Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast!
4,20,88,SALESMAN,I can't sell this car.
4,20,88,HAIRDRESSER,"So, what do you want to do?"
4,20,88,ELAINE,Sauce me.
4,20,88,JERRY,Why do we need B.O.? What is the function of it? Everything in
