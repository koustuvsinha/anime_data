4,23,0,THE PILOT PART 2,Written by Larry David
4,23,2,TOM,What do you mean made up?
4,23,2,JERRY,It's made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. It's not Danish.
4,23,2,TOM,You're crazy.
4,23,2,JERRY,No I'm not. George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish?
4,23,2,MICHAEL,What do you mean Danish?
4,23,2,GEORGE,This guy stinks.
4,23,2,JERRY,Danish. Is it from Denmark?
4,23,2,MICHAEL,"No, they make it in New Jersey. It's just a Danishy name."
4,23,2,TOM,I can't believe that. They fooled *me* Jerry.
4,23,2,RITA,"Boy, talk about a show about nothing."
4,23,2,GEORGE,"Uh, excuse me. Excuse me. This--This is not right. May I? You see, you're going: ""They fooled *me* Jerry!"" You wanna hit 'fooled' more: ""They *fooled* me Jerry!"". You see the difference?"
4,23,2,TOM,I'm not gonna say it like that.
4,23,2,GEORGE,Just a suggestion.
4,23,2,YELLING GUY,"All right everybody, take a five."
4,23,2,GEORGE,Yep. That's five!
4,23,2,JERRY,"George? I don't have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. But from what I can gather, they're a little touchy about being told how to say the lines."
4,23,2,GEORGE,Why is that?
4,23,2,JERRY,"I don't know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing?"
4,23,2,GEORGE,"Oh, you're fine... you're fine. So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?"
4,23,2,JERRY,Why would he steal a box of raisins?
4,23,2,GEORGE,"Yeah, it's bizarre."
4,23,3,RITA,What's with him? Russell? Russell?
4,23,3,RUSSELL,What?
4,23,3,RITA,You O.K.?
4,23,3,RUSSELL,"Yeah. No, uh, I was just thinking of something. I'll be back in a second."
4,23,4,SANDI,What's the matter?
4,23,4,JERRY,Nothing.
4,23,4,SANDI,You're acting weird. Is anything wrong?
4,23,4,JERRY,No.
4,23,4,SANDI,Are you breaking up with me?
4,23,4,JERRY,Are we going out?
4,23,4,SANDI,"You're breaking up with me, aren't you?"
4,23,4,JERRY,Do you want me to break up with you?
4,23,4,SANDI,If that's what you want.
4,23,4,JERRY,I don't even know what you're talking about.
4,23,4,SANDI,Fine. Break up with me.
4,23,4,JERRY,All right. We're broken up.
4,23,4,SANDI,Can we still be friends?
4,23,5,GEORGE,Remember when you came to audition for us?
4,23,5,TOM,Yeah.
4,23,5,GEORGE,"There was a box of raisins on the coffee table. Did you, by any chance, take them with you when left?"
4,23,5,TOM,What are you talking about?
4,23,5,GEORGE,"Well we were all eating the raisins. And I remember you--you were eating some of the raisins. And then you left, and the raisins were gone. And I was just wondering if, you know , maybe you took them with you."
4,23,5,TOM,Are you accusing me of stealing the raisins?
4,23,5,GEORGE,"Oh, no, no--"
4,23,5,TOM,Why would I steal a box of raisins!?
4,23,5,GEORGE,"No you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's just that... they were missing, and... well I'm just inquiring."
4,23,5,TOM,"Let me give you a word of advice. O.K.? I want you to stay away from me. I don't wanna talk to you, and I don't wanna hear anymore of your stupid little notes and suggestions. I don't like you. So if you got any other problems whether it's raisins, prunes, figs, or any other dried fruit, just keep it to yourself and stay out of my way, O.K.?"
4,23,5,GEORGE,Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right. I don't think we're gonna have any problem with that. Good talking to you Tom. Really.
4,23,6,RUSSELL,"Elaine. Elaine. What do you want? What can I do? Is it my job? Is that what it is? Elaine I can't go on like this. Will you call me? Would you call me? Well, why? All right. May I call you? Elaine? Elaine?"
4,23,6,DAVID,Excuse me Mr. Dalrimple. I am so sorry.
4,23,6,RUSSELL,All right. All right. What's your name?
4,23,6,DAVID,David Richardson.
4,23,6,RUSSELL,Get out! You're fired!
4,23,6,DAVID,But Mr. Dalrimple--
4,23,6,RUSSELL,"Don't talk back to me. Didn't you hear what I say? Get out! You want me to call the cops? I make and break little worms like you every day. Do you know how much money I make? Do you have any idea! Do you know where I live? I can have any woman in this city that I want. Any one. Now, GET OUT! What are you all looking at? Go back to work! BACK! NOW!"
4,23,8,GEORGE,The doc called and said the lab's backed up and now I'm not gonna get the results for another two days.
4,23,8,JERRY,Ah! You're fine. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the one who's dying.
4,23,8,GEORGE,What do you mean?
4,23,8,JERRY,Because I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing!
4,23,8,GEORGE,Come on you're... uh... you're fine.
4,23,8,JERRY,This show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved in this.
4,23,8,GEORGE,What about me? I was a total failure. Everything was fine. Now this thing's gonna be a success and God's gonna give me a terminal disease.
4,23,8,JERRY,"This actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind."
4,23,8,GEORGE,The guy playing Kramer threatened me.
4,23,8,JERRY,Why?
4,23,8,GEORGE,'cause I asked him about the raisins.
4,23,8,JERRY,You mentioned the raisins.
4,23,8,GEORGE,Oh yeah.
4,23,8,JERRY,Did he take 'em?
4,23,8,GEORGE,I don't know.
4,23,8,JERRY,"Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?"
4,23,8,GEORGE,That's what I'm trying to find out.
4,23,9,JERRY,Hey.
4,23,9,KRAMER,Hey.
4,23,9,JERRY,Any luck?
4,23,9,KRAMER,"No. No, nothing. I got no... peristalsis."
4,23,9,JERRY,What about bran?
4,23,9,JERRY,"Well my friend, it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus."
4,23,9,KRAMER,"Pfft! Hold it right there. If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, you're wasting your time. I am not Jerry, under any circumstances, doing any inserting in that area."
4,23,9,JERRY,"Oh, it's not that bad!"
4,23,9,GEORGE,Yes it is.
4,23,10,ELAINE,Well it's all taken care of. I filed a report. An investigation is underway.
4,23,10,JERRY,"So, you going to the taping tomorrow night?"
4,23,10,ELAINE,No. I don't think I should go. I really don't wanna bump into Russell. He called me the other day. He won't quit.
4,23,10,JERRY,"Oh, come on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you."
4,23,10,ELAINE,"Jerry, this is not a crush. This is a complete fixation. he makes me very uncomfortable."
4,23,10,JERRY,We need you there!
4,23,10,ELAINE,Hey are you gonna go?
4,23,10,KRAMER,No. No. I'm gonna stay home. I want to be close to my home base in case there's any news from the front.
4,23,22,SANDI,No! Pick it up more in the front! It's got to be higher! Higher! Make a wall! A wall!
4,23,22,ASSISTANT DRESSER,"Sandi, are you in wardrobe? Sandi?"
4,23,22,JERRY,Try Elaine.
4,23,22,ASSISTANT DRESSER,Elaine?
4,23,22,SANDI,Yes?
4,23,23,WILTON,Elaine? It's me-- Wilton Marshall. Remember? Camp Tioga-- 1978? Remember?
4,23,23,ELAINE,"Oh, right."
4,23,23,WILTON,Wow! You know you haven't changed a bit.
4,23,24,MICHAEL,I can't remember my lines!!!
4,23,24,JERRY,"Just relax, you'll be fine."
4,23,24,MICHAEL,I can't relax. I don't know what line! I don't know any of 'em!
4,23,24,JERRY,You're just like George. George'd do the same thing. You're just like him. It's amazing!
4,23,24,MICHAEL,Help me Jerry! Help me!
4,23,25,RITA,Where is Russell?
4,23,25,STU,You know I don't know. I thought he was coming. I assumed he wouldn't miss it.
4,23,25,JAY,He hasn't been well.
4,23,25,STU,Can I tell you something in confidence? I think it's a woman.
4,23,25,RITA,How pathetic.
4,23,26,GEORGE,"This is George Costanza, I'm calling for my test results. Negative? Oh, my God. WHY! WHY! WHY? What? What? Negative is good? Oh, yes of course! How stupid of me. Thank you. Thank you very much."
4,23,29,GEORGE,"Listen. I know we've had our problems in the past, but we got a show to do tonight. Time to pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say, let's let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins-- They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins. We'll have a nice laugh."
4,23,29,TOM,"How would you like it if I just pulled your heart out of your chest right now, and shoved it down your throat?"
4,23,30,PAT HAZELL,Are you ready to meet our cast? All right.
4,23,32,JERRY,"Good evening, folks. How you doing? Well, you sound like a great crowd. We have a show we're gonna put on for you tonight. It's a new TV show. It's what they call a pilot. And we hope it becomes a series. It's called 'Jerry', and I'm playing Jerry--"
4,23,32,JOE DEVOLA,
4,23,34,GEORGE,"Sic semper tyrannis? What is that, Latin?"
4,23,34,JERRY,"Yeah, it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln."
4,23,34,GEORGE,Really? What does it mean?
4,23,34,JERRY,"It means: ""Death to tyrants""."
4,23,34,GEORGE,I can see that.
4,23,35,ELAINE,"See, now this is exciting! This is exciting! Did I miss anything already?"
4,23,35,JERRY,"No, it starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping, what's the big deal?"
4,23,35,ELAINE,"Nah, now it's on TV. It's different. I told everybody I know to watch it."
4,23,35,GEORGE,"Yeah, me too."
4,23,35,JERRY,"Hey, what about Russell? Did you hear from him?"
4,23,35,ELAINE,No.
4,23,35,JERRY,Strange. Even not showing up at the taping...
4,23,36,KRAMER,"Hey, pistol-packin mama, you swing that gal around, Allemande left with the old gray hag, around and around you go. Yee-ha!!"
4,23,36,JERRY,"Well, well, well."
4,23,36,ELAINE,Congratulations.
4,23,36,KRAMER,"Well, thank you."
4,23,36,GEORGE,"You went for the big ""E""."
4,23,36,KRAMER,Wet and wild.
4,23,36,JERRY,All right. Come on sit down. It's about to start.
4,23,36,KRAMER,"Oh, yes."
4,23,37,ELAINE,"Hey, what's this? Look. A wallet."
4,23,37,JERRY,A wallet? Let me see that.
4,23,37,ELAINE,Here.
4,23,37,JERRY,"Ah, man! It's my father's wallet! The one he thought they stole at the doctor's office that time."
4,23,37,GEORGE,Shh! This is it!
4,23,37,JERRY,How do you like that?
4,23,43,ELAINE,Bravo!
4,23,44,GEORGE,You hurt me.
4,23,45,MICHAEL,Hey.
4,23,45,JERRY,Hey George.
4,23,45,MICHAEL,New sneakers?
4,23,45,JERRY,Yeah.
4,23,45,MICHAEL,What do you need new sneakers for?
4,23,45,JERRY,I like sneakers.
4,23,45,MICHAEL,How do you make a decision which one to wear? I'd go crazy if I have to decide which sneakers to wear every day.
4,23,45,JERRY,"Nah, you're crazy anyway."
4,23,47,SUSAN AND ALLSION,George!
4,23,48,SID,What kind of stupid show is this? Hey! It's that idiot that took all my records!
4,23,49,MARLA,"John, what are you doing? Come back to bed."
4,23,49,JOHN,This show looks interesting. Isn't he that Seinfeld fellow you went out with?
4,23,49,MARLA,"Ooh, he's horrible! Horrible!"
4,23,49,JOHN,Nevertheless...
4,23,50,THE DRAKE,"Ah, that Jerry's a funny guy. Huh? Got to love the Sein!"
4,23,50,ALLSION,Hate the Sein!
4,23,51,PING,I can't believe you liked him.
4,23,51,CHERYL,I thought he was dark and disturbed.
4,23,51,PING,Real perceptive.
4,23,52,DONALD,This is a piece of crap!
4,23,52,MOTHER,"Donald, you used to like him."
4,23,52,DONALD,What a sellout! Give me that remote!
4,23,52,MEL,"No, Donald."
4,23,55,KRAMER,"Come on Jerry, the commercials almost over."
4,23,55,JERRY,All right.
4,23,55,ELAINE,You know Jerry I really like this guy who's playing the butler.
4,23,55,JERRY,Oh yeah. He's good. You know he's John Ritter's cousin.
4,23,55,ELAINE,Really?
4,23,55,JERRY,Yeah.
4,23,56,JERRY,"Hello, Charles."
4,23,56,CHARLES,"Hello. So, where do you want me to start today?"
4,23,56,JERRY,Why don't you start in the bedroom?
4,23,56,CHARLES,Start in the bedroom...
4,23,57,TOM,Hey.
4,23,57,JERRY,Hey. The butler's here.
4,23,57,TOM,"He is? Listen. When he's finished, send him over to my house."
4,23,57,JERRY,I'm not sending him to your house.
4,23,57,TOM,Why not?
4,23,57,JERRY,"Because the judge decreed he'd become my butler, not my friend's butler."
4,23,57,TOM,"Jerry, he is your butler. You can give him any order you want. That's what butlers do."
4,23,57,JERRY,But I don't want to.
4,23,57,KRAMER,"Jerry, my house is a pigsty, come on."
4,23,58,JERRY,Yeah?
4,23,58,SANDI,It's Elaine.
4,23,58,JERRY,Come on up.
4,23,59,CHARLES,I need more Pledge.
4,23,59,JERRY,More Pledge! I just bought two cans last week and I don't even have any wood in the house!
4,23,59,CHARLES,"Well, it goes fast."
4,23,60,SANDI,Hello.
4,23,60,CHARLES,Hello.
4,23,60,JERRY,What's all this about?
4,23,60,SANDI,We had a date.
4,23,60,JERRY,You had a date? You went out with my butler? Who said you could go out with my butler?
4,23,60,SANDI,Why do I need your permission?
4,23,60,JERRY,Because he's my butler!
4,23,62,MORTY,That's terrific!
4,23,62,HELEN,How could anyone not like him?
4,23,63,C.K.,I like his style. He has a sort of casual elegance.
4,23,63,TIA,But he picks his nose.
4,23,63,C.K.,Nevertheless...
4,23,64,SAL BASS,He's a member of our health club. Isn't he?
4,23,64,SIDRA,Yeah...
4,23,64,SAL BASS,You know that Kim Novak has some big breasts?
4,23,66,JERRY,Ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves?
4,23,67,JERRY,"You know I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out his future, wouldn't you say? Not much chance is gonna be a hitman I think after that. ""Terribly sorry Sir, but I'm going to have to whack you""."
4,23,69,ALL,Wooh! Yeah!
4,23,69,ELAINE,Wow! That was great! That show was so funny. It was really funny. I'm not just saying that cause I know you. Honestly.
4,23,69,JERRY,Let's go out and celebrate!
4,23,69,ELAINE,That was so good.
4,23,69,JERRY,Come on let's eat something.
4,23,69,ELAINE,You know what I think this thing is gonna get picked up George. You guys are gonna be rich!
4,23,69,GEORGE,Do you really think so?
4,23,69,ELAINE,Oh yeah.
4,23,69,GEORGE,And God didn't kill me.
4,23,69,JERRY,Hello?
4,23,69,RITA,"Hi Jerry, this is Rita Kierson."
4,23,69,JERRY,"Oh, hi Rita."
4,23,69,RITA,I'm calling to let you know that Russell Dalrimple is no longer with this network.
4,23,69,JERRY,"Oh, my God. Did he get fired?"
4,23,69,RITA,To be honest with you. Nobody really knows. He seems to have disappeared.
4,23,69,JERRY,Russell's disappeared?
4,23,69,RITA,"In any event, I've been made the new president of NBC. As you may or may not know, Russell and I did not see eye to eye on many, many projects. And as my first order of business, I'm, uh, passing on your show."
4,23,69,JERRY,You're passing already? But the show just ended two minutes ago!
4,23,69,RITA,"Well, I just got the job. Goodbye, Jerry."
4,23,69,JERRY,"Yeah, see ya."
4,23,70,ELAINE,What-- What are you looking at me for?
4,23,70,GEORGE,It was you!
4,23,70,ELAINE,What did I do?
4,23,70,JERRY,Do you realize his obsession with you cost us a TV series?
4,23,70,ELAINE,"I didn't know that he'd fall for me and I'd drive him insane. I mean, you know, that's not my fault."
4,23,70,GEORGE,Yes it is! You're very charming!
4,23,70,ELAINE,I can't believe this? What happened to him? Where the hell is he?
4,23,70,JERRY,No one knows.
4,23,73,RUSSELL,"She works for Pendant Publishing. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. You know, I used to work for NBC, but when I go back to her this time, she'll respect me."
4,23,73,MAN ON RAFT,You'd better get down. They might start firing soon.
4,23,76,JERRY,Hey look at this. What is going on here?
4,23,76,GEORGE,"Well, well, well."
4,23,76,ELAINE,"Nothing has changed. How did this happen? Ah, these are the two guys I talked to at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Hey! What are you two guys doing here? I thought you were gonna do something about this. Now you're eating here?"
4,23,76,FRED,Oh no. That's why we're here. We're checking things out.
4,23,76,PAUL,"Yeah, we're checking it out."
4,23,76,ELAINE,You're checking it out?
4,23,77,MAN,"See you back at the office, guys."
4,23,77,MR. VISAKI,"Fred, Paul, lunch and dinner? Boy, you guys ought to move in. How about a piece of pie on me? Sophia! Take care of these fellows."
4,23,77,ELAINE,Hey! Come here a second. I want you to know something. You are not gonna get away with this!
4,23,77,MR. VISAKI,Get away with what?
4,23,77,ELAINE,"Ah, ""with what?"" You know what. With the waitresses. How they're all... alike."
4,23,77,MR. VISAKI,Of course they're alike. They're my daughters.
4,23,78,ELAINE,"Oh, your daughters."
4,23,78,GEORGE,"You must be very proud Mr. Visaki. And may I say sir they're lovely girls, absolutely lovely girls. It's nice to see such fine upstanding women in gainful employment, Mr. Visaki."
4,23,78,MR. VISAKI,"Oh, here's a table for you."
4,23,78,GEORGE,A table right here.
4,23,78,MR. VISAKI,Peggy!
4,23,78,GEORGE,Peggy! His daughter Peggy. Peggy's coming over to serve.
4,23,78,JERRY,What a family!
4,23,78,MR. VISAKI,My daughter Peggy.
4,23,78,GEORGE,Ah! Peggy. Good to see you.
4,23,78,ELAINE,Hi Peggy.
4,23,78,GEORGE,Thank you very much. So guess what I got do tomorrow?
4,23,78,JERRY,What?
4,23,78,GEORGE,Start looking for a job.
4,23,78,KRAMER,You know what you ought to do George? You should work for Greenpeace. You those people they attack the whalers out on the open sea.
4,23,78,GEORGE,Are you crazy? You take your life in your hands with those nuts.
4,23,81,MAN,"Keep fighting matey! Get your head above the water! I've got you matey! I've got you! Matey! I'll remember her name! Elaine Benes! I'll write to her. I'll tell her all about you and what you did out here! Goodbye, matey! Goddbye!"
4,23,82,THE END,
