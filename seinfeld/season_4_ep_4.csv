4,4,0,THE WALLET,Written by Larry David
4,4,3,JERRY,George and I went up to NBC and we told them our idea for a series now we're just waiting to sign the contract.
4,4,3,HELEN,And they liked your idea?
4,4,3,JERRY,Yeah.
4,4,3,MORTY,What'ya got leather seats here?
4,4,3,HELEN,Since when is George a writer?
4,4,3,JERRY,What writer? It's a sitcom.
4,4,3,HELEN,That's exciting. When are you going to sign the contract?
4,4,3,JERRY,"Soon, there's a couple of problems."
4,4,3,MORTY,"Jerry, I wanna tell you that meal was the worst."
4,4,3,JERRY,What do you expect? It's airline food.
4,4,3,MORTY,. . . give you fish.
4,4,3,JERRY,How could you eat fish on a plane?
4,4,3,MORTY,because she puts up such a big stink every time I have a piece of meat.
4,4,3,HELEN,What kind of problems?
4,4,3,JERRY,"Well, George doesn't think $13,000 is enough money."
4,4,3,HELEN,What? He's not even working.
4,4,3,MORTY,George is right. Those people will try to get away with murder. Believe me. They're all crooks.
4,4,3,HELEN,"Jerry, I want you to sign that contract."
4,4,3,JERRY,We're going to sign it. We're going to sign it. In fact George is out with the woman from NBC right now.
4,4,4,GEORGE,"So, I'm uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to pass."
4,4,4,SUSAN,You're passing?
4,4,4,GEORGE,"Well, it's . . . much too low."
4,4,4,SUSAN,Are you and Jerry in complete agreement on this?
4,4,4,GEORGE,"Ah, yeah, . . . I believe I can speak for the both of us on this."
4,4,4,SUSAN,"Because you know, because this is your first show this is a pretty standard deal."
4,4,4,GEORGE,Standard?
4,4,4,SUSAN,Yeah.
4,4,4,GEORGE,Is Ted Danson's deal standard?
4,4,4,SUSAN,Ted Danson?
4,4,4,GEORGE,"You know, the guy from Cheers."
4,4,4,SUSAN,"Yeah, I know who he is. You're not Ted Danson."
4,4,4,GEORGE,I didn't say I was Ted Danson.
4,4,4,SUSAN,"All right, I'll tell Russell tomorrow."
4,4,4,SUSAN,"Oh, uh, before I forget, . . . cigars. A present from my father."
4,4,4,GEORGE,"Oh, uh, do I have to write him a note or something?"
4,4,4,SUSAN,"Yeah, I am sure he'd appreciated that."
4,4,4,GEORGE,But what do I say in the note?
4,4,4,SUSAN,"Ah, you're a writer. You'll think of something."
4,4,4,GEORGE,"Oh, uh, yeah, I'm a writer,"
4,4,5,HELEN,Were you waiting long at the gate?
4,4,5,JERRY,I don't even know?
4,4,5,HELEN,Where's that watch we bought you?
4,4,5,JERRY,Oh uh
4,4,6,JERRY,That's enough with this piece of junk I've had it.
4,4,6,GEORGE,That's the one your parents bought you?
4,4,6,JERRY,"Yeah, but it never worked."
4,4,7,JERRY,. . . it's being fixed.
4,4,7,MORTY,"I got a guarantee on that watch. Give it to me, I'll take it back to where I got it."
4,4,7,JERRY,It's at the jeweler.
4,4,7,MORTY,You send me the bill.
4,4,7,JERRY,I'm not sending you the bill.
4,4,7,HELEN,That watch was a gift. You shouldn't have to pay for it.
4,4,7,GSUSAN,"That's uh, $18.50."
4,4,7,MORTY,"Here, I got it."
4,4,7,JERRY,What are you talking about? It's my car. You can pay for the gas.
4,4,7,MORTY,"No, no put it away . . ."
4,4,7,JERRY,Dad!
4,4,7,MORTY,Stop it.
4,4,7,JERRY,I have money. I make money.
4,4,7,MORTY,"Yeah, yeah, you make money."
4,4,7,JERRY,You don't think I make money. That's what you think isn't it?
4,4,7,HELEN,"No, I don't think that."
4,4,7,JERRY,Yes you do. That's what you both think.
4,4,7,MORTY,I'll pay.
4,4,7,JERRY,I'm paying.
4,4,7,MORTY,Get out of here.
4,4,7,JERRY,You're not paying
4,4,7,MORTY,"Jerry please,"
4,4,7,JERRY,You're not doing this.
4,4,9,JERRY,"Boy, you got a lot of stuff here. . . . Dad, what are you doing?"
4,4,9,MORTY,Nothing nothing.
4,4,9,JERRY,Leave it. What about your back?
4,4,9,HELEN,"Morty, what are you doing?"
4,4,9,MORTY,"All right, all right."
4,4,9,JERRY,You come all the way up here to see a back specialist and you're lifting heavy suit cases.
4,4,10,KRAMER,"Hey, Morty."
4,4,10,MORTY,"Hey, Mr. Kramer."
4,4,10,KRAMER,"Hey, Mrs. Seinfeld."
4,4,10,HELEN,What happened to you?
4,4,10,KRAMER,Well some guy kicked me in the side of the head.
4,4,10,HELEN,What guy?
4,4,10,KRAMER,Crazy Joe Devola.
4,4,10,HELEN,Why?
4,4,10,KRAMER,"Well, I was having this party and I didn't invite him and Jerry tipped him off."
4,4,10,JERRY,Why did you tell this crazy guy that Kramer didn't invite him to his party?
4,4,10,JERRY,I didn't know he wasn't invited
4,4,10,MORTY,"Hey, these are very comfortable pants. You know what I paid for these Jerry?"
4,4,10,HELEN,So why did you say anything?
4,4,10,JERRY,It was a mistake.
4,4,10,MORTY,They're good around the house and they're good for outside.
4,4,10,HELEN,Are you okay?
4,4,10,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah, yeah. I was a little off last week - but the doctor says it was just a slight concussion"
4,4,10,HELEN,So what's the matter with this Devola guy?
4,4,10,JERRY,He's got like a chemical imbalance. He needs to be on medication.
4,4,10,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah. He's after Jerry now."
4,4,10,JERRY,Kramer!!
4,4,10,HELEN,He's what?!
4,4,10,JERRY,He's joking.
4,4,10,HELEN,He's after you?
4,4,10,JERRY,Nooo.
4,4,10,HELEN,Why is he after you?
4,4,10,JERRY,He's not after me.
4,4,10,HELEN,"Morty, did you here this? Some crazy guy is after Jerry."
4,4,10,HELEN,I'll make a few phone calls.
4,4,10,JERRY,Who are you going to call?
4,4,10,MORTY,What are you worried about?
4,4,10,HELEN,I want to know what you did to this guy that he's after you.
4,4,10,JERRY,I didn't do anything.
4,4,10,HELEN,Well you must have done something.
4,4,10,JERRY,"No, he just doesn't like me."
4,4,10,HELEN,Doesn't like you? How can anyone not like you?
4,4,10,JERRY,"You know, it seems impossible."
4,4,10,HELEN,Doesn't like you? How can that be?
4,4,10,JERRY,"Ma, I know this may be hard for you to understand but I am sure there are many people who do not like me."
4,4,10,HELEN,"Huh, Jerry, don't say that."
4,4,10,JERRY,It's true.
4,4,10,HELEN,"No, it's not true. You're a wonderful, wonderful boy. Everybody likes you. It's impossible not to like you. Impossible. Morty?"
4,4,10,MORTY,Maybe some people don't like him. I could see that.
4,4,10,HELEN,Kramer?
4,4,10,KRAMER,"Yeah, I like him. Hey Jerry, what time you got?"
4,4,10,JERRY,"Um, huh, I don't have my watch on. It's being fixed."
4,4,10,KRAMER,When you getting it back?
4,4,10,JERRY,"Uh, next week."
4,4,10,KRAMER,Next week? How come it's taking so long?
4,4,10,JERRY,Huh?
4,4,10,KRAMER,I said how come it's taking so long?
4,4,10,JERRY,I don't know. They're backed up.
4,4,10,KRAMER,"wait a minute, wait a minute, where did you take it?"
4,4,10,JERRY,Where'd I take it?
4,4,10,KRAMER,Yeah.
4,4,10,JERRY,"Where did I take it? Where Did I Take It? Um, to that place on, uh Columbus and uh, 85th. Okay?"
4,4,10,KRAMER,Jimmy Sherman's?
4,4,10,JERRY,Yeah.
4,4,10,KRAMER,"Yeah, I know the guy. I take my stuff in there all the time. Yeah, I bet I can get your watch back by tomorrow morning."
4,4,10,JERRY,"No, Kramer, I don't want you to say anything to him"
4,4,10,KRAMER,I'd be happy to.
4,4,10,JERRY,He's a friend of mine.
4,4,10,JERRY,I'd like to follow the regular procedures. I don't want any special treatment.
4,4,10,KRAMER,"Hey, I'm going to get that watch back for you by tomorrow, buddy."
4,4,10,MORTY,Give me the receipt.
4,4,10,KRAMER,I'll get that too.
4,4,10,JERRY,Be right back.
4,4,11,JERRY,". . . I threw it in the garbage can on the street. It didn't keep good time. My parents gave it to me so don't mention it again, okay!"
4,4,11,KRAMER,All right.
4,4,11,JERRY,All right.
4,4,11,KRAMER,"Wait, wait , . . ."
4,4,12,HELEN,What was that about?
4,4,12,KRAMER,"Oh, oh, uh, he's got my Calamine lotion and uh, I told him not to return it. If he needs it he should keep it. He's got uh, he's got a thing on his ankle."
4,4,12,HELEN,How can anyone not like him.
4,4,13,MORTY,"Hi, Morty Seinfeld. I have a two o'clock appointment."
4,4,13,RECEPTIONIST,"Yes, Mr. Seinfeld. Would you please fill in this form."
4,4,13,MORTY,All this? This whole thing? It's going to take me forty-five minutes.
4,4,13,RECEPTIONIST,I know. It's very long.
4,4,13,MORTY,Look at this. It's a book. Employer's address. What do they need this? You know I never had a back problem until that night I slept on the convertible sofa. My back was fine.
4,4,13,HELEN,"Well, it's not the sofa."
4,4,13,MORTY,You stick up for that sofa like I'm criticizing a person.
4,4,13,HELEN,We got it at Sullivan's. It's a good store.
4,4,13,MORTY,One day somebody's going to sleep on that thing and we'll get sued. I hope this doctor knows what he's doing.
4,4,13,HELEN,Leo says he's the best there is.
4,4,13,MORTY,"Leo, I'm listening to Leo now!"
4,4,13,HELEN,You're lucky he was able to get you this appointment. You know what the waiting list is for this guy?
4,4,13,MORTY,"Well, if he fixes my back I'll be happy. . . . Have you ever had a sexually transmitted disease? That's IT! . . . Here, you got my name, you got my address. That's enough."
4,4,13,RECEPTIONIST,"Julie, you want to take him back?"
4,4,14,JERRY,You what? You passed? How could you do that?
4,4,14,GEORGE,"Jerry, my young friend, you are so naïve. You are so so naïve. You know about a few things. You know about comedy, a little bit about relationships, some baseball, but you are so far out of your element here, you are embarrassing yourself. Now listen to me. I am negotiating. Negotiation, this is what you do in business."
4,4,14,JERRY,"Let me explain to you what you just did. There are literally hundreds of people trying to get pilot deals with them this year. They go with maybe, five. Okay, if we pass, they go to the next show."
4,4,14,GEORGE,"Ooooo, I'm scared. . . . Ooooo they're not going to do the show."
4,4,14,JERRY,"We're lucky they are even interested in the idea in the first place. We got a show about nothing. With no story. What do you think, they're up there going, maybe we should give those two guys, who have no experience and no idea, more money!"
4,4,14,GEORGE,Oooo what are we going to do? I'm shaking! I'm shaking!
4,4,14,JERRY,"Well, I think you're wrong."
4,4,14,GEORGE,"Well, we'll just see."
4,4,14,JERRY,Yes we will.
4,4,14,GEORGE,Yes we will.
4,4,14,JERRY,I just said that.
4,4,14,GEORGE,I know you did.
4,4,14,JERRY,So good for you.
4,4,14,GEORGE,So good for you.
4,4,14,JERRY,We'll you're repeating everything I'm saying?
4,4,14,GEORGE,We'll you're repeating everything I'm saying?
4,4,14,JERRY,Well George is an idiot.
4,4,14,GEORGE,"Well George,,. . . ."
4,4,15,MORTY,"All right, all right, Let's go already. They keep you in here a year. They don't give a damn. I could die in here. . . . Excuse me! Excuse me! What's going on? I'm here twenty minutes. Could somebody please help me."
4,4,15,HELEN,Shhh. Quiet! Everyone can hear you.
4,4,15,MORTY,Twenty minutes. I've been waiting twenty minutes.
4,4,15,HELEN,Well the doctor must be busy.
4,4,15,MORTY,"Well what do they make appointments for if they can't keep them. uh, look if I did that in my business I wouldn't have made a nickel ."
4,4,15,NURSE,"Hello, Mr. Seinfeld."
4,4,15,MORTY,I thought you forgot about me.
4,4,15,NURSE,We didn't forget.
4,4,16,MORTY,Ah! It's Velcro. I can't stand Velcro. It's that t-e-a-r-I-n-g sound. I used to be in raincoats. I refused to put that in any of my lines.
4,4,16,NURSE,"Okay, Mr. Seinfeld, please come this way. We need some X-rays."
4,4,16,MORTY,Leave all my stuff here?
4,4,16,NURSE,Leave it.
4,4,18,GEORGE,"Okay, by the way. Do you want a box of Cuban cigars? I smoked one last night. I got nauseous."
4,4,18,JERRY,No I don't want them.
4,4,19,KRAMER,"I'll take it. No, I'll take it. What is it?"
4,4,19,GEORGE,Here you go.
4,4,19,KRAMER,A box of cigars?
4,4,19,GEORGE,"Yep,"
4,4,19,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah?"
4,4,19,GEORGE,The kind that Castro smokes. You can't buy them anywhere.
4,4,19,KRAMER,Castro eh? Pasto costillo homiga
4,4,20,JERRY,Yes?
4,4,20,VOICE,Federal Express.
4,4,20,JERRY,Federal Express? Come on up. . . . Federal Express. I'm not expecting a package.
4,4,20,KRAMER,"Wooo, you know what you just did? You let a burglar into the building."
4,4,20,JERRY,You think so?
4,4,20,KRAMER,Federal Express? Of course. It's the oldest trick in the book. You know it might not be a burglar it might be a murderer.
4,4,20,JERRY,So you want us to abolish all home package deliveries.
4,4,20,KRAMER,Yes. It's dangerous.
4,4,21,JERRY,Who is it?
4,4,21,VOICE,Federal Express.
4,4,21,KRAMER,"Okay, . . ."
4,4,22,ALL,Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!
4,4,22,ELAINE,"Kramer, Hi, I thought you went to California."
4,4,22,KRAMER,I came back for you.
4,4,22,ELAINE,"Oh, shut up"
4,4,22,JERRY,I missed you.
4,4,22,ELAINE,Really?
4,4,22,JERRY,"Yeah, . . ."
4,4,23,KRAMER,I'm going to be right back. I'm going to get a match.
4,4,23,ELAINE,Who's suitcase is this?
4,4,23,JERRY,"Oh, it's my parents. My father came up to see a back specialist."
4,4,23,ELAINE,"Oh, golly, it's probably from sleeping on that sofa."
4,4,23,GEORGE,"Boy, you look really great."
4,4,23,JERRY,Yeah.
4,4,23,ELAINE,You lie.
4,4,23,GEORGE,"No, no you really look great."
4,4,23,ELAINE,"Hu hu, ha."
4,4,23,JERRY,So tell us about the trip. How's Dr. Reston?
4,4,23,ELAINE,"Oh, he's fine."
4,4,23,JERRY,Things are good?
4,4,23,ELAINE,"Yeah, you know"
4,4,23,JERRY,Uh oh.
4,4,23,ELAINE,"What, Uh ih?"
4,4,23,JERRY,Did you see that?
4,4,23,GEORGE,"Yeah, I saw it."
4,4,23,ELAINE,What?
4,4,23,JERRY,It's a tell. You gotta tell.
4,4,23,ELAINE,What tell? What's a tell?
4,4,23,JERRY,When you ask someone about their relationship and they touch their face you know it's not going too well. Go ahead ask me how it's going with somebody.
4,4,23,ELAINE,"Um, uh, who's it going with, uh, Alice?"
4,4,23,JERRY,"Good, going good And the higher up on the face you go the worse the relationship is getting. You know it is like - pretty good - not bad - I gotta get out."
4,4,23,ELAINE,How high did I go?
4,4,23,GEORGE,You almost did the nose.
4,4,23,JERRY,What are you eating my peanut butter out of the jar with your disgusting index fingers? This is a sickening display.
4,4,23,GEORGE,I'm not eating bread now. I'm off bread.
4,4,23,JERRY,You're off bread. . . . So what happened is it over?
4,4,23,ELAINE,Well not quite.
4,4,23,JERRY,Why not?
4,4,23,ELAINE,"He was my psychiatrist, you know. He knows all my patterns. In my relationships I always try to find some reason to leave, so as my doctor, he can't allow me to do this, so he's not letting me leave."
4,4,23,GEORGE,"What do you mean - ""Not letting you?"""
4,4,23,ELAINE,"He has this power over me, okay. He has this way of manipulating every little word I say. He's like a Svenjolly."
4,4,23,GEORGE,Svengali.
4,4,23,ELAINE,What did I say?
4,4,23,JERRY,Svenjolly.
4,4,23,ELAINE,Svenjolly? I did not say Svenjolly.
4,4,23,JERRY,George?
4,4,23,GEORGE,Svenjolly.
4,4,23,ELAINE,I don't see how I could have said Svenjolly.
4,4,23,JERRY,So maybe he's got like a cheerful mental hold on you.
4,4,24,KRAMER,You know I can't find a match anywhere.
4,4,24,GEORGE,You know what you should do? You should tell this guy you're seeing somebody else. That's the easiest way to get out of these things.
4,4,24,ELAINE,"No, it's not going to work with this guy."
4,4,24,GEORGE,"Well, you just tell him an old boyfriend has come back into your life."
4,4,24,ELAINE,I don't think so.
4,4,24,JERRY,Nice try.
4,4,24,GEORGE,Took a shot.
4,4,24,KRAMER,This is a good cigar . . . WOOOOOOOOOOW . . .
4,4,25,MORTY,"So, when do I get to see the doctor?"
4,4,25,NURSE,He'll be in with the X-Rays in a few minutes. You can get dressed.
4,4,25,MORTY,They stole my wallet. The bum stole my wallet. MY WALLET'S
4,4,26,NURSE,Are you sure?
4,4,26,MORTY,"Yes, I'm sure. I went in to get my X-Ray Somebody takes my wallet. Is that the operation here?"
4,4,27,DR. DEMBROW,"Mr. Seinfeld, I'm Dr. Devro"
4,4,27,MORTY,I'm not interested in the X-Rays. I want my money back. Somebody stole my wallet. I had $225 in there.
4,4,27,DR. DEMBROW,"Why, I don't see how something like that could have happened."
4,4,27,MORTY,"Oh, you don't see. You don't see. Well it happened. Believe me."

4,4,27,DR. DEMBROW,"All right, Mr. Seinfeld, I am sorry about your wallet but would you like me to look over these X-Rays?"
4,4,27,MORTY,What kind of clip joint are you running here?
4,4,27,DR. DEMBROW,"All right, fine."
4,4,27,HELEN,The least you could have done was hear your diagnosis.
4,4,27,MORTY,I am not interested in his diagnosis. He's a bum.
4,4,27,HELEN,You came all the way from Florida to see him.
4,4,27,MORTY,I want to know what kind of an office this is where you can't leave your pants in the room. You tell me.
4,4,28,ELAINE,I am sorry but there's somebody else.
4,4,28,DR. RESTON,"Huh, huh."
4,4,28,ELAINE,"Well it's nothing I planned on happeniong, you knoe. It just kind of happened."
4,4,28,DR. RESTON,Tell me about him.
4,4,28,ELAINE,"Well, there's not really much to tell, you know, he's just a guy. Really."
4,4,28,DR. RESTON,"Yes, I assumed he was a guy. And you've known him how long?"
4,4,28,ELAINE,". . . Years. Years, um, we've been close friends and then recently something you know just happened."
4,4,28,DR. RESTON,You mean sexually?
4,4,28,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah. Sexu-ally."

4,4,29,ELAINE,"Well, I was just telling you about this other guy."
4,4,29,DR. RESTON,"Elaine, do you remember your dream where you have a sexual encounter with a Chinese woman?"
4,4,29,ELAINE,"Yeah. Yeah, ha um."
4,4,29,DR. RESTON,"Elaine, I'm concerned about you."
4,4,29,ELAINE,"Oh, don't concern yourself with me, because I'm good. I'm very good, I mean I'm really very very good."
4,4,29,DR. RESTON,Elaine. Have you been urinating a lot again?

4,4,29,ELAINE,His name?
4,4,29,DR. RESTON,"Yes, his name."
4,4,29,ELAINE,"Um, what's the difference?"
4,4,29,DR. RESTON,Are you afraid to tell me his name?
4,4,29,ELAINE,"No, no, I just don't see how that's relevant."
4,4,29,DR. RESTON,It doesn't matter if you don't see how. I see how.
4,4,29,ELAINE,"Uh, his name, uh, Idon't even know, all right you want to know his name? I'll tell you his name. His name is . . . Kramer."

4,4,29,ELAINE,"Oh, I'm really uncomfortable talking about this."
4,4,29,DR. RESTON,"Elaine, I want you to do me a favor."
4,4,29,ELAINE,What?
4,4,29,DR. RESTON,I want you to tell this young man to give me a call. It is very important that I speak to him.
4,4,29,ELAINE,"Oh, no, no no no, I can't do that."

4,4,29,ELAINE,"Okay, okay. I'll have Kramer give you a call."
4,4,30,JERRY,So you didn't even let the doctor treat you?
4,4,30,MORTY,I wouldn't give him the satiusfaction.
4,4,30,HELEN,Why did you leave your wallet in your pants?
4,4,30,MORTY,What are you talking about? What was I supposed to hide it somewhere?
4,4,30,HELEN,Well. You could have taken it with you.
4,4,30,MORTY,"Oh, yeah, I'd be lying on the X-Ray table with my wallet in my mouth."
4,4,31,LEO,"Hello, ,hello."
4,4,31,JERRY,Hi Uncle Leo.
4,4,31,LEO,I just talked to Dr. Denvro's son. He said they almost had to call the police.
4,4,31,MORTY,What are you talking about? I'm the one who should have called the police. They stole my wallet.
4,4,31,LEO,You know how hard it was for me to get thjat appointment for you? You can't just walk in on this guy. He did me a personal favor.
4,4,31,MORTY,"All right, Leo."
4,4,31,LEO,You walked out without paying.
4,4,31,MORTY,How was I supposed to pay? I didn't have my wallet.
4,4,31,LEO,"Well, I hope you sent him a check."
4,4,31,MORTY,What for?
4,4,31,LEO,What for? This man was nice enough to see you. He did me a personal favor.
4,4,31,MORTY,"That's the second time you said ""personal favor"". Why do you keep saying that?"
4,4,31,LEO,I said it once.
4,4,31,MORTY,Twice! And Dembrowdoesn't even know you. His son happens to live on your floor.
4,4,31,HELEN,"Leo, where did you get that watch?"
4,4,31,LEO,You know where I got this? I found it in the garbage can. It kept terrible time. I brought it over to Jimmy Sherman right here on 85th and Columbus. Gave it to me back the next day. Works great. What kind of idiot throws a way a perfectly good watch?
4,4,31,HELEN,Doesn't that watch look like the one we gave Jerry.
4,4,31,JERRY,"Hey, where's the waiter. Dad, what say we have some red meat tonight. Let's live a . ."
4,4,32,JERRY,Can we continue this another time.
4,4,32,THE END,
