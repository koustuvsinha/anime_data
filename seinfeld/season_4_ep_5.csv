4,5,257,MORTY,"Hey! Look at this, a wallet. Exactly what I needed, y'see."
4,5,257,JERRY,"C'mon, you lost your wallet, I figured I'd get you another one."
4,5,257,HELEN,I hope you didn't spend too much on that.
4,5,257,MORTY,I wanna tell you. This is one of the most thoughtful gifts
4,5,258,HELEN,"He's something, you son, isn't he?"

4,5,266,GEORGE,"Yeah, like he was really gonna take your money."
4,5,266,JERRY,"Oh, he took it. I put four hundred dollars in the new wallet."
4,5,266,GEORGE,You're kidding.
4,5,266,JERRY,He lost all that cash. It was the only way I could give it back
4,5,267,GEORGE,"Man, would I like to see the look on his face."
4,5,268,MORTY,You believe this?
4,5,268,HELEN,What?
4,5,268,MORTY,It's velcro.
4,5,268,HELEN,You're kidding.
