4,6,28,SUSANAOMI,"Oh,"
4,6,28,GEORGE,What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think like that dry cleaning plastic?
4,6,28,JERRY,That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. anyway what can I do I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow.

4,6,32,ELAINE,"hey, what's with George and Susan? Does he actually like her?"
4,6,32,JERRY,"Ah, I don't know if he likes her as much as he likes it."
4,6,32,ELAINE,"Oh, that's nice!"

4,6,32,ELAINE,Well you know George. It's not enough to get there. you gotta make good time.
4,6,32,JERRY,I know he once went from West 81st Street to Kennedy Airport in 25 minutes.
4,6,34,GEORGE,Would you stop that please. Would you just stop that?
4,6,34,SUSANAOMI,Why?
4,6,34,GEORGE,... just sit in your seat over there you're distracting me. We're making incredible time here.
4,6,37,JERRY,What's he doing? Is he out of his mind? Do you see him? I don't even think I see him anymore. Where is he?
4,6,37,ELAINE,Isn't that blue car him?
4,6,37,JERRY,"No, no that's not him. What happened to him? I can't believe it. I lost him. That stupid idiot."
4,6,38,ELAINE,It's no big deal Jerry. We'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
4,6,38,JERRY,I don't even know where the bubble boy lives. I don't even remember the name of the town.
4,6,38,ELAINE,"Wa',you don't have the directions?"
4,6,38,JERRY,"No, I was following him."

4,6,41,SUSANAOMI,We lost them. Do you KNOW THAT. WE LOST
4,6,41,GEORGE,It's not my fault. Seinfeld can't drive. How hard is it to follow somebody?
4,6,41,SUSANAOMI,Well now what are you going to do?

4,6,49,SUSANAOMI,Come on lets go in.

4,6,49,SUSANAOMI,Well we should at least tell them what happened. They might be very late if they make it at all.
4,6,49,GEORGE,I can't go in there. I can't face the bubble boy.
4,6,49,SUSANAOMI,What's the matter?
4,6,49,GEORGE,I just don't react well to these situations. My grandmother died two months early because of the way I reacted in the
