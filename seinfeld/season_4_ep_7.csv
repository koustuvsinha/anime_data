4,7,0,THE CHEEVER LETTERS,Written by Larry David
4,7,2,JERRY,She hasn't told her father yet?
4,7,2,GEORGE,No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.
4,7,2,JERRY,"""We're""? What do you mean, ""We're""?"
4,7,2,GEORGE,Susan wants me to be there.
4,7,2,JERRY,You're meetin' the father for the first time?
4,7,2,GEORGE,Yeah.
4,7,2,JERRY,"Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down."
4,7,2,GEORGE,I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!
4,7,2,JERRY,"I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it: Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars.."
4,7,2,GEORGE,"Yeah, I know what happened."
4,7,2,JERRY,"No, but wait, wait: And then you dump them off onto Kramer.."
4,7,2,GEORGE,I know.
4,7,2,JERRY,"..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars! It's very comical.."
4,7,2,GEORGE,"Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind."
4,7,2,JERRY,"No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day."
4,7,2,GEORGE,"I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn"
4,7,3,JERRY,"C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin."
4,7,3,GEORGE,We could build a cabin like that.
4,7,3,JERRY,"Well, maybe not us, but two men could."
4,7,3,GEORGE,"Bics? What, d'ja get, bics?"
4,7,3,JERRY,"What, you got a problem with the pen now?"
4,7,3,GEORGE,"Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth."
4,7,3,JERRY,"Alright, let's just get to work. NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I,"
4,7,4,GEORGE,"So, you're gonna sit there?"
4,7,4,JERRY,"Just - just park yourself. Alright. Act I, Scene A."
4,7,4,GEORGE,Drink?
4,7,4,JERRY,"No, no thank you."
4,7,4,GEORGE,"Alright, here we go."
4,7,4,JERRY,"Act I, Scene A.."
4,7,5,GEORGE,Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?
4,7,5,JERRY,"Yes. Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh,"
4,7,11,ELAINE,"Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happenin' here.. Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go."
4,7,13,JERRY,"Okay, let's go."
4,7,13,GEORGE,"Alright, here we go. You got it?"
4,7,13,JERRY,Yeah.
4,7,13,GEORGE,Here we go.
4,7,13,JERRY,"Okay, how about this: I'm in my apartment, you come in."
4,7,13,GEORGE,"It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?"
4,7,14,ELAINE,"Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long?"
4,7,14,SANDRA,Why? Did Jerry say something?
4,7,14,ELAINE,"No, no."
4,7,14,SANDRA,He must have said something.
4,7,14,ELAINE,"Oh, no, he didn't say anything."
4,7,14,SANDRA,I can't work for you! I can't. I'm leaving.
4,7,14,ELAINE,"No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a"
4,7,16,GEORGE,"Alright, let's go."
4,7,16,JERRY,Here we go.
4,7,17,KRAMER,Hey.
4,7,17,GEORGE,"yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work.."
4,7,17,JERRY,"Yeah, come on. What's with you?"
4,7,17,KRAMER,No more golf.
4,7,17,JERRY,Why?
4,7,17,KRAMER,"Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple"
4,7,18,JERRY,Yeah.
4,7,18,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire! Hey, George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for"
4,7,19,GEORGE,"What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!"
4,7,19,KRAMER,Why? What's one thing got to do with another?
4,7,19,GEORGE,"Kramer, please."
4,7,19,KRAMER,"Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it,"
4,7,20,GEORGE,"Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else."
4,7,20,KRAMER,Where? They're Cubans.
4,7,20,GEORGE,You know what? Maybe I should take off.
4,7,20,JERRY,What?!
4,7,20,GEORGE,"Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time."
4,7,20,JERRY,You got four hours! What about the script?
4,7,20,GEORGE,I think we got a bite on it.
4,7,23,MRS. ROSS,"Doesn't George look like your sister, Sarah?"
4,7,23,MR. ROSS,A slight resemblance.
4,7,24,MRS. ROSS,"Her son's a podiatrist, you know."
4,7,24,GEORGE,"Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean.."
4,7,25,MR. ROSS,How are you enjoying those cigars I gave you?
4,7,25,GEORGE,"Oh, uh, the cigars.. I'm, uh, suckin' 'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah."
4,7,25,MR. ROSS,You know those cigars are made special for Castro?
4,7,25,GEORGE,I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild.
4,7,25,MR. ROSS,What?
4,7,25,SUSAN,"He's doing Johnny Carson, daddy."
4,7,25,MR. ROSS,I didn't care much for his jokes.
4,7,25,SUSAN,Daddy never laughs.
4,7,25,GEORGE,"Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going ""Ha, ha!""? What is that? ""Ha, ha!""?"
4,7,25,MR. ROSS,"You know, you can't get those cigars anywhere."
4,7,25,MRS. ROSS,You and your cigars..
4,7,25,MR. ROSS,Wear some more lipstick.
4,7,25,SUSAN,"Daddy, there's, um, there's something that we have to talk to you about.."
4,7,25,MR. ROSS,"Oh, I forgot to ask you - how'd you like the cabin?"
4,7,25,GEORGE,"Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. well,"
4,7,28,JERRY,"Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this"
4,7,29,ELAINE,I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?
4,7,29,JERRY,Ohh.. dial the number. How could you do this?
4,7,29,ELAINE,I was just trying to help you.
4,7,29,JERRY,"Oh, just trying to help me.. Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her"
4,7,37,GEORGE,The cabin.. Well.. Susan?
4,7,37,SUSAN,Uhh.. about the cabin..
4,7,37,MR. ROSS,"I love that place. My father built that cabin in 1947. My mother was recuperating from Impetigo at the time, and dad thought it would"
4,7,40,GEORGE,Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude.
4,7,40,MR. ROSS,What?
4,7,40,GEORGE,
4,7,40,MR. ROSS,"When I go, I'm passing it on to her."
4,7,40,MRS. ROSS,I'll take a hotel any day.
4,7,40,SUSAN,Daddy..
4,7,40,MR. ROSS,Yes?
4,7,40,SUSAN,"Daddy, about the cabin.."
4,7,40,MRS. ROSS,"Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me!"
4,7,40,MR. ROSS,What about it?
4,7,40,SUSAN,"Well, the thing is.."
4,7,40,MR. ROSS,What? What is it?
4,7,40,SUSAN,"Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George?"
4,7,40,GEORGE,Burned.
4,7,40,MR. ROSS,Burned?
4,7,40,SUSAN,"There was a fire, and it uh.."
4,7,40,GEORGE,Burned.
4,7,40,MR. ROSS,The cabin burned?
4,7,40,GEORGE,"yeah, burned. Whoo.."
4,7,40,MRS. ROSS,Burned!
4,7,40,MR. ROSS,Was anything found? Was it all burned to the ground?! Did they find anything?
4,7,40,SUSAN,No. Nothing.
4,7,40,MRS. ROSS,"Nothing! Ha, ha, ha."
4,7,41,GEORGE,"Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's really rather ironic - one might even"
4,7,46,SANDRA,I can't believe you said that!
4,7,46,JERRY,What?!
4,7,46,SANDRA,How could you say something like that to me?!
4,7,46,JERRY,What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!
4,7,46,SANDRA,That was a weird thing to say.
4,7,46,JERRY,Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.
4,7,46,SANDRA,"Ohh, I think you're really sick."
4,7,46,JERRY,I'm not sick. You - you said much sicker things than me.
4,7,46,SANDRA,I'm leaving.
4,7,46,JERRY,I really think you're making too much of this.
4,7,46,SANDRA,Excuse me.
4,7,46,JERRY,Let me walk you to a cab.
4,7,46,SANDRA,That's ok.
4,7,46,JERRY,"I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it."
4,7,46,SANDRA,"Oh, really?"
4,7,46,JERRY,"I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't."
4,7,49,JERRY,"So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she starts rubbing my leg."
4,7,49,GEORGE,Wo-hoah! What did you do?
4,7,49,JERRY,Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?
4,7,49,GEORGE,"Yeah, right."
4,7,49,JERRY,"I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the"
4,7,50,GEORGE,"Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?"
4,7,50,JERRY,"I don't know, they're working on a whole other level.."
4,7,50,GEORGE,"Alright, so, go ahead."
4,7,50,JERRY,So we go back to my apartment..
4,7,50,GEORGE,Woah. Whoa! Woah!
4,7,50,JERRY,"So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting a little passionate.. and, uh, she starts"
4,7,51,GEORGE,"Alright, alright, hold on! Time out! Woah, woah! What did she say?"
4,7,51,JERRY,"Oh, you know, the usual.."
4,7,51,GEORGE,"No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?"
4,7,51,JERRY,Typical things.
4,7,51,GEORGE,What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme some typical.
4,7,51,JERRY,"She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup bottle - ketchup squirts out"
4,7,52,GEORGE,That's very dirty. That's absolutely filthy.
4,7,52,JERRY,..And then she starts talking about her panties.
4,7,52,GEORGE,Gonna need some water here!
4,7,52,JERRY,So I said something.
4,7,52,GEORGE,"Ok, what did you say?"
4,7,52,JERRY,"Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up."
4,7,52,GEORGE,Of course.
4,7,52,JERRY,"Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I said, ""You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?"""
4,7,52,GEORGE,"""The panties your mother laid out for you""? What"
4,7,53,JERRY,I don't know! It just popped out.
4,7,53,GEORGE,"Well, how did she react?"
4,7,53,JERRY,She flipped out! Just left.
4,7,53,GEORGE,"Well, that's not offensive. It's abnormal, but it's not offensive."
4,7,53,JERRY,"Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me"
4,7,55,JERRY,She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that?
4,7,56,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing."
4,7,56,JERRY,I guess he failed to see the humor in it.
4,7,56,GEORGE,"Huh. C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today."
4,7,56,JERRY,"Alright, big work day."
4,7,56,GEORGE,That's right.
4,7,59,GEORGE,Okay.
4,7,59,JERRY,Let's go.
4,7,59,GEORGE,Here we are.
4,7,59,JERRY,Right now.
4,7,59,GEORGE,Let's do it.
4,7,59,JERRY,You and me.
4,7,59,GEORGE,Okay.
4,7,59,JERRY,Alright.
4,7,59,GEORGE,What'dya got?
4,7,59,JERRY,"I got: You enter, you go ""Hi"", and I go, ""Hello."" Now.. we need something here.."
4,7,60,KRAMER,"Oh, hey."
4,7,62,GEORGE,Don't be silly.
4,7,62,JERRY,"Come in, we're taking a break."
4,7,62,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah?"
4,7,62,JERRY,Yeah!
4,7,62,KRAMER,"Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars?"
4,7,62,GEORGE,"No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that."
4,7,62,KRAMER,"Okay.. well, I guess I'm just going to have to take matters into my own hands, huh? Alright, I'll see you guys. (Leaves, despite"
4,7,66,KRAMER,Buenos dias.
4,7,66,SECRETARY,Buenos dias.
4,7,66,KRAMER,"Uh, habla ingles?"
4,7,66,SECRETARY,Si.
4,7,66,KRAMER,"Giddy-up. Ok, uh, Um. I need to talk to someone."
4,7,66,SECRETARY,What is this about?
4,7,66,KRAMER,"Uh, well, It's a very private matter, but it's extremely urgent."
4,7,66,SECRETARY,Are you an American?
4,7,66,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah."
4,7,66,SECRETARY,I see.. excuse me.
4,7,66,KRAMER,Okay.
4,7,70,JERRY,"Alright, let's get going. C'mon, c'mon now. C'mon, let's get it together.. (Through"
4,7,71,ELAINE,It's Elaine.
4,7,71,JERRY,C'mon up.
4,7,71,GEORGE,"Alright, you know what we should do? We should go to the movies. Get away from this script for a while.."
4,7,71,JERRY,"Yeah, we should."
4,7,71,GEORGE,"Alright, I just have to go over to the Ross' apartment and drop off Susan's sunglasses. You'll come with me?"
4,7,71,JERRY,"Yeah. Wha - what, does she live with them?"
4,7,71,GEORGE,"No, no, no, no."
4,7,71,JERRY,Oh.
4,7,72,ELAINE,"Hey, nice going, Jerome Seinfeld!"
4,7,72,JERRY,What?
4,7,72,ELAINE,"I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to work."
4,7,72,JERRY,"Well, then, you've just got to fire her! Don't even think about it - there's no two ways about it."
4,7,72,ELAINE,Why? What happened? Did you talk?
4,7,72,JERRY,Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn't anybody you should
4,7,73,ELAINE,Really?
4,7,73,JERRY,Yes.
4,7,73,ELAINE,Really? You really think I should fire her?
4,7,73,JERRY,"Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy here working on the script, I'd do it myself."
4,7,77,MAN,Expira te afuera.
4,7,77,KRAMER,Buenos dias.
4,7,77,MAN,"What is your name, Senor?"
4,7,77,KRAMER,"Uh, Kramer."
4,7,77,MAN,"So, Senor Kramer, what is this about?"
4,7,77,KRAMER,Cigars.
4,7,77,MAN,Cigars?
4,7,77,KRAMER,Cigars.
4,7,77,MAN,What about cigars?
4,7,77,KRAMER,"Uh, see here, I.. I saved one of the cigar rings.."
4,7,77,MAN,Ohh.. You mean - one of these..
4,7,77,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah. That- that's, uh, okay, So, uh, I'd like to buy a couple of boxes of those from you, yeah?"
4,7,77,MAN,"You do realize, of course, these are illegal in your country."
4,7,77,KRAMER,"Um, wha - oh, illegal, huh?"
4,7,78,MAN,I like that jacket..
4,7,81,SUSAN,Hi!
4,7,81,GEORGE,"Hi, how are ya?"
4,7,81,SUSAN,"Hey, Jerry."
4,7,81,JERRY,Hi.

4,7,81,JERRY,"Ah, just - takin' a little break."
4,7,81,GEORGE,"yeah. Uh, oh, here's your sunglasses."
4,7,81,SUSAN,"Ok, thanks. Come on in for a second. This is my brother,"
4,7,82,GEORGE,"Ohh, hey there, young fella. What's your major?"
4,7,82,RICKY,I don't have one.
4,7,82,GEORGE,"Well, you should always consider podiatry. There's nothing wrong with the feet."
4,7,82,SUSAN,"And this is my Aunt, Sara."
4,7,82,SARA,He doesn't look like me.
4,7,82,MRS. ROSS,"Sara, what do you have on your wheels?"
4,7,82,SARA,"Nothing, they're clean."
4,7,82,MRS. ROSS,"Ricky, did you wipe her wheels off?"
4,7,82,RICKY,Yes.
4,7,82,MRS. ROSS,"Well, they're filthy. It's just a matter of common courtesy.. When you come in the house you"
4,7,84,SUSAN,"Excuse me. Hello, Raymond."
4,7,84,RAYMOND,"Ah, yes, the man from the insurance company dropped this off this morning. He said it was the only thing left from the remains of the fire."
4,7,84,SUSAN,"Oh, thank you. Wow, I've never seen this before.."
4,7,85,GEORGE,"Oh, sure."
4,7,85,SUSAN,From.. from John Cheever.
4,7,85,JERRY AND GEORGE,"Oh, wow."
4,7,85,SUSAN,"""Dear Henry, last night with you was bliss. I fear my.. orgasm (She now has everyone's"
4,7,88,GEORGE,"Well, we.. we, we, ah.."
4,7,88,JERRY,Yeah..

4,7,90,MRS. ROSS,I want to know who John is!
4,7,90,RICKEY,"John Cheever?! Dad, you and John Cheever?!"
4,7,90,MR. ROSS,"Yes! Yes, he was the most wonderful person I've ever known. And I love him deeply! In a way you could never understand.. (Slowly"
4,7,91,GEORGE,"Well, we really should be-"

4,7,95,GEORGE,"""How's it going?"" - beautiful."
4,7,96,JERRY,"Alright, did you get that line?"
4,7,96,GEORGE,"""How's it going?"""
4,7,96,JERRY,Did you write it down?
4,7,96,GEORGE,"I'm writin' it. ""How's it going?"""
4,7,96,JERRY,Okay..
4,7,96,ELAINE,Real good!
4,7,96,JERRY,What?!
4,7,96,ELAINE,Do you know how much money you cost me today?! 429 dollars!
4,7,96,JERRY,What?! How?
4,7,96,ELAINE,"I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?! So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!"
4,7,96,JERRY,What calls?!
4,7,96,ELAINE,"Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe, okay?! And we've been in touch, and Sandra told Lippman!"
4,7,96,JERRY,"Oh, did - did she say anything else to you?"
4,7,96,ELAINE,"""Anything else""? What do you mean ""anything else""?"
4,7,96,JERRY,So she just left the office - didn't say a word to you about anything?
4,7,96,ELAINE,Yeah!
4,7,96,JERRY,Beautiful.
4,7,96,ELAINE,Why is that beautiful?
4,7,96,JERRY,"Oh, no, not beautiful."
4,7,96,ELAINE,It's four hundred and twenty nine dollars!
4,7,96,JERRY,"Hey, look, I'm going to pay for that."
4,7,96,ELAINE,"No, no."
4,7,96,JERRY,"No, I insist. I was the one who encouraged you to fire her - the whole thing was all my-"
4,7,96,ELAINE,Okay.
4,7,96,JERRY,fault. Do you smell smoke?
4,7,97,KRAMER,"Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you to meet my new friends, here. This is, uh, Louis, Jorge, and Umberto."
4,7,97,JERRY,"Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you."
4,7,97,KRAMER,"Yeah, we're heading up to Westchester - gonna hit the links."
4,7,97,JERRY,"Oh. Isn't that, uh, your.."
4,7,97,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah, yeah, Okay, we're going. Vamanos, muchachos!"
4,7,98,ELAINE,"Hey, what are you reading?"
4,7,98,GEORGE,"Oh, uh, ""The Falconer"" by John Cheever. It's really excellent."
4,7,98,ELAINE,"John Cheever, you ever read any of his stuff?"
