5,10,0,THE CONVERSION,Written by Bruce Kirschbaum
5,10,1,JERRY,You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. But
5,10,11,GEORGE,Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is
5,10,12,GEORGE'S GIRLFRIEND,Twenty five dollars.
5,10,12,GEORGE,"Yes, well, you know, I'm not thinking about the price. You know"
5,10,14,GEORGE'S GIRLFRIEND,"George, George, uh, I think we have to talk. I think we"
5,10,15,GEORGE,We do?
5,10,15,GEORGE'S GIRLFRIEND,We can't keep seeing each other.
5,10,15,GEORGE,Why?
5,10,15,GEORGE'S GIRLFRIEND,"Because it's over. *sob, sob, sob* It's my"
5,10,17,WAITER,"Uh, have you decided yet?"
5,10,17,GEORGE'S GIRLFRIEND,Yes. I'll have the lobster.
5,10,17,GEORGE,"Um, you know I'm starting to think that maybe lobster isn't the way"
5,10,19,JERRY,Then he asked you out?
5,10,19,ELAINE,"We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his"
5,10,20,JERRY,On your heart?
5,10,20,ELAINE,"Jerry, the man is a doctor."
5,10,20,JERRY,Doctor? He's a podiatrist.
5,10,20,ELAINE,It's the same thing.
5,10,20,JERRY,Anyone can get into podiatry school. *George* got into podiatry
5,10,21,ELAINE,Really?
5,10,21,JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND,Hello.
5,10,21,JERRY,Oh hi.
5,10,21,JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND,Are you going to be stopping by later?
5,10,21,JERRY,"Yes, I'll be stopping. See you later. Well we can't all"
5,10,23,GEORGE,It's over.
5,10,23,ELAINE,What?
5,10,23,JERRY,How did you get in?
5,10,23,GEORGE,Kramer.
5,10,23,ELAINE,What's that?
5,10,23,GEORGE,Lobster.
5,10,23,JERRY,Looks like a swan.
5,10,23,GEORGE,She says we can't go out anymore.
5,10,23,ELAINE,Why?
5,10,23,GEORGE,Because I'm not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents won't let her get
5,10,24,ELAINE,"Latvian Orthodox? Mmm, it is lobster."
5,10,24,JERRY,She's limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad.
5,10,24,GEORGE,I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well that's not
5,10,25,ELAINE,"Mmm, delicious."
5,10,25,JERRY,"Mmm, succulent."
5,10,25,GEORGE,"She knew I didn't have a job, she knew I lived at home. Didn't seem"
5,10,26,ELAINE,Why don't you just ask her parents?
5,10,26,GEORGE,"I can't. I met them. They're devout. You know, In the cab on the"
5,10,27,JERRY,To Latvian Orthodox?
5,10,27,GEORGE,Why not? What do I care?
5,10,27,JERRY,You know it's not like changing toothpaste.
5,10,27,ELAINE,I think it would be romantic.
5,10,27,GEORGE,Really?
5,10,27,ELAINE,"Yeah, it's like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne and marrying"
5,10,28,GEORGE,"King Edward. King Edward, Jerry."
5,10,28,JERRY,Yeah well King Edward didn't live in Queens with Frank and Estelle
5,10,29,GEORGE,You know what? I could probably do this. What's the difference.
5,10,29,ELAINE,George I was just kidding around.
5,10,29,GEORGE,No. I wouldn't even have to tell her. I could surprise her.
5,10,29,ELAINE,George I wasn't serious.
5,10,29,GEORGE,"How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, have a"
5,10,32,ELAINE,I guess this one is my fault.
5,10,32,JERRY,Oh yeah.
5,10,33,JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND,"*kiss, kiss, kiss* Oh that was nice. Have you always"
5,10,34,JERRY,Oh I don't know. Not always. No I uh I had to work at it. When I
5,10,36,JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND,Well it was worth it. *kiss* I'll be *kiss* right *kiss*
5,10,37,JERRY,To wash my hands. They're sticky from the orange.
5,10,37,JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND,Meet you back here?
5,10,37,JERRY,Right there.
5,10,39,JERRY,"""Fungicide"". Fungus?"
5,10,40,JERRY,Fungicide. I mean what could she have?
5,10,40,ELAINE,I don't know.
5,10,40,KRAMER,Fungus.
5,10,40,ELAINE,So what did you say?
5,10,40,JERRY,I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go
5,10,41,ELAINE,What were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?
5,10,41,JERRY,I didn't open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little.
5,10,41,ELAINE,You were snooping.
5,10,41,JERRY,I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking
5,10,42,KRAMER,I would. I always open medicine cabinets.
5,10,42,ELAINE,Well I trust people not to do that.
5,10,42,KRAMER,Big mistake.
5,10,42,JERRY,Why don't you ask that doctor what it is?
5,10,42,ELAINE,What? Now he's a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist.
5,10,42,JERRY,But that's what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. They're knee-
5,10,43,ELAINE,I am not going to ask him about funguses.
5,10,43,KRAMER,Fungi.
5,10,43,JERRY,What?
5,10,43,KRAMER,Fungi.
5,10,45,FATHER-PRIEST,Why do you want to accept the Latvian Orthodox faith?
5,10,45,GEORGE,"*ahem* In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man begins to ask"
5,10,47,FATHER-PRIEST,Enigmatic?
5,10,47,GEORGE,No.
5,10,47,FATHER-PRIEST,Vast?
5,10,47,GEORGE,No not vast
5,10,47,FATHER-PRIEST,"Well whatever it is, basically you like the religion."
5,10,47,GEORGE,Yes.
5,10,47,FATHER-PRIEST 2,Is there one aspect of the faith that you find particularly
5,10,48,GEORGE,I think the hats. The hat convey that solemn religious
5,10,49,FATHER-PRIEST,Are you familiar with Orthodox theology?
5,10,49,GEORGE,"Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know the basic"
5,10,50,FATHER-PRIEST,Plot?
5,10,50,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and the"
5,10,51,FATHER-PRIEST 2,Well it's obvious that you are sincere in your desire.
5,10,51,GEORGE,"Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft, am I in?"
5,10,51,FATHER-PRIEST,The first step would be to familiarize yourself with these
5,10,52,GEORGE,"Ah hah. You see Father, I'm I'm incredibly anxious to become a"
5,10,55,SISTER ROBERTA,"Oh I'm sorry. Father, there's a man waiting in the chapel."
5,10,55,FATHER-PRIEST,"You may attend to it Sister, oh this is George Costanza. He"
5,10,56,SISTER ROBERTA,Oh are you? That's wonderful. Well good luck to you.
5,10,56,GEORGE,Nice nun.
5,10,56,FATHER-PRIEST,"No, Sister Roberta is not a nun. She is what we call a"
5,10,57,FATHER-PRIEST 2,She won't be taking her final vows until next Thursday.
5,10,58,SISTER ROBERTA,May I help you?
5,10,58,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, I'm here to pick up my friend George Costanza."
5,10,58,SISTER ROBERTA,Well he's in with the Father.
5,10,58,KRAMER,Oh yeah.
5,10,58,SISTER ROBERTA,I'm Sister Roberta.
5,10,58,KRAMER,Oh. Kramer. Pleasure.
5,10,58,SISTER ROBERTA,Mine.
5,10,59,GEORGE,I can't believe how easy it is. I'm virtually Orthodox. All I have
5,10,60,JERRY,That's all there is to it.
5,10,60,GEORGE,That's all there is to it. By Christmas day I will be Brother
5,10,61,JERRY,And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza?
5,10,61,GEORGE,Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence.
5,10,62,JERRY,Oh a slinky. Where did you get it?
5,10,62,KRAMER,Sister Roberta gave it to me.
5,10,62,JERRY,Why did she give you that?
5,10,62,KRAMER,I think she liked me.
5,10,62,JERRY,What do you mean she liked you?
5,10,62,KRAMER,*Liked* me.
5,10,62,GEORGE,"Kramer, they like everybody. They're friendly people."
5,10,62,KRAMER,No. I think I picked up on a vibe.
5,10,62,JERRY,"You picked up on a vibe, from a nun."
5,10,62,KRAMER,"Yeah, Jerry I'm telling you I have this power. And I have no control"
5,10,65,JERRY,Oh hi.
5,10,65,JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND,I just wanted to stop by and see how you were feeling.
5,10,65,JERRY,A little better. *fake cough*
5,10,65,JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND,If you need anything let me know.
5,10,65,JERRY,Okay. All right bye.
5,10,65,GEORGE,Story.
5,10,65,JERRY,She's subletting Carol's place for a month.
5,10,65,GEORGE,She likes you.
5,10,65,JERRY,Yeah but there's a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide in her
5,10,66,GEORGE,So?
5,10,66,JERRY,So I don't know what she's using it for.
5,10,66,GEORGE,Well how do you even know it's hers? Maybe it belonged to Carol.
5,10,67,JERRY,I didn't even think to look.
5,10,67,GEORGE,Well take a look. It might not even belong to her.
5,10,67,JERRY,Yeah.
5,10,67,GEORGE,People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet.
5,10,67,JERRY,Yeah I've got this old bottle of cough medicine.
5,10,67,GEORGE,I still have brill cream.
5,10,70,JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND,Hi.
5,10,70,JERRY,Hi. Can I use your bathroom?
5,10,71,ELAINE,You sure you don't mind?
5,10,71,DOCTOR,No of course not. People ask me medical questions all the
5,10,72,ELAINE,Well the question isn't even for me it's for a friend.
5,10,72,DOCTOR,"Elaine, I'm used to it. I'm a doctor."
5,10,72,ELAINE,Well... podiatrist.
5,10,72,DOCTOR,Huh?
5,10,72,ELAINE,"No no, I'm just saying you didn't really go to medical school, you"
5,10,73,DOCTOR,I went to podiatry school because I like feet. I chose to work with
5,10,74,ELAINE,I like feet too. I'm just saying...
5,10,74,DOCTOR,Saying what?
5,10,77,JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND,How are you doing in there?
5,10,77,JERRY,"Fine all done, just looking for the soap."
5,10,78,JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND,No soap?
5,10,78,JERRY,No I don't see it.
5,10,81,JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND,Here you go.
5,10,84,ESTELLE,George what are you doing in there?
5,10,84,GEORGE,What? Nothing.
5,10,84,FRANK,You've been in there an hour.
5,10,84,ESTELLE,You don't feel well?
5,10,84,GEORGE,I'm fine.
5,10,84,ESTELLE,I want to know what you're doing in there.
5,10,84,GEORGE,Nothing.
5,10,84,FRANK,"George, open the door."
5,10,84,GEORGE,No.
5,10,84,ESTELLE,Georgie.
5,10,84,GEORGE,No!
5,10,87,KRAMER,Hey.
5,10,87,SISTER ROBERTA,"Good evening. I hope I'm not disturbing you, but I found"
5,10,90,JERRY,"Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle? And I'll need that in the"
5,10,91,GEORGE,I don't know. I can't believe they're making me take this test.
5,10,92,JERRY,"Hey, did you talk to the doctor?"
5,10,92,ELAINE,No.
5,10,92,JERRY,"All right, the next time you see him show him this. (He presents the"
5,10,93,ELAINE,You *took* her medicine.
5,10,93,JERRY,Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the tube. When
5,10,94,ELAINE,I don't know. We got into this whole thing about how podiatrists
5,10,95,JERRY,How could you say that?
5,10,95,ELAINE,It's you fault. You just got me thinking.
5,10,95,JERRY,I was merely speaking extemporaneously.
5,10,95,ELAINE,I've got nothing against the foot. I'm pro-foot.
5,10,95,JERRY,Me too.
5,10,95,ELAINE,Do you think I should call him and apologize?
5,10,95,JERRY,Yes. He's a doctor.
5,10,96,JERRY,Wait a second.
5,10,97,JERRY,What are you doing?
5,10,97,GEORGE,What does it look like I'm doing?
5,10,97,JERRY,"""Matthew, Luke, Paul"", what"
5,10,99,KRAMER,I told you.
5,10,99,JERRY,What?
5,10,99,KRAMER,I told you she liked me.
5,10,99,JERRY,Who?
5,10,99,KRAMER,Sister Roberta.
5,10,99,JERRY,How do you know?
5,10,99,KRAMER,She told me. She said she's never had a man stir up all of these
5,10,103,FATHER-PRIEST,"I must say George, I was somewhat surprised at the results of"
5,10,105,GEORGE,"Oh, I'm I'm full of it Father."
5,10,105,FATHER-PRIEST 2,...... Kramer
5,10,106,FATHER-PRIEST,"Yes, yes I see. I'm sorry something has come up."
5,10,106,GEORGE,"Oh, I understand."
5,10,107,KRAMER,"Um, you wanted to see me Father?"
5,10,107,FATHER-PRIEST,"Yes. Please, sit down. Sister Roberta came to see me"
5,10,108,KRAMER,I know what this is about Father. I didn't do anything. I just
5,10,110,FATHER-PRIEST,Yes. Kavorka.
5,10,111,KRAMER,Kavorka?
5,10,111,FATHER-PRIEST,"It is a Latvian word which means ""the lure of the animal""."
5,10,111,KRAMER,I don't understand.
5,10,111,FATHER-PRIEST,Women are drawn to you. They would give anything to be
5,10,112,KRAMER,Help me Father. Help me.
5,10,112,FATHER-PRIEST,"Yes, yes I will help you. Listen very carefully. I want you"
5,10,114,JERRY,What is that stench? I got it. (He follows the smell to Kramer's
5,10,117,KRAMER,Hey.
5,10,117,JERRY,Hey. What are you doing?
5,10,117,KRAMER,I've got the Kavorka Jerry.
5,10,117,JERRY,The Kavorka? What's that?
5,10,117,KRAMER,The lure of the animal. I'm dangerous.
5,10,117,JERRY,What is this thing around your neck?
5,10,117,KRAMER,The priests they're helping me. I just bathed in vinegar.
5,10,117,JERRY,You know you're funcifying the whole building.
5,10,117,KRAMER,Keep away Jerry. Keep away.
5,10,118,JERRY,"Kramer. *knock, knock, knock* Kramer."
5,10,120,WOMAN,George Costanza? Estelle's son?
5,10,121,ESTELLE,Latvian Orthodox? Why are you doing this?
5,10,121,GEORGE,For a woman.
5,10,121,FRANK,A woman? What are you out of your mind?
5,10,121,ESTELLE,Why can't you do anything like a normal person?
5,10,121,FRANK,Wait. Is this the group that goes around mutilating squirrels?
5,10,121,GEORGE,No it's a regular religion.
5,10,121,FRANK,I'm calling my lawyer. It might not be too late to get out of this.
5,10,121,GEORGE,I don't want to get out of it.
5,10,121,ESTELLE,"George, you don't know what you're saying. You're under their"
5,10,122,FRANK,"What, they brainwashed you?"
5,10,122,GEORGE,No no.
5,10,122,FRANK,You're not performing any rituals in this house.
5,10,122,ESTELLE,Go back to the psychiatrist. I beg you.
5,10,122,FRANK,And stay away from those squirrels.
5,10,123,JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND,Oh how you doing Jerry?
5,10,123,JERRY,Good. What's the matter?
5,10,123,JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND,I'm tired. I hardly slept last night with all this
5,10,124,JERRY,Bonkers?
5,10,124,JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND,My cat. He's got this weird sort of skin condition.
5,10,125,JERRY,Oh it's your cat!
5,10,125,JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND,What?
5,10,125,JERRY,"Ooh, nothing."
5,10,126,FATHER-PRIEST,Are you ready my son?
5,10,126,GEORGE,Yes faddah.
5,10,126,FATHER-PRIEST,What did you say?
5,10,126,GEORGE,What?
5,10,126,FATHER-PRIEST,I thought you said faddah.
5,10,126,GEORGE,"I said faddah, I meant Father. Just a little bit nervous."
5,10,128,KRAMER,How you doing?
5,10,128,WOMAN,Get away from me you creep.
5,10,128,KRAMER,"Yes, Yes. It worked. Sister Roberta I've still got time to catch"
5,10,140,FATHER-PRIEST,Congratulations George. Welcome to the faith. Sister Roberta
5,10,141,SISTER ROBERTA,I can't. I'm sorry. It's a
5,10,143,SISTER ROBERTA,Him.
5,10,143,CROWD,"Kavorka, Kavorka."
5,10,144,ELAINE,"*kiss, kiss* Because I love the foot. I'm a big fan of the foot."
5,10,144,DOCTOR,Well it's my fault. I got a little defensive.
5,10,144,ELAINE,"And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie toe."
5,10,144,DOCTOR,It's my favorite toe.
5,10,144,ELAINE,"Let's face it, you get a bunion, where are you going? You're not"
5,10,145,DOCTOR,No you're not.
5,10,146,ELAINE,I'll be right back.
5,10,146,DOCTOR,"Oh uh, where's the bathroom?"
5,10,146,ELAINE,It's right down here to the left. I will meet you right back here.
5,10,146,JERRY,Elaine it's her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need the tube
5,10,149,DOCTOR,"""Fungicide""? Fungus?"
5,10,150,SISTER ROBERTA,Something's wrong. I don't feel the same lure.
5,10,150,KRAMER,You don't?
5,10,150,SISTER ROBERTA,What have I...? I must return to the church. By the way you
5,10,151,KRAMER,Yeah yeah.
5,10,153,GEORGE'S GIRLFRIEND,For me?
5,10,153,GEORGE,Well I didn't do it for my mother.
5,10,153,GEORGE'S GIRLFRIEND,I'm really flattered. But I just don't feel ready to
5,10,154,GEORGE,Latvia?
5,10,154,GEORGE'S GIRLFRIEND,Yes. I'm going to stay with some relatives there for a
5,10,155,GEORGE,"Enjoy, enjoy."
5,10,155,GEORGE'S GIRLFRIEND,"Oh George, you are so sweet. Don't ever change."
5,10,155,GEORGE,I'd like a doggie bag for this please.
5,10,155,THE END,
