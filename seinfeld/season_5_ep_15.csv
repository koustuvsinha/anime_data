5,15,0,THE STAND-IN,Written by Larry David
5,15,1,JERRY,"The bus is the single stupidest, fattest, slowest, most despised vehicle on the road. Isn't it? You ever notice when you get behind the bus, people in your car go 'what are you doing? get away, come on.' The back of the bus is like an eclipse isn't it? people are just like 'the sun, where's the sun?' It's like this huge metal ass taking up the whole wind shield of your car. When it pulls out it even sounds like a fat uncle trying to get out of a sofa."
5,15,2,GEORGE,"It's just not good, it's not good."
5,15,2,JERRY,It's not good.
5,15,2,GEORGE,"I'm bored. She's boring, I'm boring, we're both boring. We got out to eat, we both read newspapers."
5,15,2,JERRY,Well at breakfast everybody reads.
5,15,2,GEORGE,"No. Lunch we read, dinner we read."
5,15,2,JERRY,You read during lunch?
5,15,2,GEORGE,Ya
5,15,2,JERRY,"Oh, well."
5,15,2,GEORGE,There's nothing to talk about.
5,15,2,JERRY,"Ya, what's there to talk about."
5,15,2,GEORGE,Well at least you and I are talking about how there's nothing to talk about.
5,15,2,JERRY,Why don't you talk to her about how there's nothing to talk about?
5,15,2,GEORGE,She knows there is nothing to talk about.
5,15,2,JERRY,At least you'll be talking.
5,15,2,GEORGE,Oh shut up.
5,15,3,AL,"Hey, look who's here."
5,15,3,JERRY,"Hey, Al."
5,15,3,GEORGE,"Hey, Al. How's it going?"
5,15,3,AL,"Deeply in love. We have soo many things to talk about. Sometimes we'll talk all night, till the sun comes up so how about you?"
5,15,3,GEORGE,"Oh I'm seeing someone, yes. You know her, Daphne Bower."
5,15,3,AL,Great girl.
5,15,3,GEORGE,We have no need to speak. We communicate with deep soulful looks.
5,15,3,JERRY,Like Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower.
5,15,3,AL,Oh did you hear about Fulton?
5,15,3,JERRY,Ya.
5,15,3,AL,I went by the hospital to see him a few days ago think he'd really like you to come visit.
5,15,3,JERRY,Me?
5,15,3,AL,"Ya, he said he could use a good laugh."
5,15,3,GEORGE,What about me?
5,15,3,AL,He didn't mention you. This is my stop. Uh see ya.
5,15,3,GEORGE,Ya
5,15,3,JERRY,"Ya, see ya."
5,15,4,GEORGE,"Deeply in love. If you can't say anything bad about a relationship, you shouldn't say anything at all."
5,15,4,JERRY,Ya.
5,15,6,GEORGE,I didn't even know Fulton was in the hospital.
5,15,6,JERRY,"Could use a good laugh. You know what kind of pressure that is? Come on, come with me."
5,15,6,GEORGE,"Na no, I'm not good in these situations. I can't hide my pity. I..I make em feel worse."
5,15,6,JERRY,"Oh, stop it."
5,15,6,GEORGE,Ya and also I'm afraid that people in that state are finally going to tell me what they really think of me. You know they got nothing to lose what do they care?
5,15,6,JERRY,So you're not gonna come?
5,15,6,GEORGE,No but say hello for me.
5,15,7,KRAMER,Hey!
5,15,7,JERRY,Hey! Hey Mick.
5,15,7,MICKEY,Hey Jerry.
5,15,7,KRAMER,What's doing?
5,15,7,JERRY,"Nothing, what's doing with you?"
5,15,7,KRAMER,"Same old, same old."
5,15,7,JERRY,George this is Mickey.
5,15,7,GEORGE,"Hi, nice to meet you."
5,15,8,MICKEY,Pleasure.
5,15,8,JERRY,How's work going you guys?
5,15,8,MICKEY,Lets not even talk about it.
5,15,8,GEORGE,You got a job?
5,15,8,KRAMER,"Ya, Mickey. He hooked me up. We're stand-ins for the actors on 'All My Children.' Mickey, he's a stand-in for an eight year old kid and I stand in for the kids father."
5,15,8,MICKEY,"But I got a big problem. The kid I stand in for, he's growing. He was four feet last month, now he's like four-two and a half. He shot up two and a half inches. I can do four-two, four-three is a stretch, any higher than that and I'm gonna be out on my ass doing that paralegal crap."
5,15,8,JERRY,How do you stop a kid from growing?
5,15,8,KRAMER,"I told you, you should offer him some cigarettes."
5,15,8,MICKEY,"I offered him cigarettes, but his stupid mother is hanging around. She won't let him have any."
5,15,8,KRAMER,What about lifts?
5,15,8,MICKEY,Out of the question.
5,15,8,GEORGE,Can't you just switch with another Midget?
5,15,9,MICKEY,"It's little people, you got that?"
5,15,9,KRAMER,"Easy Mickey, easy."
5,15,9,GEORGE,Yap..
5,15,9,KRAMER,All right we gotta get back to the show. What are you guys doing?
5,15,9,JERRY,"I'm going to the hospital, to visit Fulton."
5,15,9,KRAMER,"Oh, oh well say hello for me."
5,15,10,KRAMER,"Now look, we're going to stop at the shoe maker right now. You gotta get some lifts for your shoes."
5,15,10,MICKEY,"Lifts?! Look Kramer you don't understand, this kind of thing is just not done."
5,15,10,KRAMER,You wanna keep your job don't you?
5,15,10,MICKEY,Ya but..
5,15,11,KRAMER,
5,15,11,MICKEY,Kramer
5,15,14,JERRY,"Hey, woahoh Fulton. It's me."
5,15,14,FULTON,"Hey Jerry, good to see ya. I could really use a good laugh."
5,15,14,JERRY,Who couldn't.
5,15,14,FULTON,I haven't cracked a smile in months.
5,15,14,JERRY,"Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other. Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit."
5,15,14,FULTON,It's a fine time.
5,15,14,JERRY,"Oh, all right ah well... There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they're all staring at him...."
5,15,16,GEORGE,So how were the eggs?
5,15,16,DAPHNE,Eggs are eggs.
5,15,16,GEORGE,"Eggs are eggs. That is very profound. By the same token you could say fish is fish. Ha ha ha, I don't think so. Listen Daphne"
5,15,16,DAPHNE,Daphne.
5,15,16,GEORGE,"Daphne. I have to tell you something, this is very difficult..."
5,15,16,DAPHNE,"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Al Netchie called me today."
5,15,16,GEORGE,"Ya, ya. I bumped into him on the bus. What did he have to say?"
5,15,16,DAPHNE,He told me not to get involved with you.
5,15,16,GEORGE,What?
5,15,16,DAPHNE,"Ya, he said you could never make a commitment to any one and you'd just wind up hurting me."
5,15,16,GEORGE,He said that? What a nerve. How dare he say something like that.
5,15,16,DAPHNE,Is it true?
5,15,16,GEORGE,"Of course not. I mean sure, there may have been one or two occasions in the past, when I may have reacted in uh impulsive or somewhat immature manner, but those days are well behind me."
5,15,18,SON,How long are you going to be away for Daddy?
5,15,18,FATHER,"I'm not really going away, I told you, I'll be back every other weekend."
5,15,18,SON,"Don't go Daddy, don't go."
5,15,18,FATHER,"Now Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much, but sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug."
5,15,18,DIRECTOR,...and there's your scene. Stand-ins
5,15,18,KRAMER,Yo
5,15,18,STAGE HAND,All right you guys get on their spots so we can fix the lights.

5,15,19,MICKEY,How long you going to be away for Daddy?
5,15,19,KRAMER,"I'm not really going away, I told you I'd be back every other weekend."
5,15,19,MICKEY,"Don't go Daddy, don't...go."
5,15,19,KRAMER,"Now listen Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much. But sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug."
5,15,20,MICKEY,Ah! all right all right! Kramer!
5,15,20,DIRECTOR,Ok everybody that's lunch... one hour.
5,15,21,KRAMER,How do those lifts feel?
5,15,21,MICKEY,Quiet.

5,15,21,JOHNNY,"Nah, that's not it. Something else... Ya you look different."
5,15,22,MICKEY,"You don't, you got the same ugly mug since the day I met ya."
5,15,22,JOHNNY,"I don't know what it is, but I'll find out. I'll find out."
5,15,24,JERRY,"..so uh she's just sitting there and a uh Pachyderm, you remember the derm. He says uh, I'm gonna go up to her. So we uh he uh picks up the two pieces of pizza and uh the uh and then they're steaming hot and they're burning his hands see so he... he's juggling em he's jugglin em, jus throwing them up in the air and just as he gets up to her down they go. Well we all just lost it. It was really, really, funny."
5,15,25,PHIL,Hey Jerry.
5,15,25,JERRY,Hey Phil how you doing?
5,15,25,PHIL,You look terrific.
5,15,25,JERRY,I got my health.
5,15,25,PHIL,"Well, that's the most important thing. Hey how ya doing Fulton! Octane, Butane, Nitrane! How's he doing?"
5,15,25,JERRY,He could use a couple laughs.
5,15,27,ELAINE,You should have told that story about Pachyderm dropping the pizza.
5,15,28,JERRY,I told it. Ya?
5,15,28,GEORGE,Ya
5,15,28,JERRY,Ya. Hey you know what as I was leaving I bumped into Phil Titola. He is one of the greatest guys.
5,15,28,ELAINE,Do I know him?
5,15,28,JERRY,"No, but I'll tell you something. Of all the guys I know, I could envision you going out with him."
5,15,28,ELAINE,If you were a woman would you go out with him?
5,15,28,JERRY,If I was a woman I'd be down at the dock waiting for the fleet to come in.
5,15,28,ELAINE,"Ya, I bet you would. all right, give him my number."
5,15,28,JERRY,all right.
5,15,29,GEORGE,"This you are not going to believe. Al Netchie, that pimple. Tells Daphne, not get this 'Not to get involved with me.'"
5,15,29,JERRY,What?
5,15,29,GEORGE,Ya. That's what she told me.
5,15,29,ELAINE,Why?
5,15,29,GEORGE,Because he's afraid she's gonna get hurt.
5,15,29,ELAINE,Is she?
5,15,29,GEORGE,Of course.
5,15,29,ELAINE,So?
5,15,29,GEORGE,Wa.. He doesn't have to tell her.
5,15,29,ELAINE,Maybe he likes her.
5,15,29,GEORGE,"Oh no no no. He's deeply in love, and I was just about to break up with her when she told me."
5,15,29,JERRY,So what are you gonna do?
5,15,29,GEORGE,Well I can't break up with her now.
5,15,29,JERRY,Why?
5,15,29,GEORGE,Because he said I was going to.
5,15,29,ELAINE,"So now you're going to keep going out with her, for spite?"
5,15,29,GEORGE,"Yes, I am."
5,15,29,JERRY,"Ya, I could see that."
5,15,29,GEORGE,I don't see any way around it.
5,15,29,JERRY,"No, me either."
5,15,29,GEORGE,What choice do I have?
5,15,29,JERRY,None.
5,15,33,JERRY,Fulton's wife told me it's all my fault. She said since my visit he's taken a turn for the worse.
5,15,33,KRAMER,Did you tell him the Pachyderm story?
5,15,33,JERRY,Yes I told him the Pachyderm story!
5,15,33,KRAMER,Maybe I outta go over there.
5,15,33,JERRY,Towards what end?
5,15,33,KRAMER,"I'm very good with sick people. They love me. When my friend Len Nicodemo had the gout, I moved into his hospital room for three days, the doctors were amazed at his recovery."
5,15,35,KRAMER,Hey.
5,15,35,JERRY,Hey Mick.
5,15,35,MICKEY,Johnny Vigiano went through my locker.
5,15,35,MICKEY,That little Bastard! He saw the lifts in my shoes. He knows I'm heightening. This never would have happened if you hadn't pushed me to get those things. I told you.
5,15,35,KRAMER,"Hey, nobody put a gun to your head."
5,15,35,MICKEY,Ya well just keep out of my business you big ape.
5,15,35,KRAMER,Who you calling big ape?
5,15,35,MICKEY,You
5,15,36,JERRY,"All right break it up, break it up. Come on, just cut it out now"
5,15,36,KRAMER,Ya.
5,15,37,MICKEY,I'm sorry Kramer.
5,15,37,KRAMER,"No no it's all right, it's all right. You're stressed Oout!"
5,15,37,JERRY,Why does this guy Johnny have it in for you?
5,15,37,MICKEY,"Oh, he's always been jealous of me. I always get to stand in for the bigger stars; The Cosby Kids, Ricky Schroder, Macaulay Culkin."
5,15,37,KRAMER,What's he like huh?
5,15,37,MICKEY,He's a good kid.
5,15,37,KRAMER,Ya?
5,15,37,JERRY,So what does he care if you put lifts in?
5,15,37,MICKEY,"You don't understand. There's an unwritten code about this kind of thing. I could be ostracized. I remember when I was a kid, some guy tried to heighten. He lost his job, lost his friends, Everything. Oh, I knew I was crazy to try this kind of thing, but I was so desperate. What is this kid taking anyway? Hormones? Steroids? Would you tell me!?"
5,15,38,DAPHNE,"George, tomorrow's Sunday. We could sleep late, and get the paper and half breakfast and spend the morning together, go for a long walk, maybe do a little shopping, have lunch..."
5,15,38,GEORGE,You know what. I don't think I'm going to be able to stay over tonight.
5,15,38,DAPHNE,Why not?
5,15,38,GEORGE,
5,15,38,DAPHNE,I thought we were going to spend the day together.
5,15,38,GEORGE,"Well Dad's been planning this for such a long time, he bought a new blanket, and he got tha...that game with foam paddles and the Velcro ball."
5,15,38,DAPHNE,"Have you given any more thought to what we talked about? You know, moving in?"
5,15,38,GEORGE,"Yes, oh yes very much."
5,15,38,DAPHNE,Maybe you don't want to move in.
5,15,38,GEORGE,"No, no I do. You know it's just..."
5,15,38,DAPHNE,"Maybe Al Netchie was right, maybe I shouldn't have gotten involved with you."
5,15,38,GEORGE,No he's not right. Al Netchie is not right! all right I'm canceling the father-son picnic. I don't know what he's gonna do with all that potato salad.
5,15,39,ELAINE,"So then Pachyderm picks up the pieces of pizza, and mind you know they are burning hot.. he can barely hold 'em. I mean he's like trying to juggle the pizza, you know ah. And then they go flying out of..."
5,15,39,PHIL,I'm peeing in my pants.
5,15,39,ELAINE,"they go flying out of his hands, and one lands on her face and the other lands on his face. and the whole place went crazy."
5,15,39,PHIL,"Oh, I'm sorry, Oh. What a story."
5,15,39,ELAINE,"I know, I know, I was unbelievable"
5,15,40,PHIL,Oh that is one of the funniest stories I've ever heard.
5,15,40,ELAINE,I know.
5,15,40,PHIL,Well this has been one hell of a night.
5,15,40,ELAINE,"Oh, I'm sorry Jerry didn't suggest this sooner."
5,15,40,PHIL,"You know, you really are beautiful Elaine."
5,15,40,ELAINE,"Oh, well, Good night."
5,15,40,PHIL,Good night?
5,15,40,ELAINE,Well
5,15,42,JERRY,"Come on Adrian give me another chance, I know I could cheer Fulton up. I'll tell you what, I'll do my act No new material He's never heard it. He'll love it, I just did it at the Concord last week. It killed. Thank you, thanks fo.. you will not regret this. Ok, Bye. Hey."
5,15,42,ELAINE,Hello.

5,15,42,JERRY,Are you sure?
5,15,42,ELAINE,Oh quite.
5,15,42,JERRY,There was no mistaking it?
5,15,42,ELAINE,Jerry.
5,15,42,JERRY,"So you were talking, you're having pleasant conversation, then all of sudden..."

5,15,43,KRAMER,Hey. Hey how was your date with Phil Titola?
5,15,43,ELAINE,He took it out.
5,15,44,KRAMER,"Maybe uh, it needed some air. You know sometimes they need air, they can't breathe in there. It's in human."

5,15,46,JERRY,Well how long you are going to keep this up?
5,15,46,GEORGE,Hey I'll get married if I have to. Al Netchie will think twice before he opens his mouth about me again.
5,15,46,JERRY,You know George they are doing wonderful things at mental institutions these days. I'd be happy to set-up a meet and greet.
5,15,46,GEORGE,I'm very disappointed to here you talk like that. You still don't know what makes me tick.
5,15,46,JERRY,Yes I do.
5,15,46,GEORGE,What are you doing?
