5,18,0,THE RAINCOATS PART 2,"Written by Tom Gammill, Max Pross, Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld"
5,18,2,KRAMER,So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?
5,18,2,MORTY,"I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror."
5,18,2,KRAMER,How serendipitous.
5,18,2,MORTY,So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.
5,18,2,KRAMER,Mmm
5,18,2,JERRY,He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. Alright come on let's play.
5,18,2,KRAMER,Did you call Jack Klompus yet?
5,18,2,MORTY,I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now.
5,18,2,JERRY,Ah come on.
5,18,2,MORTY,Just a second.
5,18,2,HELEN,Jerry have you seen Schindler's List?
5,18,2,JERRY,No I haven't seen it yet.
5,18,2,HELEN,Oh you have to go you have to
5,18,2,JERRY,I'm going
5,18,2,HELEN,You have to
5,18,2,JERRY,Ok
5,18,2,MORTY,Hello Jack.
5,18,3,JACK,Ya
5,18,3,MORTY,It's Morty
5,18,3,JACK,Who died?
5,18,3,MORTY,Nobody died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. In my garage there are a couple of boxes.
5,18,3,JACK,What boxes?
5,18,3,MORTY,I'm gonna explain what boxes.
5,18,3,JACK,Alright how the hell do I know?
5,18,3,MORTY,"Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me."
5,18,3,JACK,I thought you're going to Paris
5,18,3,MORTY,I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.
5,18,3,JACK,What's in the boxes?
5,18,3,MORTY,Raincoats.
5,18,3,JACK,Raincoats? You think you're gonna sell those old crappy raincoats? That's garbage.
5,18,3,HELEN,I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.
5,18,3,JACK,When do you want these?
5,18,3,MORTY,Send them tomorrow.
5,18,5,ESTELLE,You think they're coming tonight?
5,18,5,GEORGE,I dunno they said maybe.
5,18,5,FRANK,"Of course they're coming, they're leaving soon. If they don't come tonight they might not see us."
5,18,5,ESTELLE,"Well they better come, I got all this Paella."
5,18,5,FRANK,"I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, maybe a cruise."
5,18,5,GEORGE,"Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you."
5,18,5,ESTELLE,Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night?
5,18,5,GEORGE,
5,18,5,ESTELLE,I heard noise.
5,18,5,GEORGE,Maybe it was a mouse.
5,18,5,FRANK,
5,18,5,GEORGE,What?
5,18,5,FRANK,I will not tolerate infestation.
5,18,5,GEORGE,You haven't even seen one.
5,18,5,FRANK,"Don't you understand the very thought, the very idea, I'll never be comfortable again."
5,18,5,ESTELLE,All right Frank that's enough.
5,18,8,GEORGE,I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldn't accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever
5,18,8,RUDY,Uh huh.
5,18,8,GEORGE,They will get a good home won't they?
5,18,8,RUDY,Look I gotta be honest with you there's nothing here too spectacular.
5,18,8,GEORGE,"Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a Casanova really."
5,18,8,RUDY,I'll give you uh two-hundred dollars for the three boxes.
5,18,8,GEORGE,Could you make it two-twenty-five that was his hi-game in bowling.
5,18,8,RUDY,Yea I'm in a good mood here.
5,18,8,GEORGE,Thank you.
5,18,9,KRAMER,"Hey, George what are you doing here?"
5,18,9,GEORGE,"Uh, I'm just selling some of Dad's things, that's what he would have wanted."
5,18,9,KRAMER,"Oh, I gotcha"
5,18,9,GEORGE,That'll do.
5,18,9,KRAMER,"Oh hey guess what. Morty Seinfeld and I are going into business together, selling raincoats."
5,18,9,GEORGE,Hey that's swell.
5,18,9,KRAMER,Yea we worked it out all over dinner last night.
5,18,9,GEORGE,Dinner?
5,18,9,KRAMER,Ya.
5,18,9,GEORGE,You had dinner with the Seinfelds?
5,18,9,KRAMER,"Yea, last night."
5,18,9,GEORGE,Was this something you had planned for a while?
5,18,9,KRAMER,No it was a spur of the moment. Well you know Morty likes to fly by the seat of his vintage pants.
5,18,9,GEORGE,"They had plans, They had plans!"
5,18,9,KRAMER,"Oooo, boy I've never seen these before"
5,18,9,RUDY,"Well they just came in, part of my spring-time cruise collection. Two for twenty-five dollars."
5,18,9,KRAMER,Oh I'll take these.
5,18,9,RUDY,All right
5,18,9,KRAMER,"Hey, remember this raincoat that you sold me?"
5,18,9,RUDY,Sure that's the Executive.
5,18,9,KRAMER,"Ya, you have any others?"
5,18,9,RUDY,I wish. They don't make 'em anymore.
5,18,9,KRAMER,"Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be interested?"
5,18,9,RUDY,Very interested
5,18,9,KRAMER,Cuz they're coming in from Florida as we speak.
5,18,9,RUDY,Well bring 'em in.
5,18,9,KRAMER,So you'll buy them?
5,18,9,RUDY,I don't see what would possibly stop me.
5,18,12,GEORGE,Aaaa aaaa Ah ha. They had plans huh? They were busy. They were busy with their big plans!
5,18,12,JERRY,What are you talking about?
5,18,12,GEORGE,Mom and Pop Seinfeld
5,18,12,JERRY,Look I don't know.
5,18,12,GEORGE,"All right I happen to know what they did last night, they had dinner with Kramer."
5,18,12,JERRY,Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing.
5,18,12,GEORGE,So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents?
5,18,12,JERRY,That's right.
5,18,12,GEORGE,Is there something wrong with my parents?
5,18,12,JERRY,Absolutely
5,18,12,GEORGE,Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people.
5,18,12,JERRY,These the people you currently live with?
5,18,12,GEORGE,Yes.
5,18,12,JERRY,Uh huh
5,18,12,GEORGE,So are they coming tonight or not?
5,18,12,JERRY,Look I really don't know what they're plans are.
5,18,12,GEORGE,"Ok, fine. It's going to be very interesting, very interesting if they don't show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella."
5,18,12,JERRY,What is that anyway?
5,18,12,GEORGE,"It's a Spanish dish. It's a m√©lange of fish, an meat with rice. Very tasty."
5,18,12,JERRY,I-I'll tell 'em
5,18,12,GEORGE,Hey could you do one other thing for me?
5,18,12,JERRY,Name it.
5,18,12,GEORGE,You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them? It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris. Is that a coincidence? Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going
5,18,12,JERRY,"So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?"
5,18,12,GEORGE,All right if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.
5,18,14,JOANNE,So where's he taking you?
5,18,14,ELAINE,"Well first we're going to a matinee, I'm taking the afternoon off, we're gonna go see ""My Fair Lady"" and they we are gonna go to dinner. He knows all these fantastic places."
5,18,14,JOANNE,You are one lucky girl. Wish I could find a nice guy. Hi Aaron.
5,18,14,AARON,Hey Joanne. Hey

5,18,18,ELAINE,"Oh, Great."

5,18,18,AARON,We can make a whole day of it.
5,18,18,MORTY,"This is some building, Harry Fleming used to have an office here. There was a deli on the first floor. You don't get corned beef like that anymore. What happened to that deli?"
5,18,18,ELAINE,I really don't know Mr. Seinfeld
5,18,22,JERRY,We better not. T-They're gonna be here any second.

5,18,23,JERRY,Oh Elaine really? Well that sounds interesting.
5,18,23,MORTY,We saw Regis Philbin get out of a limousine.
5,18,23,JERRY,Oh.

5,18,26,JACK,There is something wrong with the key. The key doesn't work
5,18,26,MORTY,You gotta jiggle it a little bit. I jiggled it. I jiggled it for fifteen minutes.
5,18,27,DORIS,Tell him to come down here and get his own packages. You have nothing better to do then worry about his boxes.
5,18,27,MORTY,You gotta pull on the knob as you turn it.
5,18,27,JACK,Get the hell outta here with your knob.
5,18,27,DORIS,What does he want from you?
5,18,27,MORTY,My idiot son could open that garage door.
5,18,27,JERRY,What did I do?

5,18,30,FRANK,"First Kramer, then Elaine?"
5,18,30,GEORGE,Yea
5,18,30,FRANK,It's a slap in the face.
5,18,30,ESTELLE,What did we ever do to them? I want to know what we did them!
5,18,30,FRANK,"What are they too good for us? A raincoat salesman, I could buy and sell 'em like that."
5,18,31,ESTELLE,The hell with them.
5,18,31,GEORGE,"The thing that bothers me the most, is the lying."
5,18,32,FRANK,Let's forget about it. We're going on a beautiful vacation.
5,18,32,GEORGE,Vacation?
5,18,32,FRANK,You're mother and I are planning on taking a cruise.
5,18,33,FRANK,But I can't find any vacation clothes. They were in the attic.
5,18,33,GEORGE,The attic? Y-you haven't wore any of those clothes for years.
5,18,33,FRANK,"How can I go on a cruise with out my cabana wear? I love those, those clothes. AH! A mouse! I saw a mouse!"
5,18,33,GEORGE,It's the remote.
5,18,33,FRANK,Where the hell are my clothes? I love those clothes.
5,18,35,RUDY,Lousy moth ridden crap.
5,18,41,JERRY,Hey.
5,18,41,MORTY,"Hey, Jerry."
5,18,41,HELEN,So how was the movie?
5,18,41,JERRY,"Oh, really good, really good."
5,18,41,HELEN,And didn't the three hours go by just like that
5,18,41,JERRY,Like that
5,18,41,MORTY,"What about the end, with the list?"
5,18,41,JERRY,Ya that was some list.
5,18,41,HELEN,What did you think about the black and white?
5,18,41,JERRY,The black and white.
5,18,41,MORTY,The whole movie was in black and white.
5,18,41,JERRY,"Oh yea, I didn't even realize."
5,18,41,MORTY,"You don't even think about it, there's so much going on."
5,18,41,JERRY,"Ya ya, I tell ya I could see it again."
5,18,42,KRAMER,"So Klompus has the key, but the jerk couldn't open it up. All you gotta do it jiggle it jus get it in there jigg jigg jiggle reiggle"
5,18,42,RUDY,"Look, I find this whole thing very uninteresting. When you get the coats come in."
5,18,44,KRAMER,Hey what again?
5,18,44,GEORGE,I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella.
5,18,44,KRAMER,"Payaya, ya I'll be there."
5,18,44,GEORGE,Apparently the Seinfelds' are too good for us. I shouldn't say anything bad about your uh your partner.
5,18,44,KRAMER,No no you know we're not partners. I only get twenty-five percent.
5,18,44,GEORGE,Twenty-five percent? It was your idea.
5,18,44,KRAMER,Yap I know.
5,18,44,GEORGE,You're doing all the leg work.
5,18,44,KRAMER,That's right
5,18,44,GEORGE,He's ripping you off
5,18,44,KRAMER,You're right he's ripping me off
5,18,44,GEORGE,If anybody should be getting more it's you.
5,18,44,KRAMER,He's ripping me off
5,18,44,GEORGE,Well don't let him take advantage of you like that.
5,18,44,RUDY,Oh it's you? You're the one who sold me the moth ridden cabana crap.
5,18,46,MORTY,"You know I've been thinking, why is Kramer getting twenty-five percent?"
5,18,46,HELEN,Well he told you about the place.
5,18,46,MORTY,"So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finders fee. You know what a finders fee is?"
5,18,46,HELEN,You find something you get a fee.
5,18,46,MORTY,Finder's fee is ten percent and no more.
5,18,46,HELEN,Well it's too late now.
5,18,46,MORTY,"Those are my coats. I saved them, I stored them, I've been waiting years for this pay off."
5,18,46,HELEN,Well you're not gonna say anything.
5,18,47,KRAMER,I've been thinking about something.
5,18,47,MORTY,Ya so have I
5,18,47,KRAMER,Ahh! I don't think the deal is fair.
5,18,47,MORTY,You don't think it's fair.
5,18,47,KRAMER,"No no, I found the place, I set the whole thing up, I'm doing all the leg work."
5,18,47,MORTY,What leg work?
5,18,47,KRAMER,"Oh, there's leg work."
5,18,47,MORTY,If anything you're getting too much.
5,18,47,KRAMER,Too much?!
5,18,47,MORTY,"That's right, they're my coats."
5,18,47,KRAMER,Look I want thirty-five percent.
5,18,47,MORTY,I'm thinking more like fifteen.
5,18,47,KRAMER,No way I'm taking fifteen.
5,18,47,MORTY,Well you're not getting thirty-five.
5,18,47,KRAMER,Alright let's compromise. Twenty-five percent.
5,18,47,MORTY,Ok it's a deal
5,18,49,RUDY,"Moths are a discourage to my business, all it takes is one moth to lay eggs. You know what happens to the larvae? They hatch and they're everywhere."
5,18,49,GEORGE,"I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back I-I-I'll have the clothes."
5,18,49,RUDY,It's already put a dent in my fumigation bill.
5,18,49,GEORGE,So uh where are the clothes?
5,18,49,RUDY,I burned 'em.
5,18,49,GEORGE,Oh. That's good.
5,18,51,ELAINE,
5,18,51,JERRY,It is a tad askew.
5,18,51,ELAINE,I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it?
5,18,51,JERRY,I've hardly been out to dinner with them.
5,18,51,ELAINE,"See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's really doing is being nice but but nobody is this nice, this is like certifiably nice."
5,18,51,JERRY,You're right he's insane.
5,18,51,ELAINE,"Yes, he's insane, that's what I think."
5,18,51,JERRY,So what are you going to do?
5,18,51,ELAINE,"I don't know, I don't know what to do. Oh god.... so how was the movie?"
5,18,51,JERRY,Uh from what I saw it was pretty good.
5,18,51,ELAINE,Ya what do you mean from what you saw?
5,18,51,JERRY,Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie.
5,18,51,ELAINE,Yea why not?
5,18,51,JERRY,I was kind of um making out.
5,18,51,ELAINE,"You were making, out during Schindler's List?"
5,18,51,JERRY,"I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me."
5,18,51,ELAINE,During Schindler's List?
5,18,51,JERRY,We're both living with our parents.
5,18,51,ELAINE,Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything?
5,18,51,JERRY,No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me.
5,18,51,ELAINE,Oh.
5,18,53,NEWMAN,Hello Mrs. Seinfeld
5,18,53,HELEN,"Hello, Newman. Jerry's not here."
5,18,53,NEWMAN,Uh ah Having a nice trip?
5,18,53,HELEN,"Wonderful, we went to the theater last night."
5,18,53,NEWMAN,Oh the theater. Because I was wondering.
5,18,53,HELEN,Wondering what?
5,18,53,NEWMAN,Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry.
5,18,53,HELEN,Well we already saw it.
5,18,53,NEWMAN,"Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go."
5,18,53,MORTY,Why is that?
5,18,53,NEWMAN,Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean.
5,18,53,HELEN,I'm afraid I don't.
5,18,53,NEWMAN,Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony.
5,18,53,MORTY,What?
5,18,53,NEWMAN,"What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland."
5,18,53,HELEN,Jerry was necking during Schindler's List?
5,18,53,NEWMAN,Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just really came up to get some detergent.
5,18,53,HELEN,Jerry sends his laundry out.
5,18,53,NEWMAN,Oh ho right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a by the way you didn't hear this from me. Tata
5,18,56,JERRY,Hi What? What did I do?
5,18,56,HELEN,How could you?
5,18,56,JERRY,How could I what?
5,18,56,HELEN,You were making out during Schindler's List?
5,18,56,JERRY,What? No.
5,18,56,MORTY,Don't lie Jerry.
5,18,56,JERRY,Newman.
5,18,56,HELEN,How could you do such a thing?
5,18,56,JERRY,"I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew, the war was over."
5,18,57,JERRY,Hello.
5,18,58,JACK,"Hello Jerry, it's Jack Klompus."
5,18,58,JERRY,Hang on a second. Dad it's Klompus.
5,18,58,MORTY,Hello
5,18,58,JACK,"Hello Morty, listen that key doesn't work. It's no good."
5,18,58,MORTY,You didn't get in?
5,18,58,JACK,"Oh I got in, I had to break the window with a rock and then I got my hand all cut up reaching in."
5,18,58,MORTY,You broke the window?
5,18,58,HELEN,He broke the window?
5,18,58,JACK,You wanted those damn boxes didn't you?
5,18,58,DORIS,He should be on his hands and knees thanking you.
5,18,58,MORTY,Did you send them?
5,18,58,JACK,"Yea, they'll be there tomorrow afternoon, two o'clock."
5,18,58,MORTY,Tomorrow afternoon?
5,18,58,HELEN,Tomorrow afternoon?
5,18,58,JERRY,Tomorrow afternoon?
5,18,58,MORTY,I told you to send them express.
5,18,58,JACK,"W-well it was ten dollars cheaper in the afternoon than the morning, I figured what the hell's the difference."
5,18,58,MORTY,So what did you do about the window?
5,18,58,JACK,I gotta fix your window now?
5,18,58,MORTY,All right all right. Goodbye. I don't think we are gonna make that flight.
5,18,58,JERRY,W-what do you mean you're not making the flight?
5,18,58,HELEN,"We have to make the flight, we're with a charter group. If we don't the trip is off."
5,18,58,MORTY,Well what's the difference we'll go some place else.
5,18,59,HELEN,Some place else? What about Paris?
5,18,59,MORTY,"You don't understand, I've come this far, I can't stop now."
5,18,59,HELEN,I can't believe that you're doing all this just to sell some stupid raincoats.
5,18,59,MORTY,You don't understand fashion is cyclical this thing could come back.
5,18,59,HELEN,I think you're out of your mind.
5,18,60,FRANK,I just don't understand how all those clothes can disappear.
5,18,60,GEORGE,Moths?
5,18,60,FRANK,"Moths, ate three boxes?"
5,18,60,GEORGE,"Well you know what happens with larvae hatch, they-they're everywhere."

5,18,62,KRAMER,Well Rudy's the guy buying Morty's raincoats.
5,18,62,FRANK,Mory Seinfeld? He's a bum.
5,18,62,KRAMER,"Well, the whole deal going down tomorrow. Morty's gonna miss his plane for it."
5,18,62,GEORGE,Missing his plane? Wasn't that a charter flight?
5,18,62,KRAMER,Yea.
5,18,62,GEORGE,What happens to charter tickets when you don't use em?
5,18,62,KRAMER,Well I suppose they are wasted.
5,18,62,GEORGE,Yes I suppose they are.
5,18,62,FRANK,Tomorrow I'm going straight down to this Rudy and get my clothes.
5,18,62,KRAMER,A mouse!
5,18,65,JERRY,You want the tickets?
5,18,65,GEORGE,Yes.
5,18,65,JERRY,You're gonna take this kid to Paris?

5,18,65,JERRY,You know I'm paying for these tickets.
5,18,65,GEORGE,"It's alright, I got lunch."
5,18,67,KRAMER,"Oh, you should have gone to the Costanzas' for dinner. Mmm the Payaya was magnificent. Have you ever had really good Paella?"
5,18,67,MORTY,Not really.
5,18,67,KRAMER,"Oh it's a orgiastic feast for the senses. The want and the festival, the sites, sounds, and colors an mmmummumm mumm"
5,18,67,JERRY,Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right carousel?
5,18,67,MORTY,This is it.
5,18,67,KRAMER,So how much are we gonna make?
5,18,67,MORTY,"Take it easy, I've been through a million of these negotiations."
5,18,67,KRAMER,Wha two thousand? Three thousand?
5,18,67,MORTY,That's giving it away. This is a one of a kind item.
5,18,67,KRAMER,More? More than three thousand?
5,18,67,MORTY,Just watch me do my thing.
5,18,67,JERRY,"Say Dad, isn't that one of yours?"
5,18,67,MORTY,"Look at this. Look at how this idiot packed it. He didn't tape it, he just flipped the flaps. Kramer you missed a couple."
5,18,67,WOMAN,"Bon-jour, welcome to the Gateway to Paris Charter Flight."
5,18,67,JERRY,Dad isn't that your charter group?
5,18,68,GEORGE,"Honesty, hard-work, these are the values that I was raised on. The most important thing Joey, is to be able to look yourself in the mirror before you go to sleep at night."
5,18,68,JOEY,"Hey! I got news for you four eyes, there's no way you're staying with us in Paris."
5,18,70,FRANK,You burned them? Those clothes are not yours to burn.
5,18,70,RUDY,Who are you anyways?
5,18,70,FRANK,I'm the father.
5,18,70,RUDY,He said his father was dead.
5,18,70,FRANK,He said I was dead?
5,18,70,RUDY,That's right. Squeezed an extra twenty-five dollars out of me.
5,18,70,FRANK,That's what my life is worth to him? Twenty-five dollars.
5,18,71,KRAMER,"Hey, Frank!"
5,18,71,FRANK,"Oh, I just want to you know I'm retracting our dinner invitation."
5,18,71,MORTY,Well you don't have to retract it because we never went.
5,18,71,FRANK,I'm retracting that it was ever offered.
5,18,71,MORTY,I retract your retraction.
5,18,71,FRANK,"Oh, you trying to unload some of that junk of yours?"
5,18,71,MORTY,"Would you excuse me please, we're conducting business here."
5,18,71,RUDY,You can keep your raincoats. I'm not interested.
5,18,71,KRAMER,I thought we had a deal?
5,18,71,FRANK,That's another one of my shirts!!
5,18,71,RUDY,I'm not buying anymore clothes from anyone off the street.
5,18,71,MORTY,Who's off the street? I'm in the raincoat business for thirty-five years.
5,18,71,RUDY,Ya how do I know there aren't moths like his stuff?
5,18,71,FRANK,My clothes don't have moths!
5,18,71,MORTY,Because of his moths you're not buying my raincoats?
5,18,71,RUDY,That's right.

5,18,78,JERRY,"You tried Aaron, it was too expensive."
5,18,78,AARON,"This watch, this watch could've paid for their whole trip. This ring, this ring is one more dinner I could've taken them out to. Water, they need some water"
5,18,78,ELAINE,Why?
5,18,78,AARON,They'll get dehydrated on the plane! Get the Seinfelds some water. Please! Please!
5,18,81,JERRY,Hi Mr. Goldstein is Rachel home?
5,18,81,MR. GOLDSTEIN,"I'm afraid Rachel's not going to be able to see you tonight, or any other night for that matter."
5,18,81,JERRY,Why what did I do?
5,18,81,MR. GOLDSTEIN,"You know very well. I heard about your behavior at the movies the other night it was disgraceful. You should be ashamed of yourself, I for one will not allow my daughter to be involved with someone of such weak moral fiber. Fortunately my postman happened to have witnessed the entire incident. A heavy set fellow, I believe he lives in your building. Now if you don't mind."
5,18,81,JERRY,Rachel!
5,18,81,MR. GOLDSTEIN,Good night!
5,18,81,JERRY,Rachel!
5,18,83,JERRY,"So my parents get home, they open the door, my father flicks the light on, the whole place is cleaned out, everything."
5,18,83,ELAINE,"Aahh, Get Out! How did it happen?"
5,18,83,JERRY,"The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in."
5,18,83,ELAINE,"Oohh, boy. They could use a vacation."
5,18,83,JERRY,"Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something else up for them."
5,18,83,ELAINE,So how about that Aaron?
5,18,83,JERRY,Whew
5,18,83,ELAINE,You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked?
5,18,83,JERRY,No I hadn't noticed.
5,18,84,NEWMAN,Pair of bear claws please.
5,18,84,JERRY,Hiya Newman.
5,18,84,NEWMAN,Hello Jerry.
5,18,84,JERRY,"Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the other night."
5,18,84,NEWMAN,"Ohh, were you there?"

5,18,84,NEWMAN,I-it's a it's a...powerful film.
5,18,84,JERRY,"Yes, shocking brutality don't you think?"
5,18,84,NEWMAN,Shocking.
5,18,84,JERRY,"Yes, well that was nothing."
5,18,85,NEWMAN,Jerry! Jerry!
5,18,88,GEORGE,Where the hell is your father?!
5,18,91,ESTELLE,This is the best thing we ever did.
5,18,91,FRANK,I just hope those exterminators know what they're doing.
5,18,91,ESTELLE,Ah forget about them let's just...
5,18,94,THE END,
