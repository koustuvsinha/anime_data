5,2,0,THE GLASSES,Written by Tom Gammill & Max Pross
5,2,1,JERRY,"I never get enough sleep. I stay up late at night, cause I'm Night Guy. Night Guy wants to stay up late. 'What about getting up after five hours sleep?', oh that's Morning Guy's problem. That's not my problem, I'm Night Guy. I stay up as late as I want. So you get up in the morning, you're ..... , you're exhausted, groggy, oooh I hate that Night Guy! See, Night Guy always screws Morning Guy. There's nothing Morning Guy can do. The only Morning Guy can do is try and oversleep often enough so that Day Guy looses his job and Night Guy has no money to go out anymore."
5,2,3,ELAINE,Do you ever spit on anybody from here?
5,2,3,JERRY,No. You?
5,2,3,ELAINE,No. Do you ever think about it?
5,2,3,JERRY,Yeah.
5,2,3,ELAINE,Me too.
5,2,4,KRAMER,Hey.
5,2,4,JERRY,Hey.
5,2,4,KRAMER,Well I got it!
5,2,4,JERRY,You got me the air conditioner?
5,2,4,KRAMER,What do you think?
5,2,4,JERRY,Beautiful!
5,2,4,ELAINE,What air conditioner?
5,2,4,KRAMER,My buddy works in an appliance store and he got us thirty percent off.
5,2,4,JERRY,Is it a good one?
5,2,4,KRAMER,Good one? It's the Commando 8.
5,2,4,JERRY,Commando 8?
5,2,4,KRAMER,12.000 BTU's.
5,2,4,ELAINE,I thought you hated air conditioning. You've never had an air conditioner.
5,2,4,KRAMER,"Yeah, but Amy likes air conditioning."
5,2,4,ELAINE,"Oooh, you're getting an air conditioner for Amy. Amy doesn't like the temperature up here. She's a little hoooot."
5,2,4,JERRY,All right.
5,2,4,KRAMER,"Okay, so, I'm gonna measure the window up, okay buddy?"
5,2,4,JERRY,Yeah.
5,2,4,KRAMER,Yeah.
5,2,5,KRAMER,"Yeah, rock on!"
5,2,6,GEORGE,I gotta get out of this city.
5,2,6,JERRY,So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth?
5,2,6,GEORGE,"I'm at the health club and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses?"
5,2,6,ELAINE,You don't have an old pair?
5,2,6,GEORGE,I broke 'em playing basketball.
5,2,6,JERRY,He was running from a bee.
5,2,6,GEORGE,Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these.
5,2,6,ELAINE,"George, those are prescription goggles? What is there to see in a health club pool?"
5,2,6,JERRY,There's a lot of change down there.
5,2,6,GEORGE,"When I find that guy, this much I vow: those glasses will be returned to their rightful owner."
5,2,6,JERRY,"We're behind you, Aquaboy. Godspeed!"
5,2,7,GEORGE,"What kind of a sick, demented person wants another person's glasses?"
5,2,7,ELAINE,"Yeah, especially those frames."
5,2,7,KRAMER,You know you ought to do? Go see my friend Dwayne at J & T Optical and Columbus Avenue. He'll give you thirty percent off.
5,2,7,GEORGE,"Yeah, come on."
5,2,7,JERRY,"Hey, he just got me thirty percent off on an air conditioner."
5,2,7,GEORGE,Really?
5,2,7,KRAMER,Retail is for suckers.
5,2,7,GEORGE,Wow. What do I have to do?
5,2,7,KRAMER,You just gotta mention my name.
5,2,7,GEORGE,That's it?
5,2,7,KRAMER,That's it.
5,2,9,GEORGE,What about these?
5,2,9,ELAINE,They look good. I liked the other one too. I've liked about five of them.
5,2,9,GEORGE,It's a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. I'm deciding on a new face.
5,2,9,JERRY,"Come on, George. Pick a face and go with it!"
5,2,9,ELAINE,"Now those look good, they're very bold."
5,2,9,GEORGE,"Yes, they are bold. Jerry, what do you think?"
5,2,9,JERRY,I think these women would be pretty good looking if they weren't wearing glasses.
5,2,10,ELAINE,"Hi there, little doggy. Do you mind if I pet your dog?"
5,2,10,DOG OWNER,It's okay with me.
5,2,10,ELAINE,Hey little doggy.
5,2,11,ELAINE,Aaah!
5,2,11,DWAYNE,"Hey, you can't have that dog in here."
5,2,12,JERRY,Are you okay? Did he bite you?
5,2,12,GEORGE,Can you believe that guy?
5,2,12,ELAINE,"I'm okay, it's just a nick."
5,2,12,GEORGE,He just walked away! And once again I'm standing here like a little man. Well not this time!
5,2,13,GEORGE,You! Dog man!
5,2,14,ELAINE,My leg looks pretty bad.
5,2,14,JERRY,Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room.
5,2,14,ELAINE,Okay.
5,2,14,JERRY,"Hey, any luck? Did you catch 'em?"
5,2,14,GEORGE,"Uuh, no."
5,2,14,JERRY,"All right, I'm gonna take Elaine over to the hospital."
5,2,14,GEORGE,"Good, good, do that."
5,2,14,JERRY,What's the matter?
5,2,14,GEORGE,"Oh, no, nothing."
5,2,14,JERRY,What is it?
5,2,14,GEORGE,I can't tell you.
5,2,14,ELAINE,"Jerry, can we go?"
5,2,14,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second. What do you mean you can't tell me?"
5,2,14,GEORGE,"I can't tell you, don't ask."
5,2,14,JERRY,I'm asking!
5,2,14,ELAINE,"Jerry, my leg."
5,2,14,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah, take care."
5,2,15,JERRY,"Come on, George, what is it?"
5,2,15,GEORGE,I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey.
5,2,15,JERRY,What?
5,2,15,GEORGE,They were right outside!
5,2,15,JERRY,Amy and Jeffrey?
5,2,15,GEORGE,Yes!
5,2,15,JERRY,Are you sure?
5,2,15,GEORGE,"Yes, positive."
5,2,15,JERRY,"But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames."
5,2,15,GEORGE,I know! I was squinting.
5,2,15,ELAINE,"Listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow the trail of blood."
5,2,15,JERRY,We're gonna have to talk about this later.
5,2,16,JERRY,Thank you. Taxi!
5,2,18,GEORGE,"Excuse me, what do you think of these?"
5,2,18,DWAYNE,"Oh, we just got those in. It's a very exciting new frame."
5,2,18,GEORGE,"Yes, it is exciting! All right, this is gonna be my new face."
5,2,18,DWAYNE,"All right, you have a prescription?"
5,2,18,GEORGE,Yeah.
5,2,19,GEORGE,Kramer...
5,2,19,DWAYNE,What?
5,2,19,GEORGE,Kramer...
5,2,19,DWAYNE,What about him?
5,2,19,GEORGE,You do know Kramer?
5,2,19,DWAYNE,Yes...
5,2,19,GEORGE,"Well, I'm mentioning his name."
5,2,19,DWAYNE,Why?
5,2,19,GEORGE,Because... you know...
5,2,19,DWAYNE,"No, I don't know. Look, I'm gonna need a deposit on these."
5,2,20,ELAINE,"Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible!"
5,2,20,JERRY,"Why not? They could have met. She loves the park, he works for the Parks Department."
5,2,20,ELAINE,"Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses on!"
5,2,20,JERRY,But he was squinting.
5,2,20,ELAINE,So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.
5,2,20,JERRY,"Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road!"
5,2,20,DOCTER,Okay.
5,2,20,ELAINE,Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot?
5,2,20,DOCTER,"Not shot, dog bite."
5,2,20,ELAINE,"No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?"
5,2,20,DOCTER,"Not shot, dog bite. Woof woof, not bang bang."
5,2,22,JERRY,"Now, look at this. Cable's out."
5,2,22,AMY,"Oh that's okay, we don't have to watch tv."
5,2,22,JERRY,"No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing."
5,2,23,JERRY,"I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not... getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?"
5,2,23,AMY,Yesterday?
5,2,23,JERRY,"Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out."
5,2,23,AMY,I didn't do anything.
5,2,23,JERRY,Oh you must have done something.
5,2,23,AMY,"No, nothing really."
5,2,23,JERRY,Didn't go out of the house? Didn't take a walk... on Columbus Avenue?
5,2,23,AMY,"Well, I did go out for a little while."
5,2,23,JERRY,"Well, your day's getting more interesting already."
5,2,24,JERRY,"Ah, see, told me they'd be back in a minute and THEY lied."
5,2,24,AMY,You can't thrust anyone.
5,2,24,JERRY,"No you can't. Now let's cut the ball, sister! You think I don't know about you swapping spit with somebody yesterday on Columbus Avenue?"
5,2,24,AMY,What are you talking about?
5,2,24,JERRY,"Look, my friend saw you."
5,2,24,AMY,Saw me? With who?
5,2,24,JERRY,You tell me.
5,2,24,AMY,There's nothing to tell.
5,2,24,JERRY,There isn't?
5,2,24,AMY,No.
5,2,24,JERRY,Oh... all right... wanna get some pizza?
5,2,25,AMY,I had a feeling this was to good to be true.
5,2,25,JERRY,Why?
5,2,25,AMY,I knew there had to be another side to you.
5,2,25,JERRY,"No, no, there's no side!"
5,2,25,AMY,"There is a side, an ugly side."
5,2,25,JERRY,"No, no, no ugly side."
5,2,25,AMY,"Look, I think I'm gonna go."
5,2,25,JERRY,Why?
5,2,25,AMY,It's really hot in here.
5,2,25,JERRY,"Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?"
5,2,25,AMY,Yeah. When are you getting an air conditioner?
5,2,25,JERRY,It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat locker in here.
5,2,26,JERRY,I was an idiot for listening to you!
5,2,26,GEORGE,"Hey, I saw what I saw."
5,2,26,JERRY,"Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me. Now she sees a side."
5,2,26,GEORGE,What side?
5,2,26,JERRY,"A bad side, an ugly side."
5,2,26,GEORGE,"Ooh, so what?"
5,2,26,JERRY,So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve.
5,2,26,GEORGE,Why don't you just ask Jeffrey?
5,2,26,JERRY,"Ah, he'd just deny it."
5,2,26,GEORGE,There must be some way to find out.
5,2,26,JERRY,Amy said nothing happened.
5,2,26,GEORGE,"What, you're gonna take her word over mine? I'm your best friend!"
5,2,26,JERRY,"Yeah, but you're blind as a bat!"
5,2,26,GEORGE,I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? I was spotting those raccoons.
5,2,26,JERRY,"They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you."
5,2,26,GEORGE,"Hey look, a dime."
5,2,27,GEORGE,Mercury head. You mind?
5,2,27,JERRY,"No, keep it."
5,2,28,JERRY,Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago.
5,2,28,ELAINE,There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't come in until he left.
5,2,28,JERRY,A little white dog?
5,2,28,ELAINE,Yeah.
5,2,28,JERRY,Snowball? You were afraid of Snowball?
5,2,28,ELAINE,I'm afraid of dogs now.
5,2,28,JERRY,He's like a squirrel.
5,2,28,ELAINE,Well he frightened me.
5,2,28,GEORGE,Did you get the shot?
5,2,28,ELAINE,No. He said I didn't need a shot.
5,2,28,GEORGE,You got bit by a strange dog and you didn't get a rabies shot?
5,2,28,ELAINE,"What, you think I should have?"
5,2,29,JERRY,"You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog."
5,2,29,ELAINE,"All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that."
5,2,30,KRAMER,The AC is on his way.
5,2,30,GEORGE,"Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne... there was no discount."
5,2,30,KRAMER,What?
5,2,30,GEORGE,"That's right, no discount!"
5,2,30,KRAMER,Well did you mention my name?
5,2,30,GEORGE,"Yes, I mentioned your name."
5,2,30,KRAMER,And?
5,2,30,GEORGE,Bubkis!
5,2,30,KRAMER,"Now I don't believe this. That guy owes me big time. I got him off sugar! Look, I'm gonna go down there with you right now."
5,2,30,GEORGE,"All right, let me just... I'm gonna grap an apple."
5,2,30,JERRY,"Hey, Kramer, Elaine's afraid of Snowball!"
5,2,30,KRAMER,Little Snowball? He runs on batteries!
5,2,31,ELAINE,"You know, George, that's an union."
5,2,31,GEORGE,Yes it is.
5,2,32,ELAINE,He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness?
5,2,32,GEORGE,"I saw them making out, you can believe it."
5,2,32,JERRY,"I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on."
5,2,32,KRAMER,"Look, all you gotta to is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's it."
5,2,32,JERRY,"Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy. All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody time."
5,2,32,KRAMER,"Right this way, mister Doody!"
5,2,32,GEORGE,You'll see I'm right.
5,2,33,KRAMER,"Hey, Dwayny."
5,2,33,DWAYNE,Oh hello Kramer.
5,2,33,KRAMER,What is going on here?
5,2,33,DWAYNE,What are you talking about?
5,2,33,KRAMER,I'm talking about the thirty percent discount.
5,2,33,ELAINE,Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...
5,2,33,GEORGE,"Elaine, don't interrupt, they're discounting something."
5,2,33,DWAYNE,Who said anything about a discount.
5,2,33,KRAMER,"Ooh, how quickly we forget. You owe me buddy."
5,2,33,DWAYNE,For what?
5,2,34,KRAMER,Remember this?
5,2,34,DWAYNE,What are you doing?
5,2,34,KRAMER,Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar?
5,2,34,DWAYNE,Put that away!
5,2,34,KRAMER,"Remember that night I found you at Dinky Donuts? You were all hopped up on cinnamon swirls! They wouldn't serve you anymore! You wouldn't even have any teeth if it wasn't for me taking you over to Joe's fruit stand and stuff a cantaloupe down your throat! So much for gratitude... yeah, yeah, yeah!"
5,2,34,DWAYNE,"All right, all right, all right! I'll give him the discount, just put that thing away! This squares us."
5,2,34,ELAINE,Can I just have the name...
5,2,34,DWAYNE,Out!
5,2,34,KRAMER,We'll see you Dwayne.
5,2,36,JERRY,"I don't know what to tell you, Elton."
5,2,36,ELAINE,"Oh oh, listen to this, this is not good, listen to these symptoms for rabies: anxiety, irritability. I got those, I'm irritable!"
5,2,36,JERRY,Who picked these out?
5,2,36,GEORGE,I did!
5,2,36,JERRY,They're ladies' glasses! All you need is that little chain around your neck so you can wear 'em while you're playing Canasta.
5,2,36,GEORGE,Well Elaine was supposed to help me.
5,2,37,ELAINE,Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding to death! I can't solve every little problem you have!
5,2,37,JERRY,"Hey, hey."
5,2,37,ELAINE,I'm sorry... sorry.
5,2,38,KRAMER,Commando 8 has arrived!
5,2,38,JERRY,Take it to the window.
5,2,38,KRAMER,12.000 BTU's of raw cooling power.
5,2,39,KRAMER,Installed!
5,2,39,GEORGE,That's it? You don't have to screw it in or anything?
5,2,39,KRAMER,"No, just plug it in and the Commando 8 does the rest. I'll seal that up later, right?"
5,2,39,JERRY,Just in time for Amy.
5,2,39,GEORGE,"Oh yeah, when are you gonna execute that plead?"
5,2,39,ELAINE,"I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom!"
5,2,39,KRAMER,Of what?
5,2,39,JERRY,Rabies.
5,2,39,KRAMER,"Oh that's fatal, you don't want that!"
5,2,40,ELAINE,"I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want, you stupid hipster dufus!"
5,2,40,JERRY,"Hey, hey, what is this? What's going on here?"
5,2,40,ELAINE,"I'm sorry, Kramer, I'm sorry."
5,2,40,KRAMER,"No, no, it's all right. I had a friend who had rabies once."
5,2,41,KRAMER,"May I have one of those, madam?"
5,2,41,GEORGE,Madame? What are you calling me madam for?
5,2,41,KRAMER,They're ladies' glasses.
5,2,42,KRAMER,"Now look here, see it's right here: Gloria Vanderbilt Collection."
5,2,42,GEORGE,He sold me ladies' glasses!
5,2,42,ELAINE,
5,2,42,KRAMER,"She's got rabies, just like my friend Bob Sacamano. She's delirious."
5,2,43,KRAMER,She's foaming at the mouth!
5,2,44,ELAINE,Is this gonna hurt?
5,2,44,DOCTER,"Yes, very much."
5,2,46,ELAINE,What if Jeffrey's not home. Did you ever think of that?
5,2,46,JERRY,"Oh he'll be home, it's Friday night. That's the big night on the Nature Channel."
5,2,46,ELAINE,Let me tell you this: there is no way cousin Jeffrey is dating Amy. He looks like a horse!
5,2,46,JERRY,He does look like a horse.
5,2,46,ELAINE,"Yeah, he's got a real horse face. Here, look at this! It's the guy with the dog! Hey! You down there! Remember me? I had to get shot because of your stupid dog!"
5,2,46,DOG OWNER,Who are you calling stupid?
5,2,46,JERRY,"Hey, shall we spit on him?"
5,2,46,ELAINE,"No no no no, come on, let's go downstairs."
5,2,47,KRAMER,Oh myyyy papayaaaa.
5,2,48,KRAMER,The air conditioner!
5,2,49,KRAMER,I think it got the dog!
5,2,50,GEORGE,Oh boy.
5,2,50,BLIND MAN,"Excuse me, I'm new here, would you mind walking me back to my locker?"
5,2,50,GEORGE,"Oh uuh, sure, hang on. Hey, that's the guy."
5,2,50,BLIND MAN,What guy?
5,2,50,GEORGE,The guy that stole my glasses. This time I got 'em!
5,2,51,GEORGE,Would you pick it up a little?
5,2,51,BLIND MAN,Where the hell are we going?
5,2,51,GEORGE,"He's getting on a bus, damn! Those are nice glasses."
5,2,51,BLIND MAN,"I don't like 'em, they pinch my nose."
5,2,51,GEORGE,Is that really?
5,2,53,GEORGE,"Dwayne, my friend and I would like to exchange frames. Could you put his lenses in my frames and mine in his?"
5,2,53,DWAYNE,"Yeah, we can do that."
5,2,53,GEORGE,And I'd like a discount.
5,2,53,DWAYNE,Why should I give you a discount.
5,2,53,GEORGE,"Listen, you're lucking I'm not asking for a refund. You gave me ladies' frames!"
5,2,53,BLIND MAN,What's that about ladies' frames?
5,2,54,DOG OWNER,"I'm trying to track down that lady that was in here the other day, the one that was messing with my dog."
5,2,54,GEORGE,"Yeah, well, she's trying to track you down."
5,2,54,DOG OWNER,"Well I would love to talk with her. She lives on 81st Street, right?"
5,2,54,GEORGE,"No, that's Jerry."
5,2,54,DOG OWNER,"Really? You wouldn't happen to know what apartment he's in, would you?"
5,2,54,GEORGE,"Yeah, 5A!"
5,2,54,DOG OWNER,Thanks a lot!
5,2,55,AMY,So what are we doing here?
5,2,55,JERRY,"Oh, you'll find out."
5,2,55,AMY,"I don't know, you're acting very mysteriously."
5,2,55,JERRY,"Well, I'm very mysterious by nature."
5,2,56,JERRY,A lot of women find that attractive.
5,2,56,AMY,I find it annoying.
5,2,56,JERRY,Really?
5,2,57,UNCLE LEO,Helloooo!
5,2,57,JERRY,Uncle Leo!
5,2,57,UNCLE LEO,Come on in.
5,2,57,JERRY,This is Amy.
5,2,57,UNCLE LEO,Hello Amy.
5,2,57,JERRY,"Unlce Leo, what are you doing here?"
5,2,57,UNCLE LEO,Jeffrey went out tonight.
5,2,57,JERRY,Ooh! Very convenient.
5,2,57,UNCLE LEO,"I'm supposed to tape this nature show for him, he loves nature. Botany, zoology. You know his botany teacher from college stays in close touch with him? They became friends!"
5,2,57,JERRY,Oh really?
5,2,57,UNCLE LEO,"That's pretty rare! I mean, actual friends! Like equals! They have dinner together, they have discussings..."
5,2,57,JERRY,Uncle Leo! Did he leave any tickets here for me?
5,2,57,UNCLE LEO,"Oh yeah yeah, I'll get 'em."
5,2,57,JERRY,Thank you.
5,2,57,AMY,What tickets?
5,2,57,JERRY,To the Paul Simon concert in the park!
5,2,57,AMY,We're going to the Paul Simon concert?
5,2,57,JERRY,"That's right, lady!"
5,2,57,AMY,Oh what a great surprise!
5,2,57,JERRY,I thought you'd like that.
5,2,57,AMY,"Oooh, that's why you've been acting so mysteriously."
5,2,57,JERRY,"Now you know. That, and that alone, is the reason."
5,2,57,UNCLE LEO,Hear Jeffrey's favorite animal: the leopard.
5,2,57,AMY,Why is that?

5,2,57,UNCLE LEO,What are you talking about? All he meant was that he was sorry that the seats aren't very good.

5,2,62,JERRY,I still don't know how you spotted that dime. I think you planted it. Plus I've got to pay that vet bill for the stupid dog. I don't know how that guy got my name.
