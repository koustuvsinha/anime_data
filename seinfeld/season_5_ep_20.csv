5,20,12,KRAMER,"All right, get off at the next exit."
5,20,12,JERRY,"Kramer, I've driven to the Hamptons many times, I know the exit."
5,20,12,KRAMER,"It's a great house, pool's something? Yeah, I'll be there."
5,20,12,JERRY,You sure we're makin' the right move?
5,20,12,ELAINE,"We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in"
5,20,13,JERRY,Didn't they just have a baby?
5,20,13,ELAINE,"That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see the"
5,20,14,JERRY,Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit
5,20,15,KRAMER,"Hey Jerry, you ever wear silk underwear?"
5,20,15,JERRY,No.
5,20,15,KRAMER,Put that on the top of your list.
5,20,15,JERRY,"No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane"
5,20,16,ELAINE,"Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but"
5,20,17,JERRY,"I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a"
5,20,18,ELAINE,When's Rachel comin' out?
5,20,18,JERRY,She's makin' the three o'clock train.
5,20,18,ELAINE,"Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting you"
5,20,19,JERRY,I bought him some kishka.
5,20,19,KRAMER,What's that?
5,20,19,JERRY,It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In
5,20,20,GEORGE,I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.
5,20,20,JANE,Me too. I love cough medicine.
5,20,20,GEORGE,You see? We were made for each other. It's
5,20,23,JANE,What's your favorite?
5,20,23,GEORGE,Potussan. Ever try it with club soda?
5,20,23,JANE,No.
5,20,23,GEORGE,"Oh, very refreshing. Sex is like joining a"
5,20,25,JANE,Are we almost there?
5,20,25,GEORGE,"Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at a"
5,20,26,JANE,What for?
5,20,26,GEORGE,My mother loves Hampton tomatoes. She's nuts for Hampton tomatoes.
5,20,26,JANE,Can you buy 'em later? I really wanna get some... sun.
5,20,26,KRAMER,Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back.
5,20,26,JERRY,"Who are you, Mrs. Robinson?"
5,20,26,KRAMER,"Come on, I'll rub some on yours."
5,20,26,JERRY,"No, that's no sweet'ning the deal. No."
5,20,26,GEORGE,"You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar and"
5,20,27,JANE,You must've been excited.
5,20,27,GEORGE,"Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You wanna go"
5,20,28,JANE,I don't think so.
5,20,28,GEORGE,"'Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes?"
5,20,28,JERRY,No thanks.
5,20,28,KRAMER,No.
5,20,28,JANE,"I'm gonna take a dip. (She leaves for beach, Elaine enters"
5,20,29,JERRY,And then there's Mog.
5,20,29,ELAINE,"Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?"
5,20,29,JERRY,No lines.
5,20,29,ELAINE,You know why? One word: shade.
5,20,29,JERRY,So when're we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous event?
5,20,29,ELAINE,I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.
5,20,29,KRAMER,"I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine, you"
5,20,30,ELAINE,No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends.
5,20,30,JERRY,Oh this is interesting.
5,20,30,ELAINE,What?
5,20,30,JERRY,Jane's topless.
5,20,30,KRAMER,Yo yo ma.
5,20,30,JERRY,Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
5,20,30,ELAINE,Nice rack.
5,20,30,CAROL,"Come on, you guys. You can come on and see the bay-bee!"
5,20,30,JERRY,"Oh, in a minute, Carol."
5,20,30,KRAMER,We're gonna be right there.
5,20,30,JERRY,This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.
5,20,30,ELAINE,Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?
5,20,30,KRAMER,Maybe she's trying to create a buzz.
5,20,30,ELAINE,What?
5,20,30,KRAMER,"You know, get some good word of mouth goin'."
5,20,30,JERRY,"Oh, here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as Jane"
5,20,31,JANE,I'm thirsty. Anyone want a drink?
5,20,31,JERRY,No thanks.
5,20,31,ELAINE,I'm good.
5,20,31,KRAMER,"Deh-deh-deh-deh- All right, show's over. I'm goin'"
5,20,33,CAROL,"Adam , Jerry and Elaine are here."
5,20,33,ELAINE,"Oh, he's a cute little shnugly baby."
5,20,33,CAROL,"Isn't he gorgeous? (Elaine looks at baby, only to be frightened"
5,20,34,ELAINE,Ugghh.
5,20,34,CAROL,Is she gorgeous?
5,20,34,ELAINE,"Oh, gorgeous, yes."
5,20,34,JERRY,So very gorgeous.
5,20,34,CAROL,"Michael, shut the door! You're letting bugs in."
5,20,36,JERRY,Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?
5,20,36,ELAINE,"Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese."
5,20,36,JERRY,"Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool."
5,20,38,ELAINE,"Oh, you have to lie."
5,20,38,JERRY,It's a must lie situation.
5,20,38,ELAINE,"Yes, it's a must lie situation."
5,20,38,JERRY,"You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless."
5,20,38,ELAINE,"No, I don't think so."
5,20,38,JERRY,"You know, we might want to tell Kramer."
5,20,38,BEN,Oh this ointment should do it.
5,20,38,CAROL,"How are you feeling, Adam? Elaine!"
5,20,39,ELAINE,Hi.
5,20,39,CAROL,"Look at him, Elaine. How gorgeous is he? I ask you, how gorgeous?"
5,20,39,ELAINE,Pretty gorgeous.
5,20,39,BEN,"Elaine, you have children?"
5,20,39,ELAINE,"Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't wait to"
5,20,40,BEN,A beautiful woman like you should. You're quite
5,20,41,ELAINE,Breathtaking? I'm breathtaking?
5,20,41,CAROL,"And he's very particular. Ben, you're staying tonight, right?"
5,20,41,BEN,Sure. (Elaine celebrates to herself as Jerry enters and
5,20,42,JERRY,"Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station."
5,20,42,ELAINE,"Yeah, see ya."
5,20,42,JERRY,Okay.
5,20,42,CAROL,"Oh, just look at him!"
5,20,42,BEN,"Yeah, he really is breathtaking. (Elaine confused by his"
5,20,43,RACHEL,Train was so crowded. I had to sit in the seat facing the wrong
5,20,44,JERRY,Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. (George comes
5,20,45,GEORGE,Hey Rachel!
5,20,45,RACHEL,Hi. I'm gonna go in there to change.
5,20,46,GEORGE,What kind of a greeting was that?
5,20,46,JERRY,She's got greeting problems.
5,20,46,GEORGE,"Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em like"
5,20,47,JERRY,"Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup"
5,20,49,KRAMER,"Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got!"
5,20,49,GEORGE,"Hey! Wow, the K-Man!"
5,20,49,JERRY,You got lobster for everybody?
5,20,49,KRAMER,"Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean."
5,20,49,GEORGE,"This is fantastic. Man, what a weekend. Swimming, lobster for"
5,20,50,KRAMER,"I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless. (Jerry shows that"
5,20,51,GEORGE,"You saw who, what?"
5,20,51,KRAMER,"Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her."
5,20,51,JERRY,All right.
5,20,51,GEORGE,You saw Jane topless?
5,20,51,JERRY,"Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless."
5,20,51,GEORGE,Oh you mean face down on her chest.
5,20,51,JERRY,No.
5,20,51,GEORGE,Face up on her back?
5,20,51,JERRY,Yeah.
5,20,51,GEORGE,Well why'd she do that?
5,20,51,KRAMER,I guess she was hot.
5,20,51,GEORGE,You mean she just laid there topless?
5,20,51,KRAMER,"No, no, she got up, walked around..."
5,20,51,GEORGE,Walked around? And you looked?
5,20,51,KRAMER,"Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm gonna go"
5,20,52,GEORGE,"I can't believe it, you saw her before me."
5,20,52,JERRY,Think of me as a doctor.
5,20,52,GEORGE,"Well, how good a look did you get?"
5,20,52,JERRY,Well what'd you mean?
5,20,52,GEORGE,"Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police"
5,20,53,JERRY,They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.
5,20,53,GEORGE,"Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize her"
5,20,54,JERRY,I guess that's true...
5,20,54,GEORGE,"Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't like"
5,20,55,JERRY,What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?
5,20,55,GEORGE,"Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime."
5,20,55,JERRY,You can see me naked. I can offer you that.
5,20,55,GEORGE,It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and
5,20,56,ELAINE,Nobody ever called me breathtaking before.
5,20,56,JERRY,I've never been called breathtaking either.
5,20,56,ELAINE,"I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not"
5,20,57,JERRY,Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.
5,20,57,ELAINE,"Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out."
5,20,57,JERRY,How are you gonna do that?
5,20,57,ELAINE,I can be very clever.
5,20,57,RACHEL,I'm gonna take a swim.
5,20,57,ELAINE,"Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. (She goes in the hall and sees"
5,20,58,GEORGE,"Oh, okay. (Starts to walk other way and then walks to their room"
5,20,59,RACHEL,Hey!
5,20,59,GEORGE,"Oh, sorry."
5,20,59,RACHEL,Don't you knock?
5,20,59,GEORGE,"I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've never"
5,20,60,JERRY,You might have.
5,20,60,GEORGE,I didn't.
5,20,60,JERRY,You won't.
5,20,60,RACHEL,"What'd you want anyway, George?"
5,20,60,JERRY,"Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you"
5,20,61,GEORGE,"No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum."
5,20,61,JERRY,"Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum."
5,20,61,GEORGE,"Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up."
5,20,61,RACHEL,We don't have any gum.
5,20,61,GEORGE,Okay. Thanks anyway.
5,20,61,RACHEL,Strange man.
5,20,61,JERRY,Wait'll you get to know him.
5,20,61,RACHEL,"So where is this baby, anyway?"
5,20,61,JERRY,"Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so"
5,20,63,RACHEL,"Oh my God! I'm sorry, I thought this was the baby's"
5,20,64,GEORGE,I was in the pool! I was in the pool!
5,20,64,GEORGE,Did she do it on purpose?
5,20,64,JERRY,"It was my fault, I told her the wrong door."
5,20,64,GEORGE,I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.
5,20,64,JERRY,So what?
5,20,64,GEORGE,Well ordinarily I wouldn't mind. But...
5,20,64,JERRY,But...
5,20,64,GEORGE,Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was
5,20,65,JERRY,Oh... You mean... shrinkage.
5,20,65,GEORGE,Yes. Significant shrinkage!
5,20,65,JERRY,So you feel you were short changed.
5,20,65,GEORGE,"Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete"
5,20,66,JERRY,"Well, so what's the difference?"
5,20,66,GEORGE,What if she discusses it with Jane?
5,20,66,JERRY,"Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane."
5,20,66,GEORGE,How do you know?
5,20,66,JERRY,Women aren't like us.
5,20,66,GEORGE,"They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about"
5,20,67,JERRY,"No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think"
5,20,68,GEORGE,How do women know about shrinkage? (They see Elaine walking down
5,20,69,ELAINE,"What do you mean, like laundry?"
5,20,69,GEORGE,No.
5,20,69,JERRY,Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards...
5,20,69,ELAINE,It shrinks?
5,20,69,JERRY,Like a frightened turtle!
5,20,69,ELAINE,Why does it shrink?
5,20,69,GEORGE,It just does.
5,20,69,ELAINE,I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.
5,20,69,MICHAEL,"Thanks for the lobster, Kramer."
5,20,69,KRAMER,"Rachel, aren't you gonna have any?"
5,20,69,RACHEL,"Oh, no, I can't. I'm kosher, we don't eat shellfish."
5,20,69,KRAMER,You mean you've never tasted lobster?
5,20,69,RACHEL,No.
5,20,69,KRAMER,Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when you
5,20,70,CAROL,"Oh, the baby's crying. I'll go get him. He can sit with us."
5,20,70,ELAINE + JERRY,No!
5,20,70,JERRY,"No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable."
5,20,70,ELAINE,"Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun over here."
5,20,71,JERRY,"Yeah, the lobster'll scare him."
5,20,71,CAROL,I'm gonna get him.
5,20,71,GEORGE,"See, look at this. Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much"
5,20,73,ELAINE,"Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science. (Rachel whispers in Jane's"
5,20,74,GEORGE,"What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're you"
5,20,75,JANE,"It's nothing, George."
5,20,75,GEORGE,"You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking"
5,20,76,JANE,What is it with you?
5,20,76,JERRY,Easy big fella.
5,20,76,MICHAEL,"So Kramer, where'd you get all these lobster, at the"
5,20,77,KRAMER,"No, I got 'em in the ocean."
5,20,77,MICHAEL,The ocean? What'd you mean?
5,20,77,KRAMER,"Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all these"
5,20,78,MICHAEL,Those are commercial lobster traps. You can't take those
5,20,79,KRAMER,Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for
5,20,80,MICHAEL,My father was a lobsterman. He got up every morning at
5,20,82,CAROL,Here he is.
5,20,82,KRAMER,Ahhh!
5,20,82,ELAINE,"Some night, huh?"
5,20,82,BEN,"Yeah, I wish I had my telescope."
5,20,82,ELAINE,"Some dinner, huh?"
5,20,82,BEN,Nothing like fresh caught lobster.
5,20,82,ELAINE,"Some house, huh?"
5,20,82,BEN,It was built by Mark Farman.
5,20,82,ELAINE,"Some ugly baby, huh?"
5,20,82,BEN,What did you say?
5,20,82,ELAINE,"I said, uh, some snuggly baby."
5,20,82,BEN,He is something.
5,20,82,ELAINE,"Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised to hear"
5,20,84,BEN,"Well, you know Elaine, sometimes you say things just to be"
5,20,86,JERRY,You told her?
5,20,86,RACHEL,"Yeah, what's the big deal?"
5,20,86,JERRY,"You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic."
5,20,86,RACHEL,"Jerry, what the difference? You know, you're the ones obsessed"
5,20,87,GEORGE,You're going back to New York now?
5,20,87,JANE,"Yeah, I have some things to do."
5,20,87,GEORGE,"Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend Rachel,"
5,20,88,JANE,So what if I did?
5,20,88,GEORGE,And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?
5,20,88,JANE,I don't know what you're talking about.
5,20,88,GEORGE,
5,20,90,JANE,I'm sure it is.
5,20,90,GEORGE,"Look, you don't understand. There was shrinkage."
5,20,91,KRAMER,Looking for this?
5,20,91,RACHEL,"Oh, Kramer! You startled me."
5,20,91,KRAMER,"Well, I thought you might wind up around here."
5,20,91,RACHEL,"Yeah, well, I couldn't stop thinking about how everyone was"
5,20,92,KRAMER,I'm afraid I couldn't do that.
5,20,92,RACHEL,Why not?
5,20,92,KRAMER,"Well, that wouldn't be kosher."
5,20,92,RACHEL,"C'mon, Kramer. I really want to try it."
5,20,92,KRAMER,"Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch."
5,20,92,RACHEL,"Come on, Kramer."
5,20,92,KRAMER,Heyahhh!
5,20,92,RACHEL,I just heard a car drive out. What was that?
5,20,92,JERRY,"Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the"
5,20,93,CAROL,"George, thanks so much for making breakfast."
5,20,93,ELAINE,"George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted."
5,20,93,KRAMER,I didn't know you could cook.
5,20,93,GEORGE,"Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host."
5,20,93,BEN,"Yes, George, the whole breakfast is breathtaking. (Rachel"
5,20,94,RACHEL,Good morning.
5,20,94,ALL,"Hey, hey."
5,20,94,RACHEL,"Kramer, I just want to thank you again for last night, you really"
5,20,95,MICHAEL,What happened?
5,20,95,RACHEL,"Well, I almost tried the lobster, but Kramer stopped me."
5,20,95,KRAMER,You'd regret it for the rest of your life.
5,20,95,RACHEL,"You're right, I would have."
5,20,95,JERRY,"Hey, look at this guy."
5,20,95,GEORGE,A little breakfast.
5,20,95,JERRY,Yeah.
5,20,95,GEORGE,"And, uh, you eat eggs, right?"
5,20,95,RACHEL,"Yes, I do, thanks."
5,20,95,JERRY,"Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like"
5,20,96,RACHEL,Umm... This is so good.
5,20,96,GEORGE,"Ah, enjoying them?"
5,20,96,RACHEL,Mm-hmm.
5,20,96,GEORGE,"Uh, good. You know, you might wanna try eating it with one of"
5,20,97,RACHEL,There's lobster in these eggs?
5,20,97,GEORGE,"Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water."
5,20,98,JERRY,"Well, I guess I gotta go, too."
5,20,98,ELAINE,"Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. (Policeman"
5,20,99,MICHAEL,Excuse me?
5,20,99,POLICE,"I'm sorry to bother you, but we're trying to track down a lobster"
5,20,100,KRAMER,Wonder what's goin' on.
5,20,100,GEORGE,"Ah, I guess I should go up and apologize."
5,20,100,MICHAEL,"There he is, officer. (Michael points to Kramer, Kramer"
5,20,101,RACHEL,Ahh! Don't you ever knock?
5,20,101,GEORGE,I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael to town.
5,20,101,ELAINE,"Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back in the same"
5,20,102,JERRY,I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.
5,20,102,ELAINE,How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?
5,20,102,JERRY,They got some sort of program.
5,20,103,GEORGE,"Hey, there's a tomato stand, let's stop, I can get some more."
5,20,103,JERRY,"Hey, isn't that Michael's car?"
5,20,103,ELAINE,There's Rachel.
5,20,103,GEORGE,Where?
5,20,103,THE END,
