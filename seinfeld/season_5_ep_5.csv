5,5,0,THE LIP READER,Written by Carol Leifer
5,5,1,JERRY,"Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing. Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't see us watching them? Tennis is basically just ping-pong and the players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. ""That'll be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please, shh."""
5,5,3,JERRY,Are these seats unbelievable or what?
5,5,3,GEORGE,Where's the sunblock?
5,5,3,JERRY,Here.
5,5,3,GEORGE,25? You don't have anything higher?
5,5,3,JERRY,"What, are you on Mercury?"
5,5,3,GEORGE,"I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free."
5,5,3,JERRY,You got a problem with paba?
5,5,3,GEORGE,"Yes, I have a problem with paba."
5,5,3,JERRY,You don't even know what paba is.
5,5,3,GEORGE,I know enough to stay away from it.
5,5,3,GEORGE,So are you going to Todd's party this weekend?
5,5,3,JERRY,I'll go if someone else drives. You going?
5,5,3,GEORGE,Gwen really wants to go.
5,5,3,JERRY,You're bringing a date to a party?
5,5,3,GEORGE,No good?
5,5,3,JERRY,"A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate. Ho, ho, ho."
5,5,3,GEORGE,Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk to?
5,5,3,JERRY,"Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross dressing. Seems like an interesting guy."
5,5,3,GEORGE,"Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me. Todd introduced us, I'm obligated."
5,5,3,JERRY,That woman is absolutely stunning.
5,5,3,GEORGE,The Croat?
5,5,3,JERRY,"Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful lineswoman I've ever seen."
5,5,3,GEORGE,"Yeah, she's a B.L."
5,5,3,GEORGE,Beautiful lineswoman. I'm going to go to the concession stand and get some real sunblock. You want anyting? Jerry? Jerry?
5,5,4,COWORKER,"You know, I just heard the Lexington line is out."
5,5,4,ELAINE,You are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?
5,5,4,COWORKER,Take a car service. We have an account.
5,5,4,ELAINE,"Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, and the driver is way up there on the stage."
5,5,4,COWORKER,"Well you're not going to get a cab now. Four thirty in the afternoon? Read a magazine, keep your head down."
5,5,4,ELAINE,I guess that could work.
5,5,6,ANNOUNCER,"And that is it. The match to Ms. Natalia Valdoni. Comming up next, mens single, but for now let's stop a minute and take a look at our beautiful tennis center backdrop."
5,5,6,KRAMER,"Hey, hey, it's George."
5,5,7,ANNOUNCER,"Holy cow it's a scorcher. Boy I bet you that guy can cover a lot of court. Hey buddy, they got a new invention. It's called a napkin. We'll take a station break and continue with more..."
5,5,8,DRIVER,"Dag Gavershole Plaza huh? Pendant Publishing, that's books right? Miss?"
5,5,8,ELAINE,Pardon me?
5,5,8,DRIVER,"Books, that's what you do?"
5,5,8,ELAINE,Yeah.
5,5,8,DRIVER,"Yeah, I don't read much myself, well you know besides the paper. Yeah a lot of people read to relax, but not me. You know what I do?"
5,5,8,ELAINE,"You know I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back here. So..."
5,5,8,DRIVER,I said you know what I do when I want to relax? The Jumble. Hey do you make a book of Jumbles?
5,5,8,ELAINE,I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf.
5,5,8,DRIVER,Going deaf?
5,5,8,ELAINE,What?
5,5,8,DRIVER,Oh I'm sorry.
5,5,8,ELAINE,It can be very frustrating.
5,5,8,DRIVER,Hey what about a hearing aid?
5,5,8,ELAINE,"An I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know you gotta live your life."
5,5,8,DRIVER,"No, no I said. Ehhh, forget it."
5,5,9,JERRY,I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. That lineswoman is absolutely mesmerizing.
5,5,9,GEORGE,Boy you are really smitten.
5,5,9,JERRY,I gotta talk to her. What do you think?
5,5,9,GEORGE,Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those guys.
5,5,9,JERRY,I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals.
5,5,9,GEORGE,They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the other side.
5,5,9,JERRY,I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.
5,5,9,GEORGE,"Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here. If you go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here on this side. Take me with you."
5,5,9,JERRY,I can't.
5,5,9,GEORGE,What are you going to say?
5,5,9,JERRY,"I don't know, ""Hi""."
5,5,9,GEORGE,"You think you're going to the other side with ""Hi""? You're not going to make it."
5,5,10,RADIO,Base to 92 come in
5,5,10,DRIVER,Yes this is 92
5,5,10,RADIO,After this go back to city for a 6:00 pickup
5,5,10,DRIVER,Righteo
5,5,10,RADIO,794 Bleeker the party's Hanks. Tom Hanks.
5,5,10,ELAINE,Tom Hanks? After me you're picking up Tom Hanks? I love him.
5,5,10,DRIVER,So I guess your hearing goes in and out huh?
5,5,10,ELAINE,Yeah. Yes it does...
5,5,10,DRIVER,Yeah. You know what I think? I think you made that whole thing up.
5,5,10,ELAINE,"No no, no no."
5,5,10,DRIVER,"Yeah yeah, I know your type. You're too good to make conversation with someone like me. Oh god forbid you could discuss the Jumbles. But to go so far as to pretend you're almost deaf, I mean that is truly disgusting. And Mr. Tom Hanks, may I say he too would be disgusted by your behavior."
5,5,11,JERRY,"Excuse me. Excuse me? Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. Nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too good for everyone, but it's women like you oh well, what are you deaf?"
5,5,11,LAURA,Bingo.
5,5,12,KRAMER,And you're saying she's deaf.
5,5,12,JERRY,"I'm not *saying* she's deaf, she's deaf."
5,5,12,KRAMER,Can't hear a thing.
5,5,12,JERRY,Can't hear a thing.
5,5,12,KRAMER,And you're going to go out with her.
5,5,12,JERRY,"Yeah, isn't that something?"
5,5,13,ELAINE,Hey.
5,5,13,JERRY AND KRAMER,Hey.
5,5,13,KRAMER,Hey I know how to sign.
5,5,13,JERRY,Really?
5,5,13,KRAMER,"Yeah when I was 8, I had a deaf cousin who lived with us for about a year. So I haven't been able to do it in a while."
5,5,13,ELAINE,What is this about?
5,5,13,JERRY,I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.
5,5,13,ELAINE,"You are kidding. That is amazing. I just took a car service from work and to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf."
5,5,13,JERRY,Wow good plan.
5,5,13,ELAINE,"Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. I know it's terrible, but I'm not a terrible person."
5,5,13,JERRY AND KRAMER,No.
5,5,13,ELAINE,"No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say ""get out of here"". I never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people."
5,5,13,JERRY,That's nice.
5,5,13,ELAINE,"Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, you know, because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable."
5,5,13,JERRY,That's nice for the freaks.
5,5,13,ELAINE,"Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do?"
5,5,13,JERRY,"Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about that friend of yours that works at the ticket area."
5,5,13,KRAMER,"Yeah yeah Pete, he can get you great tickets to something. Like a rock concert. Whatever you like."
5,5,13,ELAINE,"Oh, thanks Kramer."
5,5,13,KRAMER,"You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. I would love to be able to do that."
5,5,13,JERRY,"Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There are no ball men."
5,5,13,ELAINE,Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.
5,5,13,KRAMER,Well there ought to be ball men.
5,5,13,JERRY,"All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man go ahead, break the ball barrier."
5,5,13,ELAINE,Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw George at the tennis match on TV yesterday.
5,5,13,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real nice and tight. And he's..."
5,5,14,GWEN,I'm sorry George.
5,5,14,GEORGE,I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? Something must have happened.
5,5,14,GWEN,"It's not you, it's me."
5,5,14,GEORGE,"You're giving me the ""it's not you, it's me"" routine? I invented ""it's not you, it's me"". Nobody tells me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me."
5,5,14,GWEN,"All right, George, it's you."
5,5,14,GEORGE,You're *damn* right it's me.
5,5,14,GWEN,I was just trying to...
5,5,14,GEORGE,I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better than me.
5,5,14,GWEN,I'm sure you do it very well.
5,5,14,GEORGE,Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find out.
5,5,16,JERRY,But I thought things were going great.
5,5,16,GEORGE,Yeah so did I.
5,5,16,JERRY,Did she say why?
5,5,16,GEORGE,"No. She tried to give me the ""it's not you, it's me"" routine."
5,5,16,JERRY,But that's your routine.
5,5,16,GEORGE,Yeah. Well aparently word's out.
5,5,17,KRAMER,"Hey, George, I saw you on TV yesterday."
5,5,17,GEORGE,Really? At the tennis match?
5,5,17,KRAMER,Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae.
5,5,17,GEORGE,Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there.
5,5,17,KRAMER,"Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they made a couple of cracks about you."
5,5,17,GEORGE,Cracks? What were they saying?
5,5,17,KRAMER,That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking about how funny you looked.
5,5,17,GEORGE,Maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it.
5,5,17,KRAMER,Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight.
5,5,17,GEORGE,She must have seen me eating it on TV.
5,5,17,JERRY,So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends it? You really think she would be that superficial?
5,5,17,GEORGE,Why not. I would be.
5,5,18,JERRY,"Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye."
5,5,18,GEORGE,You're parents saw me on TV?
5,5,18,JERRY,Yeah.
5,5,18,GEORGE,This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on?
5,5,18,KRAMER,It felt like 8 seconds.
5,5,18,GEORGE,"One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand."
5,5,19,ELAINE,I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape it?
5,5,19,GEORGE,Can we move on?
5,5,19,JERRY,He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating the ice cream on
5,5,19,ELAINE,Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.
5,5,19,GEORGE,Yes I do.
5,5,19,ELAINE,So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.
5,5,19,GEORGE,"Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there."
5,5,19,KRAMER,Well she should be the one that shouldn't go.
5,5,19,JERRY,"Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place, who withdraws? What's the ettiquite?"
5,5,19,KRAMER,Excellent question.
5,5,19,JERRY,"I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the breakee. He needs to get on with his life."
5,5,19,ELAINE,I beg to differ.
5,5,19,JERRY,Really.
5,5,19,ELAINE,He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong the spoils.
5,5,19,JERRY,"Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic on Friday night."
5,5,19,ELAINE,Well we can take the car service from my office.
5,5,19,JERRY,Really?
5,5,19,ELAINE,"Yeah, they don't know."
5,5,19,KRAMER,"All right, I'll see you later."
5,5,19,JERRY,Okay.
5,5,19,GEORGE,"""To the victor goes the spoils."" What are you going to do tonight?"
5,5,19,JERRY,Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.
5,5,19,GEORGE,Oh.
5,5,19,JERRY,Why? Well what are you doing?
5,5,19,GEORGE,Well I was just going to wander the streets. Wouldn't want to tag along with you or anything.
5,5,19,JERRY,"Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?"
5,5,19,GEORGE,"Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh, where would we be going?"
5,5,20,GEORGE,"So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship."
5,5,20,LAURA,They never have napkins there.
5,5,20,JERRY,"Let's get the check. Is this considered signing? Do you do this when you want the check? Really. I know a sign, that's my first sign."
5,5,20,LAURA,"Uh, oh. That couple is breaking up."
5,5,20,GEORGE,They're breaking up? How do you know?
5,5,20,JERRY,She reads lips.
5,5,20,GEORGE,What are they saying now?
5,5,20,LAURA,"""It's not you, it's me."""
5,5,20,GEORGE,"Oh my gosh, I just had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read Gwen's lips for me."
5,5,20,JERRY,What?
5,5,20,GEORGE,"We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen is saying about me."
5,5,20,JERRY,"She's not a novelty act, George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas."
5,5,20,GEORGE,"Look. It's a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off."
5,5,20,JERRY,I don't know George. I'm not sure about this.
5,5,20,GEORGE,"Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case closed."
5,5,20,JERRY,All right.
5,5,20,JERRY,"Uh Laura, George was wondering if..."
5,5,20,LAURA,Sure. I'll do it.
5,5,21,JERRY,So I really had a good time.
5,5,21,LAURA,"Yeah, me too."
5,5,21,JERRY,So you want to go to the party on Friday night?
5,5,21,LAURA,Yeah.
5,5,21,JERRY,"All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by and pick you up. How about six? . Six is good. . You got a problem with six? . What? What?"
5,5,23,MAN,"Okay listen up people. There are plenty of you here, but we've only got two spots to fill. Good luck."
5,5,23,BOY,"Hey pops, isn't there a better way to spend your twilight years?"
5,5,23,KRAMER,"I may be old, but I'm spry."
5,5,23,BOY,The tryout lasts three and a half to four hours. Are you up for it?
5,5,23,KRAMER,Oh I'll be up for it punk.
5,5,25,JERRY,"See I was saying ""six"" but she thought I was saying ""sex"". We straightened the whole thing out though."
5,5,25,GEORGE,"She confused ""six"" with ""sex""?"
5,5,25,JERRY,Yeah.
5,5,25,GEORGE,"Well if she can't tell ""six"" from ""sex"" then how is she going to lip read from across the room?"
5,5,25,JERRY,"Well ""six"" and ""sex"" are close."
5,5,25,GEORGE,"It's two completely different sounds. ""ih"" and ""eh""."
5,5,25,JERRY,Eh.
5,5,25,GEORGE,It seems like a problem.
5,5,25,JERRY,Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.
5,5,26,KRAMER,Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals.
5,5,26,JERRY,You're kidding.
5,5,26,KRAMER,Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls with such gusto.
5,5,26,GEORGE,When is that car service comming?
5,5,26,JERRY,"In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there."
5,5,26,GEORGE,If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your friend.
5,5,26,JERRY,I know. It's like X-ray vision.
5,5,26,GEORGE,"If we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us."
5,5,27,NEWMAN,I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day.
5,5,27,JERRY,Can't do it Newman.
5,5,27,NEWMAN,"But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me two hours."
5,5,27,JERRY,Not going to happen.
5,5,27,NEWMAN,"All right, all right. All right you go ahead. You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you control the mail, you control... information."
5,5,28,JERRY,Oh just pull over right there by the stop sign.
5,5,28,DRIVER,Pardon me sir?
5,5,28,JERRY,I said pull over by the stop sign.
5,5,28,DRIVER,"I'm so sorry, you'll have to forgive me. I can't hear a damn thing. I went to that rock concert last night at the garden. My seats were right up agains the speaker. It's a heavy metal group. Metalla-something."
5,5,28,KRAMER,-ca.
5,5,28,DRIVER,Huh?
5,5,28,GEORGE,What?
5,5,28,JERRY,ca.
5,5,28,GEORGE,ah.
5,5,28,DRIVER,My ears are still ringing. Some woman's idea of a joke.
5,5,30,DRIVER,Get out. Get out. Go on. Hey. Shut the door.
5,5,32,JERRY,You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night.
5,5,33,JERRY,"I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, check, and late. Hey this is the guy you helped become the first ball man."
5,5,34,KRAMER,She doesn't know what she's talking about.
5,5,34,TODD,Guys you made it.
5,5,34,GEORGE,Hey hey.
5,5,34,TODD,Sorry to hear about Gwen.
5,5,34,GEORGE,Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up with me?
5,5,34,TODD,"Oh no. Tonight will be the first chance I've had to talk to her. Look George, I'm friends with both of you. I can't betray her confidence by telling you anything."
5,5,34,GEORGE,"I wouldn't hear of it, huh. It's none of my business. You should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll even stay all the way on the other side of the room so there's no chance of me overhearing anything."
5,5,34,TODD,You are so centered.
5,5,34,GEORGE,"Let's go, let's go. All right what are they saying?"
5,5,35,KRAMER,"""Hi Gwen, hi tide."""
5,5,35,JERRY,Hi tide?
5,5,35,KRAMER,Hi Todd.
5,5,35,KRAMER,"""You've got something between your teeth"""
5,5,35,GEORGE,What?
5,5,35,KRAMER,"No that's what he said. ""That's interesting. I love carrots, but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas, but I love pea soup."" So do I."
5,5,35,ELAINE,She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow afternoon?
5,5,35,JERRY,No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody.
5,5,35,GWEN,I don't envy you Todd. The place is going to be a mess.
5,5,35,TODD,Maybe you can stick around after everybody leaves and we can sweep together.
5,5,35,KRAMER,"""Why don't you stick around and we can sleep together."""
5,5,35,GEORGE,What?
5,5,35,KRAMER,"""You want me to sleep with you?"""
5,5,35,TODD,I don't want to sweep alone.
5,5,35,KRAMER,"He says ""I don't want to sleep alone."" She says, oh boy, ""love to."""
5,5,36,GEORGE,So you're getting rid of me and now the two of you are going to sleep together?
5,5,36,GWEN,What? You're crazy.
5,5,36,KRAMER,"""What? You're crazy."""
5,5,36,GEORGE,I heard your whole conversation.
5,5,36,GWEN,How?
5,5,36,KRAMER,"""How?"""
5,5,36,GEORGE,I can read lips. You said let's sleep together.
5,5,36,GWEN,"No I didn't. I said ""sweep"". Let's sweep together, you know with a broom. Cleaning up."
5,5,36,KRAMER,"""... with a broom, cleaning up."""
5,5,36,GEORGE,Sweep?
5,5,36,GWEN,Yes sweep.
5,5,36,KRAMER,"""Yes sweep."""
5,5,36,GEORGE,Cut it.
5,5,36,KRAMER,"George says ""Cut it."""
5,5,36,GEORGE,Cut it.
5,5,36,KRAMER,"George is saying ""Cut it."""
5,5,36,GEORGE,"Cut it. Would you stop signing? She said ""sweep together"" you idiots, not ""sleep together."""
5,5,37,KRAMER,I know how to sign.
5,5,38,GEORGE,"Ow. My eye, my eye."
5,5,39,ELAINE,It's so amazing getting to see Monica Sellas playing in the finals.
5,5,39,JERRY,I know and on the first tournament of her comeback.
5,5,40,JERRY,Thus ends the great ball man experiment.
5,5,41,DRIVER,You with the tennis center?
5,5,41,LAURA,Yep.
5,5,41,DRIVER,Hey how about that ball man injuring Monica Sellas. Wasn't that something.
5,5,42,DRIVER,Oh.
5,5,42,THE END,
