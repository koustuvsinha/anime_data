5,6,0,THE NON-FAT YOGURT,Written by Larry David
5,6,0,JERRY,I've always been a big fan of the little check move. You
5,6,2,ELAINE,Hmm!
5,6,2,GEORGE,Fantastic!
5,6,2,JERRY,I told you. How good is this?
5,6,2,GEORGE,Good.
5,6,2,JERRY,How good?
5,6,2,GEORGE,Very good.
5,6,2,ELAINE,They got blue berries. And there's real blue berries. What
5,6,3,JERRY,"Coffee. And they grind up the coffee beans, and they put it"
5,6,4,ELAINE,Let me test-taste that.
5,6,4,JERRY,Huh? Huh?
5,6,4,ELAINE,Hmm! Rico!
5,6,4,JERRY,Suave! And it's non-fat!
5,6,4,GEORGE,"See, how could this not have any fat? It's too good."
5,6,4,ELAINE,You want to taste mine?
5,6,4,GEORGE,"Oh, you want to taste mine."
5,6,4,ELAINE,"No, I don't."
5,6,4,GEORGE,"Okay, if you want to taste mine, you don't have to offer me"
5,6,5,ELAINE,"All right, let's just forget it."
5,6,5,JERRY,"You know, Kramer's going to clean up on this place."
5,6,5,GEORGE,What do you mean?
5,6,5,JERRY,He invested in it.
5,6,5,GEORGE,No kidding?
5,6,5,JERRY,Yeah. We've been coming here everyday. This is so
5,6,6,LADY,Jerry!
5,6,6,JERRY,"Oh, I'm sorry."
5,6,6,ELAINE,"All right, we should get going. But, I'm going to get a little"
5,6,7,GEORGE,"Oh, god. Look who's here."
5,6,7,JERRY,Who is it?
5,6,7,GEORGE,This guy from my old neighborhood. Lloyd: Braun. He's a
5,6,8,JERRY,"Oh, really?"
5,6,8,LLOYD,"Hey, George!"
5,6,8,GEORGE,Hey! Lloyd! My friend Jerry.
5,6,8,LLOYD,"So, I hear you're living back home now?"
5,6,8,GEORGE,"Yeah, there was a fire in my apartment."
5,6,8,LLOYD,"Fire! Whoa! There's a lot of major chicks in this place,"
5,6,9,GEORGE,"Uh, uh, yeah. Actually, the, uh, I bumped my elbow on a"
5,6,10,LLOYD,"Wow, that's a bitch, huh?"
5,6,10,LLOYD,"So, how are your parents doing?"
5,6,10,GEORGE,"Oh, pretty good."
5,6,10,LLOYD,"This place does some business, huh?"
5,6,10,GEORGE,"Yeah, this is my first time here."
5,6,10,LLOYD,"Hey, she's a doll."
5,6,10,ELAINE,Hi!
5,6,10,GEORGE,"Uh, Elaine, this is, uh, Lloyd."
5,6,10,ELAINE,Hi!
5,6,10,LLOYD,"Oh, hi! Very nice to meet you."
5,6,10,ELAINE,"Nice to meet you, too!"
5,6,10,LLOYD,"Well, I'm really sorry I got to run now. Well, take it easy,"
5,6,11,GEORGE,Yeah! Yeah.
5,6,11,ELAINE,"Boy, he is really cute!"
5,6,11,GEORGE,He's a jerk.
5,6,11,JERRY,"He's gone, George."
5,6,11,GEORGE,All right. All right.
5,6,11,KRAMER,"So, there were a lot of people there, huh?"
5,6,11,JERRY,"Oh, man, that yogurt place - you're going to make a fortune."
5,6,11,KRAMER,Yeah.
5,6,11,JERRY,They're doing an incredible business.
5,6,11,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, I told you to go in on it."
5,6,11,JERRY,How did you know?
5,6,11,KRAMER,"Well, I tasted it at the one downtown. It's got a remarkable"
5,6,12,JERRY,Yeah?
5,6,12,ELAINE,Buzz me.
5,6,12,JERRY,"Oh. Hey, I had the show of my life last night. I ad-libbed"
5,6,13,KRAMER,"Yeah, but did you tape it?"
5,6,13,JERRY,Right there. I got it. I did this thing on the Ottoman Empire.
5,6,14,KRAMER,Yes!
5,6,14,JERRY,"I'm telling you, I got like a whole new Tonight Show here."
5,6,14,ELAINE,Hey!
5,6,14,KRAMER,Hey!
5,6,14,JERRY,What's the matter?
5,6,14,ELAINE,"Oh, I was having lunch, and I bit down on the fork."
5,6,14,JERRY,"Boy, it's hard to believe - with all that biting experience - a"
5,6,15,KRAMER,Yow!
5,6,15,ELAINE,What?
5,6,15,KRAMER,"Well, you're getting heavy. Yeah, you look like you put on"
5,6,16,JERRY,Kramer!
5,6,16,KRAMER,"I'll tell you something else, you're looking a little chunky"
5,6,17,JERRY,Me?
5,6,17,KRAMER,Yeah.
5,6,17,JERRY,No.
5,6,17,ELAINE,"Where's your bathroom scale? Oh my god, I've gained seven"
5,6,18,JERRY,I've gained eight.
5,6,18,KRAMER,I told you.
5,6,18,ELAINE,"Oh, my god! A couple, but 7 pounds. How did I gain 7"
5,6,19,JERRY,How did I gain eight?
5,6,19,ELAINE,"I don't get it. I, I've been doing the same exercises. I"
5,6,20,JERRY,"Me, either. Wait a second. Wait a second. Maybe it's that"
5,6,21,KRAMER,"No, no, no. That's hundred percent yogurt."
5,6,21,JERRY,"Well, how else could this have happened?"
5,6,21,KRAMER,"Well, maybe it's the Oreos."
5,6,21,ELAINE,I don't eat Oreos.
5,6,21,KRAMER,You don't eat Oreos? The way you break them open?
5,6,22,JERRY,What about me?
5,6,22,KRAMER,You? You're getting old.
5,6,22,JERRY,Maybe your yogurt isn't so non-fat.
5,6,22,KRAMER,"Oh, guess again, Tubby!"
5,6,22,ELAINE,"Jerry, there's got to be a way to find that out."
5,6,22,JERRY,There must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of
5,6,23,ELAINE,Gasp! I've got it.
5,6,23,KRAMER,What?
5,6,23,ELAINE,I'll call the Food and Drug Administration.
5,6,23,KRAMER,"Hey, I'll tell you what, Chubby, if that yogurt has fat in it, I"
5,6,24,JERRY,"Well, let's start the insanity."
5,6,24,KRAMER,Giddy-up!
5,6,25,GEORGE,No.
5,6,25,MOM,I like tap dancing.
5,6,26,MOM,"Are you kidding? They practice for years, those people."
5,6,26,GEORGE,What's for supper?
5,6,26,MOM,Somebody's at the door.
5,6,27,MOM,Lloyd?
5,6,27,LLOYD,"Hello, Mrs. Costanza."
5,6,27,MOM,"Georgie, Lloyd: Braun is here."
5,6,28,MOM,What are you doing here?
5,6,28,LLOYD,"Well, I was just in the neighborhood visiting my mother, and"
5,6,29,MOM,Georgie. Come here and say hello.
5,6,31,LLOYD,"That's right. Hey, George."
5,6,31,GEORGE,"Hey, Lloyd. How's it going?"
5,6,31,LLOYD,I ran into George: yesterday in the city.
5,6,31,MOM,Ow! What's the matter with you?
5,6,31,LLOYD,"So, uh, how's the arm, huh?"
5,6,31,GEORGE,"Oh, it's good. It's good."
5,6,31,MOM,What's the matter with your arm?
5,6,31,GEORGE,Nothing.
5,6,31,LLOYD,"Oh, his arm moves like this."
5,6,32,GEORGE,Yeah.
5,6,33,MOM,"Me, either."
5,6,33,GEORGE,"Well, it comes and goes."
5,6,34,LLOYD,"Ooh! I asked Mr. Dinkins if he knew any good orthopedists,"
5,6,35,MOM,Mayor Dinkins got an appointment for him?
5,6,36,DISCUSSED GEORGE,with the mayor of New York?
5,6,36,MOM,Dinkins was talking about you. He was discussing you.
5,6,36,GEORGE,"You know, Lloyd, I've been to the doctor - there's really"
5,6,38,GEORGE,All right. All right. I'll go.
5,6,38,LLOYD,"Well, that's great. And, uh, I'll be very interested to hear the"
5,6,39,ELAINE,"Uh-huh. Okay, well, we're coming down. All right. Okay."
5,6,41,JERRY,And they said they can do it?
5,6,41,ELAINE,"Yeah, it's forty-five bucks."
5,6,41,JERRY,"All right. Let's go down to the yogurt store, and we'll get a"
5,6,42,ELAINE,Hm-hmm.
5,6,43,JERRY,What?
5,6,45,JERRY,"Gee, I'm really sorry."
5,6,47,JERRY,I'd be happy to.
5,6,48,JERRY,"Ah, Mary, we've been eating a lot of your husband's yogurt"
5,6,50,LLOYD,"Well, it was very nice seeing you again."
5,6,50,MOM,"Oh, it was good seeing you."
5,6,50,LLOYD,"Oh, um, by the way, who was that gorgeous woman I saw"
5,6,51,GEORGE,"Oh, uh, just a friend of mine."
5,6,51,MOM,You must mean Elaine. Isn't she adorable?
5,6,51,LLOYD,She is. She is. How about giving me her number?
5,6,51,GEORGE,"Oh, you know, Lloyd, I really don't have it."
5,6,51,MOM,She works at Pendant Publishing. Elaine: Benice.
5,6,51,LLOYD,"Oh, great. Thanks a lot!"
5,6,51,GEORGE,Yeah!
5,6,51,LLOYD,So long.
5,6,51,MOM,"Bye! Oh, that Lloyd: Braun. He is something, isn't he?"
5,6,53,JERRY,"Hello, Newman."
5,6,57,JERRY,It was an accident. I'm going to talk to him.
5,6,57,ELAINE,"I want a small, plain vanilla in a cup to go. That's non-fat,"
5,6,59,ELAINE,"'Cause I'm on a special diet, and the doctor said I can't have"
5,6,62,ELAINE,"Hurry, Jerry! Hurry!"
5,6,62,JERRY,How's it doing?
5,6,62,ELAINE,Not too good.
5,6,62,KRAMER,"Well, you can't have this tested now. It's melting."
5,6,62,JERRY,So what.
5,6,62,KRAMER,It changes the molecules.
5,6,62,JERRY,"Oh, you don't know what you're talking about."
5,6,62,KRAMER,"Hey, fatso! I got a 90 in biology."
5,6,62,JERRY,You call me fatso one more time; you're going to be walking
5,6,63,ELAINE,"Um, hi! Hi. I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested."
5,6,64,ELAINE,"Yeah. Oh, does it matter if it's melted?"
5,6,65,ELAINE,That's okay.
5,6,65,KRAMER,"Hello, there."
5,6,65,LABBETTE,Hello!
5,6,65,KRAMER,Ooh! Test tubes. Cool!
5,6,65,JERRY,What do you got there?
5,6,67,JERRY,Oh.
5,6,67,ELAINE,"Okay, I'm done."
5,6,67,LABBETTE,It was really nice meeting you.
5,6,67,KRAMER,"Well, the pleasure's all mine."
5,6,67,JERRY,You can't take that chemist out.
5,6,67,KRAMER,Why not?
5,6,67,JERRY,Because she's like the jury. She's going to be sequestered.
5,6,67,KRAMER,I'm not taking her out just to influence the results.
5,6,67,JERRY,"Well, I think the whole thing stinks."
5,6,67,ELAINE,It smells. Smells bad. Smells really bad.
5,6,67,JERRY,That's enough.
5,6,67,ELAINE,What?
5,6,67,JERRY,"Well, with the smells."
5,6,67,GEORGE,"So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor."
5,6,68,JERRY,Uh-huh.
5,6,68,GEORGE,"And I have to go. If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying."
5,6,68,JERRY,"Well, so, what are you going to do? Sit in the doctor's office"
5,6,69,GEORGE,"I don't care. Look, Lloyd: doesn't know what he's up against."
5,6,70,ELAINE,Hey!
5,6,71,ELAINE,"So, guess who called me."
5,6,71,GEORGE,"Oh, don't tell me. Lloyd?"
5,6,71,ELAINE,We're going out tomorrow night.
5,6,71,GEORGE,"Oh, look, he's going to ask you about my arm. So, just tell"
5,6,72,ELAINE,I can't say that.
5,6,72,GEORGE,Why not?
5,6,72,ELAINE,What if I like him? I'm going to start out lying to this guy?
5,6,72,GEORGE,"So, you're taking his side?"
5,6,72,ELAINE,No. But what if we get married or something? We'll always
5,6,73,GEORGE,Already you're marrying this guy?
5,6,73,ELAINE,You never know.
5,6,73,GEORGE,"All right, believe me, you're not going to marry him."
5,6,73,ELAINE,"All right, well, then what if we become a couple, George?"
5,6,74,JERRY,"No, I believe he can."
5,6,75,JERRY,Hi!
5,6,78,JERRY,"Listen, Matthew, I want to explain something to you. Now,"
5,6,80,JERRY,That's true. But it was an accident. And I haven't done it
5,6,81,ELAINE,"You know, Lloyd: advises Dinkins on everything he does."
5,6,81,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. Big advisor."
5,6,81,ELAINE,He tells him which soap to use.
5,6,81,JERRY,What the *beep* are you doing? You little piece of *beep*.
5,6,81,LABBETTE,Shh! We don't want to disturb the security guard.
5,6,81,KRAMER,Where's the lights. Whoa!
5,6,81,LABBETTE,How about this?
5,6,81,KRAMER,Yeah! Bunsen burner. You want a taste? It's Cappuccino.
5,6,81,LABBETTE,It's delicious.
5,6,81,KRAMER,I hear you.
5,6,81,LABBETTE,Non-fat?
5,6,81,KRAMER,"Well, you tell me. Is the verdict in yet?"
5,6,81,LABBETTE,No.
5,6,81,KRAMER,"Well, this is in case there's a tie!"
5,6,81,ELAINE,"Well, as far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and"
5,6,83,LLOYD,"Yeah, yeah. It's coming right down to the wire."
5,6,83,ELAINE,Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for
5,6,84,LLOYD,"Name tags, hmm?"
5,6,84,ELAINE,"Well, everybody would know everybody. It would be like a"
5,6,85,LLOYD,Maybe I'll mention that to him.
5,6,85,ELAINE,Really? Wow!
5,6,85,LLOYD,You sure you don't want any yogurt?
5,6,85,ELAINE,"No, I'm watching my weight."
5,6,85,LLOYD,"Well, it's nonfat."
5,6,85,ELAINE,"Yeah, so they say."
5,6,85,LLOYD,"Well, should we go?"
5,6,85,ELAINE,Yeah. Okay.
5,6,85,ELAINE,"Three days and he hasn't called me, and you know why?"
5,6,86,JERRY,He said that?
5,6,86,ELAINE,"No, but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm"
5,6,88,KRAMER,"Hey! So, hear anything on the yogurt?"
5,6,88,JERRY,"No, but I expect to hear anytime."
5,6,88,KRAMER,"Well, I wouldn't get your hopes up."
5,6,88,JERRY,Why do you say that?
5,6,88,KRAMER,"No reason. Oh, did you hear about that Dinkins?"
5,6,88,ELAINE,No. What about him?
5,6,88,KRAMER,You didn't hear?
5,6,88,ELAINE,Un-huh.
5,6,88,KRAMER,He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear
5,6,89,JERRY,Name tags?
5,6,89,KRAMER,"Yeah! So people can go around saying ""hello"" to one another."
5,6,89,JERRY,"Oh, I see. So you can go, ""Hey, you know who I saw"
5,6,90,KRAMER,He's become the laughing stock! You know The Times has
5,6,91,JERRY,"Hello? Yes. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh, really? Okay, thank you"
5,6,92,KRAMER,Yeow!
5,6,92,GEORGE,"The next morning, I woke up, and it was going like this. I"
5,6,93,DOCTOR,"Yes, well, I'm going to have to be perfectly honest with you."
5,6,93,GEORGE,"Please, doctor."
5,6,93,DOCTOR,I've examined you.
5,6,93,GEORGE,Yes.
5,6,93,DOCTOR,I've looked at your X-rays.
5,6,93,GEORGE,Uh-huh.
5,6,93,DOCTOR,And I find that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you.
5,6,93,GEORGE,Hmm. Really? Nothing?
5,6,93,DOCTOR,Nothing that would indicate involuntary spasms.
5,6,93,GEORGE,"Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?"
5,6,93,DOCTOR,"No, not really."
5,6,93,GEORGE,How so?
5,6,93,DOCTOR,May I suggest the possibility that you're faking?
5,6,93,GEORGE,Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see
5,6,94,DOCTOR,I don't know what kind of a person would do something like
5,6,96,GEORGE,"Now, see here, doctor."
5,6,96,DOCTOR,"I said, good-bye."
5,6,96,GEORGE,Fine. Ow!
5,6,96,ELAINE,"Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store."
5,6,96,JERRY,"Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to"
5,6,97,KRAMER,Okay.
5,6,97,NEWS,"Rudy Giuliani, who underwent a physical last week, received"
5,6,102,GIULIANI,It's hard to understand. Because I've been doing everything I
5,6,104,JERRY,"Yogurt? Oh, my god. They got Giuliani and he doesn't even"
5,6,105,ELAINE,Now look what you've done.
5,6,105,JERRY,"Well, we've got to do something. I'm calling Giuliani's"
5,6,106,GEORGE,Name tags! Name tags! What kind of an idiot thinks
5,6,109,GEORGE,I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office. And . . .
5,6,109,MOM,Be quiet. They're starting the press conference.
5,6,115,JERRY,"The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible."
5,6,115,GEORGE,Phew!
5,6,115,ELAINE,"Oh, it stinks."
5,6,115,KRAMER,"Mine, too. I got one more day."
5,6,115,JERRY,I can't eat this.
5,6,116,JERRY,"It had fat in it, it's not good for you."
5,6,119,ELAINE,"Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this. Apparently"
5,6,124,JERRY,"So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election."
5,6,124,ELAINE,I wonder what actually happened in that lab.
5,6,124,KRAMER,"Yeah, me, too."
5,6,125,BOY,"Thanks for ruining my daddy's business, you fat *beep*!"
5,6,125,THE END,
