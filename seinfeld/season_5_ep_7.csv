5,7,0,THE BARBER,Written by Andy Robin
5,7,0,MR. TUTTLE,Well George we here at Sanalac like to think of ourselves as a fairly progressive company. We
5,7,1,GEORGE,Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious.
5,7,1,MR. TUTTLE,"That's funny George. You're very quick. I feel like I, like I don't have to explain every little"
5,7,2,GEORGE,I enjoy understanding.
5,7,2,MR. TUTTLE,I want you to have this job. Of course...
5,7,2,SECRETARY,Mr. Zimmer is on line 2.
5,7,2,MR. TUTTLE,"Thanks. I've got to take this call. Listen, I'm really glad that you came in."
5,7,4,GEORGE,I want you to have this job. Of course...
5,7,4,JERRY,Yeah?
5,7,4,GEORGE,That's it.
5,7,4,JERRY,What do you mean that's it?
5,7,4,GEORGE,"He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview."
5,7,4,JERRY,"""Of course"" was the last thing he said?"
5,7,4,GEORGE,"Maybe he was going to say ""Of course I have to check with my associates."""
5,7,4,ELAINE,
5,7,5,JERRY,
5,7,5,GEORGE,All right.
5,7,5,ELAINE,Why don't you go ahead and call him?
5,7,5,GEORGE,Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That's what
5,7,6,JERRY,"So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job."
5,7,6,GEORGE,And if I don't call...
5,7,6,JERRY,"You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind of company is it?"
5,7,6,GEORGE,Rest stop supply.
5,7,7,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey."
5,7,7,JERRY,Shower?
5,7,7,KRAMER,Haircut.
5,7,7,JERRY,Who'd you use? Gino?
5,7,7,KRAMER,Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair.
5,7,7,ELAINE,What butcher?
5,7,7,KRAMER,The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses.
5,7,7,JERRY,Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings.
5,7,7,ELAINE,You never get good haircuts.
5,7,7,KRAMER,You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's there all by himself.
5,7,7,JERRY,Really?
5,7,7,ELAINE,"Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor"
5,7,8,KRAMER,What bachelor auction?
5,7,8,ELAINE,Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity.
5,7,8,KRAMER,And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money to cure polio.
5,7,8,JERRY,I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time.
5,7,8,KRAMER,Polio?
5,7,8,ELAINE,Will you go ahead? You need a haircut.
5,7,8,JERRY,Okay.
5,7,8,KRAMER,What are you all dressed up for?
5,7,8,GEORGE,I had a job interview.
5,7,8,KRAMER,Yeah. How'd it go?
5,7,8,GEORGE,Good. Of course...
5,7,9,ENZO,Oh Jerry.
5,7,9,JERRY,Oh hi Enzo.
5,7,9,ENZO,"Oh, you've come for the haircut."
5,7,9,JERRY,"No, actually I was just..."
5,7,9,ENZO,"It's my day off, but I take care of you anyway because you're my favorite customer. You've been"
5,7,10,JERRY,"Well I, if it's your day off I really..."
5,7,10,ENZO,"Eh, what's the difference."
5,7,11,JERRY,Well I don't want to take too much off.
5,7,11,ENZO,"Hey who's your barber, eh? You tell the joke, I cut the hair."
5,7,11,MAN,"Gino, you've outdone yourself this time. This is the best haircut I've ever had."
5,7,14,GEORGE,He massacred you. You look like you're five years old.
5,7,14,JERRY,What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps.
5,7,14,GEORGE,You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this relationship.
5,7,14,JERRY,I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd
5,7,15,GEORGE,You gotta do it.
5,7,15,JERRY,"I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart."
5,7,16,KRAMER,No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo.
5,7,16,JERRY,He did the job. You told me he wasn't going to be there.
5,7,16,KRAMER,So what?
5,7,16,JERRY,I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
5,7,16,KRAMER,His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying yourself. I'm not going to let
5,7,17,JERRY,No Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that.
5,7,17,KRAMER,"I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're going to get that haircut fixed up."
5,7,17,JERRY,I don't want you to call him.
5,7,17,KRAMER,"All right, geez. You're crazy."
5,7,18,GEORGE,So I still haven't heard about that job.
5,7,18,JERRY,Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about that?
5,7,18,GEORGE,I have an idea.
5,7,18,JERRY,Yeah?
5,7,18,GEORGE,I show up.
5,7,18,JERRY,What do you mean you show up?
5,7,18,GEORGE,"I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't"
5,7,19,JERRY,Hmm. Not bad.
5,7,19,GEORGE,What's the worst thing that could happen?
5,7,19,JERRY,"Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out"
5,7,20,GEORGE,"Yeah, so?"
5,7,21,GEORGE,Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hi nice to see
5,7,22,SECRETARY,How can I help you?
5,7,22,GEORGE,The name's George Constanza. I'm starting work here today. I was wondering if you could tell
5,7,23,SECRETARY,"I wasn't aware that, uh, Mike, this is George Constanza. He's starting here today."
5,7,23,MIKE,Welcome aboard.
5,7,23,GEORGE,Thanks Mike. Nice to be aboard.
5,7,23,MIKE,I wasn't aware that Mr. Tuttle was finished interviewing.
5,7,23,GEORGE,"Oh, well, he was probably just getting anxious to start his vacation."
5,7,23,SECRETARY,He wants to know where his office is.
5,7,23,MIKE,"Oh, ah, let's see, we've got two. There's a big one down the hall there and a small one over here."
5,7,24,GEORGE,Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just take the small office.
5,7,24,MIKE,Really?
5,7,24,GEORGE,"Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment. I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love"
5,7,25,MIKE,"All right, it's 808 right down there. Meanwhile, I'll get you the Pensky file, you can start working on that."
5,7,25,GEORGE,"Yes, yes of course. The Pensky file. Ho ho, can't wait to sink my teeth into that. Wow that"
5,7,30,JERRY,So what did you do there all day?
5,7,30,GEORGE,They gave me the Pensky file.
5,7,30,JERRY,So it's a nice place to work?
5,7,30,GEORGE,You know I'm enjoying it very much. I think my coworkers are really taking to me.
5,7,31,GEORGE,"I feel like a family. In fact, yesterday was Grace's birthday. She's such a sweet"
5,7,33,JERRY,What about your boss? The guys you interviewed you?
5,7,33,GEORGE,He'll be back on Monday.
5,7,34,JERRY,Hi.
5,7,34,ELAINE,Hi. How come you're wearing a hat?
5,7,34,JERRY,I got a haircut.
5,7,34,ELAINE,Oh yeah? Can I see it?
5,7,34,JERRY,Oh there's nothing to see.
5,7,34,ELAINE,Come on. Let me see it.
5,7,34,JERRY,Forget it.
5,7,34,ELAINE,Come on.
5,7,34,JERRY,All right.
5,7,36,ELAINE,I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
5,7,36,JERRY,"Well I'll tell you this, you can forget about me going to that bachelor auction."
5,7,36,ELAINE,"What? No Jerry, you have to go."
5,7,36,GEORGE,"You know Elaine, I'd do it but I'm working that day."
5,7,36,ELAINE,"Yeah, too bad."
5,7,37,KRAMER,It the worst haircut Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it.
5,7,37,GINO,"Sure, I fix it. But you gotta make sure you no tell anybody. He's a little crazy. I don't know what"
5,7,39,ENZO,"Oh ah, again with the Edward Scissorhands. How can you have hand like scissors, huh? Show me"
5,7,40,GINO,"Hey, it's a beautiful dream. I'd love to be this man."
5,7,40,ENZO,Did you ever think about what you're going to do on the toilet? What are you going to do
5,7,41,KRAMER,I'd like to have shoehorn hands.
5,7,42,KRAMER,"Okay listen to me. I talked to Gino, he's going to fix the haircut."
5,7,42,ELAINE,"Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction."
5,7,42,JERRY,"Yeah, but how am I..."
5,7,42,KRAMER,"No buts. His apartment tonight, Eight o'clock."
5,7,42,ELAINE,Can he fix it?
5,7,42,KRAMER,I don't know.
5,7,43,GINO,"Boy, you've got a beautiful head of hair."
5,7,43,JERRY,Thank you.
5,7,43,GINO,"I bet uncle Enzo, he tell you that all the time."
5,7,43,JERRY,Well actually Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while.
5,7,43,GINO,I don't think uncle Enzo realize what a lucky barber he is.
5,7,43,JERRY,That's nice of you to say.
5,7,44,GINO,Just a second. Yes.
5,7,44,ENZO,It's your uncle Enzo.
5,7,44,GINO,It's Uncle Enzo. Go in there. I'll clean up.
5,7,49,GINO,"Uncle Enzo, what are you doing here?"
5,7,49,ENZO,I've come to apologize.
5,7,49,GINO,Apologize?
5,7,49,ENZO,"Yes. I rented the move Edward Scissorhands. That Johnny Depp, he make me cry."
5,7,49,GINO,He make me cry too. You want something to drink?
5,7,49,ENZO,"Hey, what's all of this?"
5,7,49,GINO,Nothing. It's just hair.
5,7,49,ENZO,You do haircut in the apartment?
5,7,49,GINO,No. Pizza man was here. Maybe some fall off. He's going bald.
5,7,49,ENZO,It looks very familiar.
5,7,51,JERRY,In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really good.
5,7,51,KRAMER,"Yeah. Slow, gentle, attentive. I told you he could do it."
5,7,51,JERRY,Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor.
5,7,51,KRAMER,"Yeah, so?"
5,7,51,JERRY,I think he knew.
5,7,51,KRAMER,No. He doesn't know.
5,7,51,JERRY,Who do you know? He knows my hair.
5,7,51,KRAMER,Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a thing. Now come on. Pull yourself
5,7,52,JERRY,"Okay, okay."
5,7,53,ELAINE,What happened? It looks the same.
5,7,53,JERRY,He didn't get to finish it. His uncle came in. We almost got caught.
5,7,53,ELAINE,"Jerry, the auction is in a few hours."
5,7,53,JERRY,Take the K-man.
5,7,53,ELAINE,You can still go.
5,7,53,KRAMER,What are you kidding? Look at him. He's grotesque.
5,7,53,ELAINE,You think?
5,7,53,KRAMER,Do I think? He's repugnant.
5,7,54,ELAINE,What would you wear?
5,7,54,KRAMER,Whatever it takes.
5,7,55,ENZO,"See, now Newman is a good customer."
5,7,55,NEWMAN,Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to barber school. I always felt I had a talent
5,7,56,ENZO,"Oh, not everyone like Newman, so loyal."
5,7,56,NEWMAN,"Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I'm special."
5,7,56,ENZO,"You know I don't mind if somebody's funny, but I no like the funny business."
5,7,56,GINO,I'm going to go out for a little bit. I'll be right back.
5,7,56,ENZO,Take your time. You happy with the haircut?
5,7,56,NEWMAN,It's okay. A little crooked.
5,7,56,ENZO,How'd you like to have free haircut for six months.
5,7,56,NEWMAN,What's the catch?
5,7,56,ENZO,You're going to get me a sample of Jerry's hair.
5,7,56,NEWMAN,"Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a *year's* free haircuts. And a comb."
5,7,59,SECRETARY,"Mr. Costanza, Mr. Pensky is here to see you."
5,7,59,GEORGE,Mr. Pensky? Of the Pensky file?
5,7,60,PENSKY,Costanza? Arthur Pensky.
5,7,60,GEORGE,Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring the contents of the file into this
5,7,61,PENSKY,Where's Tuttle?
5,7,61,GEORGE,He's on vacation.
5,7,61,PENSKY,He was on vacation the last time I dropped by. Give me my file. Looks
5,7,62,GEORGE,Well you know in college they used to call me the little bulldog.
5,7,62,PENSKY,"Hey, you are Pensky material. Would you ever consider coming to work directly for me?"
5,7,62,GEORGE,Really?
5,7,62,PENSKY,You are aware...
5,7,63,SECRETARY,Mr. Castanza?
5,7,63,GEORGE,Not now Florice.
5,7,63,SECRETARY,I thought Mr. Pensky should know they're towing his car.
5,7,63,PENSKY,Damn this city.
5,7,64,GEORGE,I am aware. I am aware.
5,7,65,GINO,He knows. He knows about us.
5,7,65,JERRY,How do you know?
5,7,65,GINO,"Because I know. He's crazy. All morning, he looking at the hair. He *staring* at the hair."
5,7,66,JERRY,Who is it?
5,7,66,NEWMAN,It's Newman.
5,7,66,GINO,He was in the shop with Enzo. He can't see me here.
5,7,66,JERRY,"All right, go in the bedroom. Open the window. You can go out the fire escape."
5,7,67,JERRY,What do you want?
5,7,67,NEWMAN,Can I use your bathroom?
5,7,67,JERRY,What's wrong with yours?
5,7,67,NEWMAN,My toilet's clogged.
5,7,67,JERRY,You can't unclog it?
5,7,67,NEWMAN,No.
5,7,67,JERRY,Did you ask Kramer?
5,7,67,NEWMAN,He's out.
5,7,67,JERRY,Number one?
5,7,67,NEWMAN,"Yes, yes. Can I go? Cause I gotta go very badly."
5,7,67,JERRY,All right. Flush twice.
5,7,68,NEWMAN,No. Jackpot. I don't believe this.
5,7,70,JERRY,You all right?
5,7,70,NEWMAN,"Yeah, yeah."
5,7,70,JERRY,"All right, I'll see you later."
5,7,70,NEWMAN,What are you doing?
5,7,70,JERRY,I'm watching Edward Scissorhands.
5,7,70,NEWMAN,"Oh, can I watch a little? It's my favorite movie."
5,7,70,JERRY,Yeah all right.
5,7,72,JERRY,You want something to drink?
5,7,72,NEWMAN,No.
5,7,75,JERRY,"If you want to watch, sit down. You're making me nervous. I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of"
5,7,77,NEWMAN,"Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel"
5,7,79,ENZO,Did you get it? Oh you done good Newman.
5,7,79,NEWMAN,It was a cinch. Where are you going?
5,7,79,ENZO,Io volgio vandetta.
5,7,80,ELAINE,"Nine hundred. Do I hear a thousand? Ladies, he is a Harvard graduate."
5,7,80,WOMAN,A thousand.
5,7,80,ELAINE,"A thousand. Okay, a thousand once, a thousand twice, a thousand three times, sold to the lucky"
5,7,82,ELAINE,"Okay next bachelor is number, um 124 on your program. He's uh, he's a high school graduate."
5,7,82,KRAMER,Equivalent.
5,7,82,ELAINE,"Oh, uh equivalency. A high school equivalency program graduate. He's uh, self-employed. He's..."
5,7,84,ELAINE,"Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do I hear, uh, five bucks?"
5,7,85,JERRY,"I don't get this Scissorhands. What, is he supposed to be like a super hero, like Green Lantern or"
5,7,87,JERRY,Who is it?
5,7,87,ENZO,Enzo Manginero.
5,7,88,JERRY,"Oh my god, he knows. Go. One second."
5,7,88,ENZO,It was you that was in Gino's apartment the other night.
5,7,88,JERRY,No I wasn't there.
5,7,88,ENZO,Don't lie. I know it was you. I get a sample of your hair. I match them up.
5,7,88,JERRY,"Sample? Newman. Uh, I was there but I was just dropping off a book."
5,7,88,GINO,Don't Jerry.
5,7,88,ENZO,"So, it's true."
5,7,88,GINO,Yes it's true.
5,7,88,ENZO,I'm going to kill the both of you.
5,7,92,GEORGE,"Mr. Tuttle, you're back."
5,7,92,TUTTLE,"George, I'm surprised to see you here."
5,7,92,GEORGE,You are?
5,7,92,TUTTLE,I though you would have taken the large office.
5,7,92,GEORGE,Oh. Really.
5,7,92,TUTTLE,I guess I didn't make that clear when I hired you. So where's that Pensky file? Let's see what
5,7,93,GEORGE,Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace.
5,7,93,TUTTLE,You haven't done anything with this.
5,7,93,GEORGE,Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office.
5,7,93,TUTTLE,I'm beginning to wonder if you understand anything.
5,7,93,GEORGE,You are aware that Pensky is interested in me.
5,7,93,TUTTLE,You're not Pensky material.
5,7,93,GEORGE,"Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle."
5,7,100,PENSKY,"Gee George, I'm sorry I gave you the wrong impression. What is was going to say was, now you"
5,7,102,GEORGE,Obviously.
5,7,103,PENSKY,Yes.
5,7,103,SECRETARY,"Excuse me, but Mr. Costanza's car is being towed."
5,7,104,THE END,
