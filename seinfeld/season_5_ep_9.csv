5,9,75,ELAINE,Are you out of your mind?!
5,9,75,JERRY,"...ho-ah. It's, it's, it's kitschy."
5,9,75,ELAINE,Winona is a Native American.
5,9,75,JERRY,She is?
5,9,78,SYLVIA,You got very unusual taste.
5,9,78,GEORGE,I hope prune juice is alright. It's the only thing
5,9,79,SYLVIA,Fine.
5,9,79,GEORGE,I'm sorry about that lock on the liquor cabinet. The combination musta
5,9,80,SYLVIA,Ahh! Is this your son in the bubble bath?
5,9,80,GEORGE,"No, that's me."

5,9,86,ELAINE,It's right over there.
5,9,86,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah, thanks. Yeah, it's got the magic grip. How d'you"
5,9,88,ELAINE,You want it?
5,9,88,KRAMER,I can have this?!
5,9,88,ELAINE,"Yuh! You wanna lug it uptown, it's yours."
5,9,88,KRAMER,Oh. I'll lug.
5,9,89,WINONA,It's just that it's a very sensitive issue for me.
5,9,89,JERRY,"And well it should be. I think if you spent any time with me at all,"
5,9,91,WINONA,I guess I could go for a bite.
5,9,91,JERRY,"You like Chinese food, 'cos I once went to a great Szechwan restaurant in"
5,9,95,MAILMAN,Why must I know? Because I'm Chinese? You think I know where all the

5,9,99,KRAMER,Hey Jerry! Look what I got!
5,9,104,GEORGE,Looks pretty good.
5,9,104,JERRY,"Yeah, did a good job."
5,9,105,GEORGE,Yeah. I don't think they'll be able to tell.
5,9,105,JERRY,"You know, I don't get it. Not allowed to ask a Chinese person where the"
5,9,107,GEORGE,"So, anyway, what's uh, what's the status with, uh..."
5,9,107,JERRY,"Ah, she kinda calmed down. I talked to her today. In fact I'm gonna see"
5,9,108,GEORGE,"Oh, great."
5,9,108,JERRY,"Yeah, but I'm a little uncomfortable. I'm afraid of making another"

5,9,110,ESTELLE,Hello Jerry.
5,9,110,JERRY,Hello.
5,9,110,GEORGE,"So, how was the trip?"
5,9,110,ESTELLE,"Ah, your father..."
5,9,110,FRANK,Is there anything wrong with getting a receipt at a toll booth?
5,9,110,ESTELLE,I'm going upstairs.
5,9,110,FRANK,"This stack should be bigger, where's the TV Guide?"
5,9,110,GEORGE,What TV Guide?
5,9,110,FRANK,"I'm missing TV Guide volume forty-one, number thirty-one."
5,9,110,JERRY,"Uh, Elaine took it to read on the subway."
5,9,110,FRANK,Elaine took it?
5,9,110,GEORGE,I didn't know she took it!
5,9,110,JERRY,"Wa, it's two weeks old."
5,9,110,FRANK,How could you let her take the TV Guide?!
5,9,110,GEORGE,He collects them.
5,9,110,JERRY,You collect TV Guide?
5,9,110,FRANK,"The nerve of that woman. Walking into my house, stealing my collectible!"
5,9,110,ESTELLE,Oh my God! This was in
5,9,111,FRANK,What is this? A prophylactic
5,9,112,ESTELLE,What is this doing on my bed?!
5,9,112,GEORGE,"I don't know, uh..."
5,9,112,JERRY,I'll see you later.
5,9,112,FRANK,You were having sex on our bed?!
5,9,112,GEORGE,Yes!
5,9,112,ESTELLE,Who told you you could have sex in our bed?
5,9,112,GEORGE,"Well, my bed is too small."
5,9,112,FRANK,"Your bed is too small? I'm gone two weeks and you turn our house into,"
5,9,113,ESTELLE,Where am I going to sleep?
5,9,113,GEORGE,What're you talking about?
5,9,113,ESTELLE,I can't sleep in there!
5,9,113,GEORGE,Of course you can.
5,9,113,ESTELLE,I can't! I can't!
5,9,113,FRANK,That's it! You're grounded!
5,9,113,GEORGE,"You can't ground me, I'm a grown man."
5,9,113,FRANK,You wanna live here? You respect the rules of our house. You're
5,9,116,WINONA,"So, where are we gonna go eat?"
5,9,116,JERRY,I thought we'd eat at the Gentle Harvest.
5,9,116,WINONA,"Ooh, I love that place, but it's usually so crowded. Can we get a table?"
5,9,116,JERRY,"Ah, don't worry. I made reser..."
5,9,116,WINONA,You made what?
5,9,116,JERRY,"I uh, I uh, I arranged for the appropriate accommodation. And then, Knick"
5,9,117,WINONA,How did you get these?
5,9,117,JERRY,"Got 'em on the street, from a scal... A uh, one"
5,9,118,WINONA,What guys?
5,9,118,JERRY,"You know, the guys, that uh, they sell the tickets for the sold-out"

5,9,120,WINONA,"Sure, take it."
5,9,120,JERRY,Thanks.
5,9,122,JERRY,"So, Winona had the TV Guide. Told you I'd make it up to you."
5,9,122,ELAINE,"Aah, so Mr Costanza was pretty mad, huh?"
5,9,122,JERRY,Yeah. You almost ruined his life's work.
5,9,122,ELAINE,He collects these?
5,9,122,JERRY,Yeah.
5,9,122,ELAINE,"Wow! Alright, well I will personally go out to Queens and deliver his Al"

5,9,128,KRAMER,"Yeah uh, Elaine uh, what'd he say?"
5,9,128,ELAINE,What did who say?
5,9,128,KRAMER,Your boss. Didn't you tell him about the coffee table book?
5,9,128,ELAINE,Uhmm...
5,9,128,KRAMER,"Yeah, you didn't tell him didya?"
5,9,128,ELAINE,"Kramer, it is such a dumb idea. I would be (raising her voice as Kramer"
5,9,129,KRAMER,"Wait a minute, on the cover I'm..."
5,9,129,ELAINE,I would be embarrassed to bring it up.
5,9,129,JERRY,"I thought it was a pretty good idea. It's about coffee tables, it's on a"
5,9,130,KRAMER,"Yeah, right, right, and on the cover is a built-in coaster. (clicks"
5,9,131,JERRY,Where you going?
5,9,131,KRAMER,"Well, I'm gonna go to the cigar stores. I'm gonna see if I can sell that"
5,9,132,JERRY,My Indian?
5,9,132,KRAMER,"You know, I think it's worth something. It's kitschy."
5,9,136,FRANK,How do you just walk into a house and take a TV Guide? How does she
5,9,140,RICKY,Hello. Is Elaine home?
5,9,140,ESTELLE,"Elaine Benes? Oh, she's my son's friend."
5,9,140,FRANK,And she's not welcome in this house!
5,9,140,RICKY,"Oh, 'cos I made her this very special gift. 'Kay, it's a"
5,9,141,FRANK,That's my TV Guide! Ripped to shreds! She gave that to you?!
5,9,141,RICKY,"Hey, is that the Twilight Zone you're watching?"
5,9,141,GEORGE,Yeah.
5,9,141,RICKY,"Oh, this is a good one."
5,9,143,TANNOY,"Next stop, Queensboro Plaza."
5,9,144,ELAINE,"Mmm, gyro."
5,9,148,WINONA,I like your place. It's very unassuming.
5,9,148,JERRY,"Well, why would I assume. I never assume. Leads to assumptions."
5,9,148,WINONA,"Oh, by the way. That TV Guide I gave you, I need it back."
5,9,148,JERRY,Why?
5,9,148,WINONA,"Well, I'm doing a report on minorities in the media, and I wanted to use"
5,9,149,JERRY,"Well, it's too late. I gave it to Elaine, and she's already on her way to"
5,9,150,WINONA,"Jerry, I really need it back. It, it is mine."
5,9,150,JERRY,"You can't give something and then take it back. I mean, what are you..."
5,9,151,WINONA,What?
5,9,151,JERRY,"A uh, a person that uh..."
5,9,151,WINONA,A person that what?
5,9,151,JERRY,"Well, a person that gives something and then they're dissatisfied and"
5,9,152,WINONA,And?
5,9,152,JERRY,"...give, given it to the person that they originally gave it to."
5,9,152,WINONA,"You mean like, an Indian giver?!"
5,9,152,JERRY,"I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term."
5,9,158,RICKY,I like the special fall preview issues the best.
5,9,158,FRANK,Those. I've been saving those from the beginning.
5,9,159,RICKY,"These are worth like, a lot of money."
5,9,160,ESTELLE,"Oh, hello Elaine!"
5,9,160,ELAINE,Hello.
5,9,160,RICKY,Elaine! Hello! You look scrumptious.
5,9,161,FRANK,Why'd you take my TV Guide?
5,9,161,ELAINE,"I'm so sorry about that Mr Costanza, but look. Look, I"
5,9,162,RICKY,I made this for you.

5,9,162,FRANK,What is this? You got stains all over it! What the
5,9,163,RICKY,"Hey, you can't talk to her like that."
5,9,163,FRANK,I'll talk to her any way I want!
5,9,163,RICKY,"Come on Elaine, let's go."
5,9,165,ESTELLE,My coffee table!
5,9,169,KRAMER,"I don't understand. How can you have a cigar store, without an Indian?"
5,9,170,SPIKE,I'll give you a box of Coronas for it.
5,9,170,KRAMER,Forget it.
5,9,170,LIPPMAN,"Uh, excuse me. Are you uh, selling this Indian?"
5,9,170,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, yeah."
5,9,170,LIPPMAN,"Uh, I'm just uh, redecorating my office in a south-western motif and"
5,9,171,KRAMER,Giddyup.
5,9,171,LIPPMAN,"Yeah? Could you help me bring it up to my office, I'm right next door."
5,9,172,KRAMER,Pendant Publishing? Giddyup again.
5,9,174,ELAINE,"Mr Lippman. I'm sorry, I was in Queens uh... Kramer!"
5,9,174,KRAMER,"Yeah, hi Elaine."
5,9,174,ELAINE,What are you doing in here with that?
5,9,174,KRAMER,"Ah, well, it's a business transaction."
5,9,174,LIPPMAN,"Listen uh, petty"
5,9,175,KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm sure it's all here. You know I was"
5,9,176,LIPPMAN,"You like that, huh? I had that custom made for me in Santa Fe."
5,9,176,KRAMER,You mind if I use it in my book?
5,9,176,LIPPMAN,What book?
5,9,176,KRAMER,"Well, I'm doing a coffee table book on coffee tables."
5,9,176,LIPPMAN,About coffee tables?
5,9,177,KRAMER,Uh huh.
5,9,177,LIPPMAN,That's fantastic. Who's your publisher?
5,9,177,KRAMER,"Well, I'm still shopping it around."
5,9,177,LIPPMAN,"Yeah? You see, this is the kind of idea you should be"
5,9,178,ELAINE,Well I ...manuscript that
5,9,178,LIPPMAN,"God, that Indian really completes the room. Don't you"
5,9,182,SYLVIA,"I know this coffee table, it's George Costanza's."
5,9,182,ESTELLE,It's mine. I'm his mother.
5,9,182,SYLVIA,"Oh, I haven't seen George for a while. He must be working very hard."
5,9,182,ESTELLE,George doesn't work. He's a bum. That's why he lives at home with us.
5,9,182,SYLVIA,He does?
5,9,185,JERRY,I don't know why we didn't think of this before. We just could call TV
5,9,186,ELAINE,I dunno.
5,9,186,JERRY,"Well, it's gonna make Mr Costanza very happy. (he hands the magazine to"
5,9,187,ELAINE,I guess.
5,9,187,JERRY,What's the matter?
5,9,187,ELAINE,What d'you think is the matter? I've been assigned to work on Kramer's
5,9,188,JERRY,"It is a good idea, Elaine."
5,9,188,TANNOY,"Next stop, Queensboro Plaza."
5,9,188,JERRY,You want a gyro?
5,9,188,ELAINE,I don't think so.
5,9,192,JERRY,Elaine!
5,9,194,AL ROKER,Guess your boyfriend's gonna have to catch the next train.
