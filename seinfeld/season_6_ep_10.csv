6,10,9,JERRY,You sure you don't want the tickets?
6,10,9,GEORGE,No thanks.
6,10,9,JERRY,I can't believe I'm having trouble getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.
6,10,9,GEORGE,"I'm telling you, skip the Drake's wedding, go to the game."
6,10,9,JERRY,"I can't, the Drake put me in the wedding party."
6,10,9,GEORGE,Well who schedules his wedding on Super Bowl Sunday?
6,10,9,JERRY,Maybe he didn't know?
6,10,9,GEORGE,Lemme see. I can't believe you got these for free. (Looking at the
6,10,10,JERRY,"Row F, in front of the Gs, hobnobbing with the Ds and Es."
6,10,10,GEORGE,"Howbout Kramer or Elaine, they don't want them?"
6,10,10,JERRY,"I asked. Elaine laughed at me, Kramer's only interested in Canadian"
6,10,11,GEORGE,Wish I could help you.
6,10,11,JERRY,"Come on, take them. You could take Bonnie."
6,10,11,GEORGE,You paying my hotel and airfare to Miami?
6,10,11,JERRY,What do you think?
6,10,11,GEORGE,"So in order to use these, I gotta spend like fifteen-hundred bucks."
6,10,13,JERRY,"Yeah, sleeping arrangements. So, you haven't, uh..."
6,10,13,GEORGE,"Oh, no no no, I haven't even seen her apartment yet. Tomorrow night's"
6,10,14,JERRY,Aah.
6,10,14,GEORGE,"Hey, is that Tim Whatley?"
6,10,14,JERRY,The Dentist?
6,10,14,GEORGE,"Yeah, is he still mad at you for crashing his Thanksgiving party?"
6,10,14,JERRY,"Oh, no. I explained the whole thing to him, he was fine with it."
6,10,14,GEORGE,Oh good.
6,10,14,JERRY,"Yeah, I blamed it on you. Hi Tim."
6,10,14,TIM,Hey Jerry! George. What are you up to?
6,10,14,JERRY,"Ah, just a couple of gals out on the town, shopping and gabbing."
6,10,14,GEORGE,I'm getting a makeover.
6,10,14,JERRY,Hey. How would you like to go to the Super Bowl?
6,10,14,TIM,"What, are you kidding?"
6,10,14,JERRY,Here. Two tickets. Have a good time.
6,10,14,TIM,"How can I think you? I'll tell you what, I'll take you to dinner"
6,10,15,JERRY,No no no. No dinner.
6,10,16,JERRY,"Tim, you didn't have to get me a thank you gift. I know, it's a label"
6,10,19,JERRY,Come in.
6,10,20,KRAMER,Where can I put this?
6,10,20,JERRY,What is it?
6,10,20,KRAMER,"It's Risk, Jerry. The game of world conquest. (brushing newspapers off"
6,10,23,JERRY,"Kramer, why do you have to Hello, Newman."
6,10,23,NEWMAN,"Hello, Jerry. Will he take it? I gotta go to work."
6,10,23,JERRY,Take what?
6,10,23,KRAMER,"The board, Jerry. We've been playing at Newman's for six hours but"
6,10,24,JERRY,So why don't you leave it at Newman's?
6,10,24,NEWMAN,"I wanted to, he won't let me."
6,10,24,KRAMER,We have to put the board in a neutral place where no one will tamper
6,10,25,JERRY,So that's here?
6,10,25,KRAMER,"Yes, yes. You're like Switzerland."
6,10,25,JERRY,I don't wanna be Switzerland.
6,10,25,KRAMER,"Jerry, Newman and I are engaged in a epic struggle for world"
6,10,26,NEWMAN,Don't look at me.
6,10,26,KRAMER,"Oh, I'm looking right at you, big daddy."
6,10,26,JERRY,"Alright, soldier boys, let's fall out."
6,10,26,KRAMER,"Alright, so you're gonna look after it?"
6,10,26,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah."
6,10,26,KRAMER,Stay strong buddy.
6,10,26,JERRY,Yeah.
6,10,26,KRAMER,Watch it good.
6,10,26,JERRY,Ok.
6,10,27,ELAINE,Hey.
6,10,27,JERRY,Hey.
6,10,27,ELAINE,"Hey. Oh, is that a label maker?"
6,10,27,JERRY,"Yes it is. I got it as a gift, it's a Label Baby Junior."
6,10,27,ELAINE,"Love the Label Baby, baby. You know those things make great gifts, I"
6,10,28,JERRY,Tim Whatley?
6,10,28,ELAINE,Yeah. Who sent you that one?
6,10,28,JERRY,One Tim Whatley!
6,10,29,JERRY,"The same, he sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets."
6,10,29,ELAINE,I think this is the same one I gave him. He recycled this gift. He's
6,10,30,JERRY,"Or maybe he liked your gift so much, he decided to get me the same"
6,10,31,ELAINE,"Yeah, perhaps."
6,10,31,JERRY,Well how did he react when you gave it to him?
6,10,31,ELAINE,"Um, he said, ""Oh. A label maker. Howbout that?"""
6,10,31,JERRY,He repeated the name of the gift?
6,10,31,ELAINE,"Yeah, so?"
6,10,31,JERRY,"Oh, well, if you repeat the name of the gift, you can't possibly like"
6,10,32,ELAINE,What do you mean?
6,10,32,JERRY,"Oh, you know, like when someone opens something up and they go, ""Oh."
6,10,33,ELAINE,"I don't know, I guess I'll just get invited up to his apartment and see"
6,10,34,JERRY,Why'd you get him a gift anyway?
6,10,34,ELAINE,"Oh, he did some dental work for me and he didn't charge me so I thought"
6,10,35,JERRY,"Yeah, well, if you're getting him anything for his birthday, I'm a"
6,10,37,BONNIE,"Well, here we are. This is the place."
6,10,37,GEORGE,Wow.
6,10,37,BONNIE,Do you like it?
6,10,37,GEORGE,"I love it! This is fantastic! Look at this couch, is this velvet?!"
6,10,37,BONNIE,Are you a velvet fan?
6,10,37,GEORGE,A fan? I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable.
6,10,38,BONNIE,"Aren't they great? Oh, Scott, hi."
6,10,40,GEORGE,Heh heh.
6,10,40,BONNIE,"Here, check out this view. If you lean out this window, you can see"
6,10,42,GEORGE,"So Scott's your roommate, huh?"
6,10,42,BONNIE,"Yes. Oh, I'm sure I've mentioned him."
6,10,42,GEORGE,"No, you didn't mention it."
6,10,42,BONNIE,"He's a great guy, you'll really like him."
6,10,42,GEORGE,I'm sure I will.
6,10,43,JERRY,"Male roommate, huh?"
6,10,43,GEORGE,Yes. A male roommate.
6,10,43,JERRY,Is this a problem?
6,10,43,GEORGE,"It's a huge problem, Jerry. The hardest part about having sex with a"
6,10,44,JERRY,"Well, maybe he's --"
6,10,44,GEORGE,"No. Believe me, he's not."
6,10,44,JERRY,So he's an eligible receiver.
6,10,44,GEORGE,She's confiding in him about our dates. You always like the person you
6,10,46,JERRY,What's stopping them?
6,10,46,GEORGE,Exactly! You know how they get animals to reproduce in captivity?
6,10,47,JERRY,What does he look like?
6,10,47,GEORGE,"Oh, that's the worst part of it. He looks just like me."
6,10,47,JERRY,He looks like you and he's working from the inside?
6,10,47,GEORGE,I look like me and I'm working from the outside. Who do you think is
6,10,48,JERRY,Not you.
6,10,48,GEORGE,Ho ho. This bizarre ?harrod? experiment must end!
6,10,48,JERRY,We'll take a check please.
6,10,48,GEORGE,"I gotta find a way to work this out, I love that apartment. It's so"
6,10,49,JERRY,"I know, you would drape yourself in velvet."
6,10,49,GEORGE,I've said that before?
6,10,49,JERRY,"Many times. You love velvet, you want to live in velvet, everything"
6,10,50,KRAMER,Hey.
6,10,50,GEORGE,Hey.
6,10,50,JERRY,Hey.
6,10,50,KRAMER,Guess what? I saw Newman talking to the super.
6,10,50,JERRY,So what?
6,10,50,KRAMER,The super has keys to your apartment. Don't you see what's going on?
6,10,51,JERRY,"Oh, maybe he's got no hot water."
6,10,51,KRAMER,"Yeah, alright, fine. You sit there and you watch while Newman takes"
6,10,53,JERRY,Are you through?
6,10,53,KRAMER,"Oh. I talked to Arthur Jobanian. Yeah, the Drake's wedding? That's"
6,10,54,JERRY,The wedding is off? What happened?
6,10,54,KRAMER,"The Drake, he found out that the wedding is on the same day as the"
6,10,57,GEORGE,The wedding is off. Now you can go to the Super Bowl.
6,10,57,JERRY,I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back.
6,10,57,GEORGE,"You just gave them to him two days ago, he's gotta give you a grace"
6,10,58,JERRY,Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving? There's no
6,10,59,GEORGE,"Well, didn't he regift the label maker?"
6,10,59,JERRY,Possibly.
6,10,59,GEORGE,"Well, if he can regift, why can't you degift?"
6,10,59,JERRY,You may have a point.
6,10,59,GEORGE,"I have a point, I have a point."
6,10,59,JERRY,"Alright, I'll call him."
6,10,59,GEORGE,Yeah. What's that?
6,10,59,JERRY,"Oh, it's Risk, it's a game of world domination being played by two guys"
6,10,63,GEORGE,"Well they're his tickets, he can do what he wants"
6,10,64,JERRY,Thanks.
6,10,64,GEORGE,"Alright, I gotta go. I'm heading over to Bonnie's."
6,10,64,JERRY,What are you gonna do about the roommate?
6,10,64,GEORGE,I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him. It's like a
6,10,65,JERRY,"Well, the pickle breath is a good start."
6,10,67,NEWMAN,"Hello Jerry, may I come in?"
6,10,67,JERRY,What do you want?
6,10,67,NEWMAN,"Nothing, just being neighborly. Do you wanna hang out? Shoot the breeze?"
6,10,67,JERRY,"I'm not letting you cheat, Newman. You're not getting anywhere near"
6,10,68,NEWMAN,Jerry? I'm a little insulted.
6,10,68,JERRY,"You're not a little anything, Newman. So just pack it up and move it"
6,10,69,NEWMAN,"Oh, by the way, what are you doing for the Super Bowl?"
6,10,69,JERRY,"I dunno, watch it on TV I guess. Why?"
6,10,69,NEWMAN,"Well if you watch closely enough, you just might see me. I'll be the"
6,10,70,JERRY,You're going to the Super Bowl?
6,10,70,NEWMAN,"Yes I am, a guy on my mail route just got a couple of tickets and he"
6,10,71,JERRY,What's his name?
6,10,71,NEWMAN,Tim Whatley.
6,10,71,JERRY,That's my ticket!
6,10,71,NEWMAN,"Is it?! Ohhh, well if only you'd known, you could have saved some time"
6,10,72,JERRY,Newman!
6,10,73,GEORGE,What a movie. Good choice.
6,10,73,BONNIE,Thank Scott. He recommended it.
6,10,73,GEORGE,"Oh, Scott, Scott. He's really great, isn't he?"
6,10,73,BONNIE,Yes he is.
6,10,73,GEORGE,Yes he is. Let me ask you something. When you come out of the shower
6,10,75,BONNIE,George?
6,10,75,GEORGE,"Do you hold the neck together with one hand, or are you just letting it"
6,10,76,BONNIE,"George, you're being ridiculous."
6,10,76,GEORGE,What's the massage situation?
6,10,76,BONNIE,What do you mean?
6,10,76,GEORGE,"Is there any work being done? Is there any rubbing, touching, finger"
6,10,77,BONNIE,"George, would you just stop?"
6,10,77,GEORGE,"Say you go to the bathroom at two o'clock in the morning, what's the"
6,10,78,BONNIE,"George, what is wrong with you?"
6,10,78,GEORGE,"I'll tell you what's wrong, a grown woman with a male roommate! It's"
6,10,80,SCOTT,Hey!
6,10,80,GEORGE,Hey!
6,10,80,SCOTT,How ya going?
6,10,80,GEORGE,I'm good.
6,10,80,SCOTT,Are you gonna need the bathroom? 'Cause I'm gonna jump in
6,10,81,BONNIE,"No, just throw my bras out of the way."
6,10,82,TIM,"Well, this is my building."
6,10,82,ELAINE,Yes it is.
6,10,82,TIM,"This was fun, you know?"
6,10,82,ELAINE,Yeah.
6,10,82,TIM,"So, I'll call."
6,10,82,ELAINE,Aren't you gonna invite me upstairs?
6,10,82,TIM,Upstairs? You wanna go upstairs?
6,10,82,ELAINE,I would love to go upstairs.
6,10,82,TIM,"Elaine, you are something else. No one can ever put a label on you, huh?"
6,10,82,ELAINE,We'll see.
6,10,83,JERRY,Newman. He's going with Newman.
6,10,83,GEORGE,How does Tim Whatley even know Newman?
6,10,83,JERRY,Newman's his mailman.
6,10,83,GEORGE,Who goes to the Super Bowl with their mailman?!
6,10,83,JERRY,Who goes *anywhere* with Newman?!
6,10,83,GEORGE,"Well, he's merry."
6,10,83,JERRY,"He is merry, I'll give him that."
6,10,84,GEORGE,I had a little tiff with Bonnie about the roommate.
6,10,84,JERRY,"Oh, well the cactus will smooth things over."
6,10,85,ELAINE,"Hey, guess what? I'm going to the Super Bowl with Tim Whatley."
6,10,85,JERRY,What?
6,10,85,ELAINE,We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket.
6,10,85,JERRY,What about the label maker?
6,10,85,ELAINE,"Ah, well."
6,10,85,JERRY,"Wait a minute, that's my ticket! You didn't even want to go."
6,10,85,ELAINE,"It was totally out of the blue. We went upstairs to his apartment, you"
6,10,86,JERRY,"So, how did you get up there? Did you say you had to use the bathroom?"
6,10,86,ELAINE,No.
6,10,86,JERRY,Then how'd you get up there?
6,10,86,ELAINE,"I said, ""Do you wanna go upstairs?"""
6,10,86,GEORGE,And there's you ticket.
6,10,86,ELAINE,What?
6,10,86,JERRY,That's why you're going to the Super Bowl.
6,10,86,ELAINE,Why?
6,10,86,JERRY,"You go out with a guy one time, you ask him to go upstairs like you're"
6,10,87,ELAINE,"You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's going"
6,10,88,JERRY,Obviously.
6,10,88,ELAINE,You're crazy.
6,10,88,GEORGE,"Well, what happened when you got upstairs?"
6,10,88,ELAINE,"As soon as we walked in, he got a call from one of his patients with an"
6,10,90,JERRY,"Yeah, well I don't trust this guy. I think he regifted, he degifted,"
6,10,93,KRAMER,Hey.
6,10,93,JERRY,Hey. What are you doing?
6,10,93,KRAMER,I'm watching your door.
6,10,93,JERRY,My door?
6,10,93,KRAMER,"Yeah, from my peephole. Fisheye, sees all."
6,10,96,JERRY,What was that?
6,10,96,KRAMER,Newman!
6,10,98,NEWMAN,Damn!
6,10,98,JERRY,The bedroom!
6,10,100,JERRY,"I see you, Newman! I see you!"
6,10,100,KRAMER,I'm taking the Congo as a penalty!
6,10,101,ELAINE,I've got a confession to make.
6,10,101,TIM,Oh? What's that?
6,10,101,ELAINE,I've got Super Bowl fever.
6,10,101,TIM,"Oh yeah, me too."
6,10,101,ELAINE,So where are we staying?
6,10,101,TIM,"Oh, the Ambassador."
6,10,101,ELAINE,Oh. Big room?
6,10,101,TIM,"It's a regular room, but it's right downtown."
6,10,101,ELAINE,Downtown?
6,10,101,TIM,Right downtown.
6,10,101,ELAINE,"What do they have there, a couple of beds?"
6,10,101,TIM,Why? You bringing someone else?
6,10,101,ELAINE,"No, but don't you think there should be two beds? There's two of us."
6,10,103,BONNIE,"Oh, a cactus."
6,10,103,GEORGE,"They don't need any water, so you don't have to keep taking them to the"
6,10,106,SCOTT,"Well, look who's here."
6,10,106,BONNIE,I asked Scott to move out.
6,10,106,GEORGE,Oh. Oh!
6,10,108,JERRY,So she kicked him out of the apartment.
6,10,108,GEORGE,That's right. It's just me and her.
6,10,108,JERRY,"Wow, she rearranged her whole life for you."
6,10,108,GEORGE,"I guess she did. He's gone, now I'm the man."
6,10,108,JERRY,That's not a good role for you.
6,10,108,GEORGE,"No, it's not."
6,10,108,JERRY,You unwittingly made a major commitment. That's a lot of pressure.
6,10,108,GEORGE,Oh my god.
6,10,108,JERRY,"You wanted to be ensconced in velvet, you're buried."
6,10,108,GEORGE,"I had the perfect situation here, he was shouldering half the load."
6,10,108,JERRY,He was shouldering.
6,10,108,GEORGE,I couldn't leave well enough alone?!
6,10,108,JERRY,Where are you going?
6,10,108,GEORGE,I gotta go help her tape up all his boxes and get them ready for
6,10,109,JERRY,"Oh, well here. Take Whatley's label maker, I don't want to see it"
6,10,110,GEORGE,Thanks.
6,10,110,KRAMER,Yeah. I am taking over South America and there
6,10,111,JERRY,"So, too bad about that Super Bowl ticket, eh Newman?"
6,10,111,NEWMAN,Yeah. I just hope Tim Whatley's electric bills don't suddenly get lost
6,10,112,JERRY,"Thanks for having me over, guys."
6,10,113,JERRY,"Alright, I'll see you later."
6,10,113,TIM,Hey Jerry?
6,10,113,JERRY,"Ah, Tim Whatley. Out scalping?"
6,10,113,TIM,"Ah, see, now I've been thinking a lot about what happened and I feel"
6,10,114,JERRY,"Are you serious, what about Elaine?"
6,10,114,TIM,"Oh, Elaine. Yeah, well, things just didn't work out like I thought they"
6,10,115,JERRY,"Oh. Hey, isn't this"
6,10,116,KRAMER,What?! Not my car!! Hey!! They're towing my
6,10,119,NEWMAN,What are you doing?
6,10,119,KRAMER,I'm taking the board with me.
6,10,123,TIM,"So, I guess I'll see you at the game."
6,10,123,JERRY,"Yeah, see you there."
6,10,125,BONNIE,"Hi, George."
6,10,125,GEORGE,"What, what happened? Where's, where's all the stuff?"
6,10,125,BONNIE,It's gone. It was all his. Is this a label maker?
6,10,125,GEORGE,"The table, the stereo, the VCR, the velvet couch, where's the velvet?"
6,10,125,BONNIE,"They were his. Besides, we don't need any of those things. We have"
6,10,127,NEWMAN,Are you sure you know where the impound yard is?
6,10,127,KRAMER,"Oh, stop stalling. Come on."
6,10,127,NEWMAN,"I can't think, there's all this noise."
6,10,127,KRAMER,Or is it because I've built a stronghold around Greenland? I've driven
6,10,129,NEWMAN,I'm not beaten yet. I still have armies in the Ukraine.
6,10,130,KRAMER,"Ha ha, the Ukraine. Do you know what the Ukraine is? It's a sitting"
6,10,132,UKRAINIAN,I come from Ukraine. You not say Ukraine weak.
6,10,132,KRAMER,"Yeah, well we're playing a game here, pal."
6,10,132,UKRAINIAN,Ukraine is game to you?! Howbout I take your little board and smash
6,10,136,ELAINE,"Hello, Tim."
6,10,136,TIM,"Elaine, hi."
6,10,136,ELAINE,"Don't worry, Tim. I didn't come by to yell at you, I didn't come by"
6,10,138,TIM,But you gave it to me.
6,10,138,ELAINE,"But you gave me a ticket to the Super Bowl. Hand it over, Whatley."
6,10,138,TIM,"Uh, ok."
6,10,138,ELAINE,"You don't have the label maker, do you?"
6,10,138,TIM,"Uh, no."
6,10,138,ELAINE,I knew it! You're a regifter!
6,10,138,TIM,"Oh, yeah, some gift. That thing didn't work at all."
6,10,138,ELAINE,What?
6,10,138,TIM,"You put a label on something, then ten minutes later it would peel right"
6,10,139,ELAINE,"Well, I bought it for you because you were so nice to"
6,10,141,TIM,"Oh, Elaine!"
6,10,147,JERRY,
6,10,147,NEWMAN,"Hello, Jerry. Tim couldn't make it, he's in love. Isn't that"
6,10,148,JERRY,"Oh, it's enchanting."
6,10,149,BONNIE,Hi.
6,10,149,GEORGE,Here's the TV. I know you wanted to watch the Super Bowl. Do you at
6,10,150,BONNIE,"George, Scott's gonna drop by. He said he never got his boxes. I'll"
6,10,151,GEORGE,"How am I gonna get out of this? Think Costanza, think!"
6,10,151,BONNIE,Here we are.
6,10,151,GEORGE,"Hey, do you know, Bonnie, I just had a pretty wild idea."
6,10,151,BONNIE,What is it?
6,10,151,GEORGE,"Well I, uh, I'm not sure how you pronounce it or anything, but I, uh, I"
6,10,152,BONNIE,What?
