6,12,0,THE SCOFFLAW,Written by Peter Mehlman
6,12,1,JERRY,"The big new accessory with eyeglasses, seems to be that strap, that connects in the back so you can take 'em on and off. Which I don't get, because I thought, if you have glasses, isn't that because you need to wear glasses? 'You need glasses', isn't that what they say? I mean, an eye doctor doesn't say 'Would you care for some glasses?' When people have crutches, they don't havelike a little chain attached to their belt, so they can just let go of 'em every now and then. Why not get a toupee with a rubber band for when you're water-skiing, the thing could just..."
6,12,3,GARY,Hey George.
6,12,3,GEORGE,"Gary? Well, well, well well. Where the hell've you been? I've been"
6,12,4,GARY,I know. I've been pretty busy.
6,12,4,GEORGE,"Busy. Don't give me busy. Who's not busy? I'm busy, we're all busy,"
6,12,5,GARY,"Mostly chemotherapy. 'Kay, I'll see you."
6,12,9,KRAMER,Hey pig!
6,12,11,COP,Hey! Hey! Hey!
6,12,13,JERRY,So you called the cop a pig?
6,12,13,KRAMER,I was yelling at the litterbug. I mean this is my town. You don't throw
6,12,14,JERRY,Didn't you explain that to the cop?
6,12,14,KRAMER,"No, I fled the scene."
6,12,15,JERRY,Hey.
6,12,15,KRAMER,Hey buddy.
6,12,15,GEORGE,"Hey, uh..."
6,12,15,KRAMER,What?
6,12,15,GEORGE,"Kramer, I, I, I, uh, I need to talk to Jerry privately."
6,12,15,KRAMER,Oh. What about?
6,12,15,GEORGE,Kramer...
6,12,15,KRAMER,"Aw come on George, you can share it with me, huh?"
6,12,16,GEORGE,"Hey, you're hurting me!"
6,12,16,KRAMER,"You gonna share it with me next time, huh?"
6,12,16,GEORGE,"I swear, I swear!"
6,12,16,KRAMER,"Aw, all right, I'm looking forward to it."
6,12,19,GEORGE,"Right, I got news. You ready? Gary Fogel had cancer."
6,12,19,JERRY,"Oh yeah, I knew."
6,12,19,GEORGE,You knew? How did you know?
6,12,19,JERRY,He told me a few months ago.
6,12,19,GEORGE,Why did he tell you and not me?
6,12,19,JERRY,I don't know.
6,12,19,GEORGE,How are you closer to him than me?
6,12,20,GEORGE,"So, is he okay?"
6,12,20,JERRY,"Oh yeah, he's fine, fine. He was in bad shape for a while though."
6,12,20,GEORGE,"Huh, really? How bad? Was he on his death bed?"
6,12,20,JERRY,"No, he was on his regular bed."
6,12,20,GEORGE,So why didn't you tell me?
6,12,20,JERRY,He swore me to secrecy.
6,12,20,GEORGE,So?
6,12,20,JERRY,It's not like you're my wife.
6,12,20,GEORGE,"Well, I still think you shoulda told me."
6,12,20,JERRY,"Hey, believe me, you were better off not knowing. It's not easy to deal"
6,12,22,GEORGE,"Well, I wanna talk to him about this."
6,12,22,JERRY,"That's right, you let him have it."
6,12,22,GEORGE,Mmm-mm.
6,12,22,JERRY,Who is he not to tell you about his life-threatening illness?
6,12,22,GEORGE,That's what I'm saying.
6,12,22,JERRY,His illness is your business.
6,12,22,GEORGE,"If not mine, whose?"
6,12,22,JERRY,"If not now, when?"
6,12,23,ELAINE,Were you just talking about me?
6,12,23,GEORGE,"No, an old friend of ours, Gary."
6,12,23,ELAINE,"Oh, the guy with cancer?"
6,12,23,GEORGE,You told her? She's not your wife!
6,12,23,JERRY,"If I told you, you woulda given it away."
6,12,23,GEORGE,You don't think I can keep a secret?
6,12,23,JERRY,"No, but he would've read your face."
6,12,23,GEORGE,You don't trust my poker face?
6,12,23,JERRY,Do you ever win at poker?
6,12,23,GEORGE,No.
6,12,24,KRAMER,"Hey. Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV."
6,12,24,ELAINE,"Egh, Jake Jarmel?"
6,12,24,KRAMER,Yeah. I really liked those glasses he was wearing. Where'd he get those.
6,12,24,ELAINE,Why? You don't wear glasses.
6,12,24,KRAMER,"I know, I know. But I need a new look, I'm stagnating."
6,12,24,GEORGE,"I have to say, as a glasses wearer I take exception to that. That's like"
6,12,25,KRAMER,"Yeah, I've considered that. Look, how do I get in touch with"
6,12,26,ELAINE,"Well, he's having a two day book signing at Waldens."
6,12,26,KRAMER,Ah.
6,12,26,ELAINE,"You know, we had a really bad break-up."
6,12,26,JERRY,The Jujy Fruits?
6,12,26,ELAINE,"Yeah, the Jujy Fruits."
6,12,30,JAKE,"Okay, K-Man, enjoy the book."
6,12,30,KRAMER,"Okay, thank you. Listen Jake, uh, where did you get those eyeglass"
6,12,31,JAKE,I can't tell you that.
6,12,31,KRAMER,So you don't know where you got 'em?
6,12,31,JAKE,Yes I do. But I don't want anyone else to have them.
6,12,31,KRAMER,"Well, that's peculiar."
6,12,34,GEORGE,"Eh, there's that woman that never talks to anybody."
6,12,34,GARY,Really?
6,12,34,GEORGE,"Every day she comes in, she sits at that table and reads. Never talks to"
6,12,35,GARY,"Oh, I talked to Debby Bibelo. She said to say hi."
6,12,35,GEORGE,"Really? You know Gary, I really have"
6,12,36,GARY,"Well frankly, you can't keep a secret. You know, you'd get two pair, the"
6,12,37,GEORGE,Well I still think it was wrong.
6,12,37,GARY,"Right, well I'm sorry, all right. I guess I was just thinking of myself."
6,12,37,GEORGE,Yes.
6,12,39,KRAMER,"...so I called the litterbug a pig, not you. I like policeman. I wanted"
6,12,40,COP,Yeah? So why didn't you?
6,12,40,KRAMER,Scared of being shot.
6,12,40,COP,"Mr Kramer, let me tell you a story. In nineteen-seventy-nine I ticketed a"
6,12,46,KRAMER,I like that eye patch.
6,12,47,GEORGE,"All right, I'm gonna move my car, my meter's up. Can't park in"
6,12,48,GARY,"Hey, George, listen. You know that company I work for, they own"
6,12,49,GEORGE,"Wha, that's a Kinney lot?"
6,12,49,GARY,"Yeah, and there's a space opening up, and I could get it for you. You just"
6,12,50,GEORGE,"Fifty bucks a month, that's incredible! Okay, thanks."
6,12,50,GARY,"All right, I got lunch, all right."
6,12,50,GEORGE,You still owe me a secret.
6,12,50,GARY,"All right, listen. There is something I haven't told you, all right?"
6,12,50,GEORGE,Yeah?
6,12,50,GARY,"Yeah, but uhm, you can't tell Jerry."
6,12,50,GEORGE,What do think I tell Jerry everything? It's not like he's my wife.
6,12,50,GARY,"Okay. Well, the thing is, I've been living a lie."
6,12,50,GEORGE,Just one? I'm living like twenty. What's yours?
6,12,50,GARY,"Well, I I never actually had cancer. I'll see you."
6,12,54,ELAINE,So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?
6,12,54,KRAMER,Flat out refused!
6,12,54,ELAINE,"Yeah, isn't that just like him? You know,"
6,12,55,KRAMER,"Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister."
6,12,56,ELAINE,What? You told Jake I
6,12,57,KRAMER,Yeah.
6,12,57,ELAINE,I can't believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said hi? I never
6,12,58,JERRY,I never heard her say hi.
6,12,58,KRAMER,"Well, it's uh, common courtesy."
6,12,58,ELAINE,"No, no. Kramer, you don't understand. He made the last"
6,12,60,JERRY,It's like a game of tag.
6,12,61,JERRY,Where you going?
6,12,61,ELAINE,Nowhere.
6,12,61,JERRY,"You're going to the book store to see Jake Jarmel, aren't you?"
6,12,61,ELAINE,So what if I do?
6,12,61,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, listen. If you're going there,"
6,12,64,JERRY,Hey. How'd it go with Gary?
6,12,64,GEORGE,"Fine, fine."
6,12,64,JERRY,Really?
6,12,64,GEORGE,Yeah.
6,12,64,JERRY,You look like something's on your mind.
6,12,64,GEORGE,No. Nothing. Fine.
6,12,64,JERRY,"So, that's your poker face."
6,12,64,GEORGE,My regular face.
6,12,64,JERRY,No it isn't. I've seen your regular face. That is not it.
6,12,64,GEORGE,What are you saying?
6,12,64,JERRY,"All right George, c'mon, what d'you got?"
6,12,64,GEORGE,I got nothing.
6,12,64,JERRY,"What you got, a pair of bullets?"
6,12,64,GEORGE,What you talking about?
6,12,64,JERRY,Two pair? Three of a kind?
6,12,64,GEORGE,Will you stop it?
6,12,64,JERRY,"Oh my God, you got a flush! You're holding a flush!"
6,12,64,GEORGE,I don't have a flush.
6,12,64,JERRY,"A full house? You got a full house? Turn 'em over George, I wanna see"
6,12,65,GEORGE,Gary Fogel never had cancer!
6,12,68,ELAINE,"So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me. When"
6,12,69,JAKE,You're saying you didn't say hi.
6,12,69,ELAINE,That's what I'm saying.
6,12,69,JAKE,So that's what you came down here to tell me?
6,12,69,ELAINE,Correct.
6,12,69,JAKE,You never said hi?
6,12,69,ELAINE,Correct.
6,12,69,JAKE,"You still like me, don't you?"
6,12,69,ELAINE,Correct. What's that?
6,12,69,MAN,"Hey, I have been trying to get this book signed all day."
6,12,69,ELAINE,How can you say that
6,12,70,JAKE,"Elaine, coming down here to say that you didn't say hi is more of a"
6,12,71,ELAINE,"Ah, Jake... I, uh..."
6,12,72,GEORGE,"The doctors thought he had cancer, but the surgery revealed he never"
6,12,73,JERRY,So what was wrong with him?
6,12,73,GEORGE,Nothing!
6,12,73,JERRY,So he's been lying to me for two months?!
6,12,73,GEORGE,That's right.
6,12,73,JERRY,What kind of person is this? There's only one other person who might be
6,12,74,GEORGE,Well...
6,12,74,JERRY,I don't even think you could do it.
6,12,74,GEORGE,"Oh, I could do it."
6,12,74,JERRY,"Yeah, I guess you could."
6,12,74,GEORGE,C'mon.
6,12,74,JERRY,Did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get
6,12,76,GEORGE,You did that?
6,12,76,JERRY,"Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy."
6,12,76,GEORGE,"Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't say anything. (rushes to take"
6,12,77,JERRY,Why not?
6,12,77,GEORGE,"Because he'll know I told you. Besides, he's giving"
6,12,78,JERRY,"So you're telling me, because you're getting free parking, I gotta"
6,12,79,GEORGE,Yeah.
6,12,79,JERRY,"Well I don't like it. I don't like it one bit! And, I'm supposed to see"
6,12,80,GEORGE,"Yeah, well you have to maintain the same disposition too. You can't"
6,12,81,JERRY,Why didn't he tell me?
6,12,81,GEORGE,Because you were being so nice.
6,12,81,JERRY,I don't think I can be that nice.
6,12,81,GEORGE,You be nice!
6,12,86,JERRY,Gary?
6,12,86,GARY,"What d'you think? Check it out. (he tries a number of expressions, turning"
6,12,87,JERRY,Is that from my gift certificate?
6,12,87,GARY,Yeah buddy. You really came through for me man. You've been so nice.
6,12,88,JERRY,"Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage."
6,12,88,GARY,"Hey, you know what I'm thinking of doing? I'm getting rid of all my"
6,12,89,JERRY,I don't think so.
6,12,89,GARY,"Oh come on, open up. Let me take a look."
6,12,91,GEORGE,You be nice! He's giving me a parking space parking
6,12,93,GARY,"Well, what d'you know. Hey, lookee there, you're loaded."
6,12,93,JERRY,Okay.
6,12,93,GARY,"Hey, look who's over there. Miss Cool-toes. Check this out, Jack!"
6,12,94,KRAMER,Hey buddy.
6,12,94,JERRY,Hey. Look at you. Wha... what's this?
6,12,94,KRAMER,It's an eyepatch.
6,12,94,JERRY,You look like a pirate.
6,12,94,KRAMER,I wanna be a pirate.
6,12,94,JERRY,This is Gary.
6,12,94,KRAMER,How you doing?
6,12,94,GARY,All right.
6,12,98,KRAMER,"Well, I tell you there's only one problem."
6,12,100,JERRY,Can't see on your right side?
6,12,100,KRAMER,"No. It's uh, it's itchy"
6,12,101,DEBBY,Nice car.
6,12,101,GEORGE,Yeah. Once belonged to Jon Voight.
6,12,101,DEBBY,"So, what made you just call me out of the blue like that?"
6,12,101,GEORGE,"Oh, well, uh. Gary told me you said hi."
6,12,101,DEBBY,I didn't say hi.
6,12,101,GEORGE,You didn't?
6,12,101,DEBBY,"Uh, no. I told him to send you my regards. I didn't say hi."
6,12,101,GEORGE,Regards?
6,12,101,DEBBY,"Yeah, regards."
6,12,102,ELAINE,"Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't"
6,12,104,CABBIE,Smugness is not a good quality.
6,12,104,ELAINE,Oh my God. That man over there. I think he's
6,12,107,CABBIE,Good. Revenge is very good.
6,12,110,ELAINE,'Scuse me! 'Scuse me. Excuse
6,12,111,GUY,Yes?
6,12,111,ELAINE,"Uh. Ah, if you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got"
6,12,112,GUY,Malaysia.
6,12,112,ELAINE,Malaysia?
6,12,112,GUY,Yeah.
6,12,112,ELAINE,"Uhm, look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?"
6,12,112,GUY,"Actually, I was gonna buy a new pair."
6,12,112,ELAINE,Oh!
6,12,112,GUY,"But I, I can barely see without these."
6,12,112,ELAINE,C'mon.
6,12,112,GUY,"Well, these were expensive."
6,12,112,ELAINE,Let's start the bidding.
6,12,113,GEORGE,"So, you didn't think this was a date?"
6,12,113,DEBBY,
6,12,113,GEORGE,I thought it was a date.
6,12,113,DEBBY,No. It's not a date.
6,12,113,GEORGE,What about the regards?
6,12,113,DEBBY,"Regards don't mean anything. I mean, it's not like I said hi. Hey, the"
6,12,114,GEORGE,"No, tell me."
6,12,114,DEBBY,Can you keep a secret?
6,12,114,GEORGE,Me? Oh yeah.
6,12,114,DEBBY,"I never had feelings for Gary until he got sick. But, h..."
6,12,116,GEORGE,"Oh, the guy's got some perspective there."
6,12,118,JERRY,"Hey, do you know what the Whip does?"
6,12,118,KRAMER,What whip?
6,12,118,JERRY,"The Whip. In the Senate, in the House."
6,12,118,KRAMER,"Well, you know in the old days, when the senators didn't vote the way"
6,12,122,GARY,"She won't talk to anyone, huh? Oh no, she won't say a word to anybody."
6,12,125,COP,"Well, well. The 'white whale'."
6,12,127,GEORGE,"Oh, look at this. There's no place to park around here. I"
6,12,128,DEBBY,"Don't complain, at least you have your health."
6,12,132,DEBBY,"George, look out for that man!"
6,12,139,COP,"Hey! Hey, get back here!"
6,12,139,KRAMER,Newman! The white whale!
6,12,140,GEORGE,Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?
6,12,140,JERRY,Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig? Would
6,12,141,GEORGE,No. Definitely not.
6,12,141,JERRY,Yeah.
6,12,141,GEORGE,I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.
6,12,141,JERRY,And you know what else? He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.
6,12,141,GEORGE,The one who always sits by herself?
6,12,141,JERRY,Yeah!
6,12,141,GEORGE,How did he do that?
6,12,141,JERRY,Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.
6,12,141,GEORGE,Really? And Debby told me that she fell in love with him because he has
6,12,142,JERRY,"She thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness, so he can get"
6,12,143,GEORGE,He picked her up?
6,12,143,JERRY,Walked right over to her table.
6,12,143,GEORGE,"Wow. (he runs his fingers through his hair, and then brushes the"
6,12,147,ELAINE,"Jake, Jake. Take a look. Aaw, see,"
6,12,148,JAKE,Where did you get those?
6,12,148,ELAINE,Malaysia. I was in the area.
6,12,151,NEWMAN,Kramer.
6,12,151,KRAMER,Just drive.
6,12,152,KRAMER,"All right. Now you listen, and you listen good. I know who you are. You're"
6,12,153,NEWMAN,What're you talking about...
6,12,153,KRAMER,"Ah, don't play dumb. It's me, Cosmo."
6,12,153,NEWMAN,"All right, so it's me. So what?"
6,12,153,KRAMER,"You don't think I know how you're feeling, every second of the day?"
6,12,155,NEWMAN,"I can't sleep, I tell you! I can't sleep!"
6,12,155,KRAMER,"Ga, of course you can't, you poor sap! Now why didn't you tell me?"
6,12,155,NEWMAN,I couldn't. I couldn't tell anyone.
6,12,155,KRAMER,So you been living this secret the whole time by yourself?
6,12,155,NEWMAN,"Yes, it's been awful. I wanted to tell somebody."
6,12,156,KRAMER,"All right, all right, I'm gonna help you."
6,12,158,GEORGE,I'll try some on and see how they look. It's just hair.
6,12,158,JERRY,You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? You got your natural
6,12,160,GEORGE,"Well, some of 'em look good. The ones that look good you don't even know"
6,12,161,JERRY,What if you get involved with a woman? How're you gonna tell her?
6,12,161,GEORGE,"The way they make 'em these days, I'll never have to tell her."
6,12,161,JERRY,"So you keep it a secret your whole life, then at your funeral the"
6,12,165,LIPPMAN,"It's no secret that it's my dream to have my own publishing house, and"
6,12,168,ELAINE,"Oh, Mr Lippman. That is so exciting. I mean, you have"
6,12,169,LIPPMAN,"Yeah, by the way, those are great glasses."
6,12,169,ELAINE,"Oh really, you like 'em?"
6,12,169,LIPPMAN,Uh huh. Very unusual.
6,12,169,ELAINE,"Well, you know what?"
6,12,169,LIPPMAN,What?
6,12,169,ELAINE,You can have 'em.
6,12,169,LIPPMAN,"Oh, no no no. Please."
6,12,169,ELAINE,"No no no no. Go to that place on the corner, they'll change the"
6,12,170,LIPPMAN,Really?
6,12,170,ELAINE,"Yeah, I've no use for them anymore. Honestly."
6,12,170,LIPPMAN,I could use a new pair of reading glasses.
6,12,170,ELAINE,They're from Malaysia.
6,12,170,LIPPMAN,Oh yeah?
6,12,170,ELAINE,Fabulous.
6,12,173,JUDGE,"Well Mr Newman, in all my years on the bench, I have never come across"
6,12,177,JUDGE,...convenient to your home.
6,12,177,NEWMAN,I can't afford that!
6,12,177,JUDGE,"Afford it you will, Mr Newman. Or this court will see that your car is"
6,12,179,JUDGE,...and sold at auction.
6,12,179,KRAMER,"Well, don't you worry, your honour. He's in my custody."
6,12,184,GEORGE,"Well, what d'you think?"
6,12,184,JERRY,
6,12,184,GEORGE,"No, say. I want you to say."
6,12,184,JERRY,"It's not good, okay. It's not good. You look stupid."
6,12,185,SALESMAN,You have to realise this has not been custom-fitted to his scalp.
6,12,185,GEORGE,I really think this looks pretty good.
6,12,185,JERRY,"Why don't you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami Beach and get"
6,12,186,GEORGE,"Well, maybe you could show me something else."
6,12,186,SALESMAN,"As I said, it'll be different once we design something specifically"
6,12,187,JERRY,"Oh, hey, I'm being helpful. I am the only one being helpful!"
