6,13,0,THE KISS HELLO,Written by Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld
6,13,1,JERRY,"Now, I was thinking the other day about hair, and that the weird thing about it, is that people will touch other people's hair. You will actually kiss another human being, right on the head. But, if one of those hairs should somehow be able to get out of that skull, and go off on its own, it is now the vilest, most disgusting thing that you can encounter. The same hair. People freak out. ""There was a hair, in the egg salad!"""
6,13,3,GEORGE,Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You
6,13,4,JERRY,I would think.
6,13,4,GEORGE,"So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for"
6,13,5,JERRY,You don't flamenco on the first date.
6,13,5,GEORGE,"Boy, I wish the flamenco was popular here."
6,13,5,JERRY,Yeah? Would you do it?
6,13,5,GEORGE,"Yes, I think I would."
6,13,5,JERRY,"Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the"
6,13,7,JERRY,"Hello. Oh, hi Nana. What? Oh. Oh, alright, okay. Don't worry about it. Okay, I'll see you later. Alright, bye."
6,13,8,JERRY,I have to go over to my grandmother's.
6,13,8,GEORGE,What for?
6,13,8,JERRY,I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.
6,13,8,GEORGE,"So, what, no lunch?"
6,13,8,JERRY,"No, we have time."
6,13,8,GEORGE,Oh. How's she doing?
6,13,10,JERRY,"Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has"
6,13,11,GEORGE,"Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups. They should make it in a tube."
6,13,11,JERRY,Like toothpaste?
6,13,11,GEORGE,Ya-hah.
6,13,14,JERRY,There's a squeeze ketchup.
6,13,14,GEORGE,I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.
6,13,14,JERRY,"Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason"
6,13,15,GEORGE,Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.
6,13,15,JERRY,I really don't see the difference.
6,13,15,GEORGE,"Oh, there's a difference. It's subtle."
6,13,15,JERRY,It's subtle.
6,13,15,GEORGE,"Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?"
6,13,15,JERRY,"Yeah, there she is. Uh-oh."
6,13,15,GEORGE,What?
6,13,16,JERRY,"Ah, she's with her friend Wendy."
6,13,16,GEORGE,"Wendy? Is that the uh, physical therapist?"
6,13,16,JERRY,Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.
6,13,16,GEORGE,Really?
6,13,16,JERRY,"Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did"
6,13,20,ELAINE,Hey.
6,13,20,GEORGE,"You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia."
6,13,20,JERRY,"Ah, that's fortunate. I really admire that."
6,13,20,GEORGE,Huh. I never heard you say you admire me for
6,13,21,JERRY,"No, I told you I admire your hearing."
6,13,22,JERRY,"No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing."
6,13,25,ELAINE,"Wendy, George. Wendy."
6,13,26,GEORGE,"You're uh, physical therapist, right?"
6,13,26,WENDY,Yes.
6,13,26,GEORGE,"You know, I got this little swelling right here. (rolls up his"
6,13,29,ELAINE,George.
6,13,29,WENDY,Have you tried heat and ice on it?
6,13,29,GEORGE,"Oh that uh, that seems like a lotta trouble."
6,13,29,WENDY,"Well, you could come by my office later, I could work on it for"
6,13,30,GEORGE,Oh! Okay.
6,13,30,WENDY,Let me give you my card.
6,13,31,GEORGE,"Oh, thank you."
6,13,31,WENDY,"Well, I'll see you guys later. Nice meeting you. Bye"
6,13,32,ELAINE,Bye Wendy. I'm sorry.
6,13,32,WENDY,Bye Jerry.
6,13,33,JERRY,Bye.
6,13,33,ELAINE,What did you do that for?
6,13,33,GEORGE,What?
6,13,33,ELAINE,Ask about your arm.
6,13,35,GEORGE,I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.
6,13,35,ELAINE,She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal
6,13,36,GEORGE,Why not?
6,13,37,ELAINE,"Because, it is what she does."
6,13,37,GEORGE,"I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions. (getting"
6,13,40,ELAINE,"George, you got a little something, right here."
6,13,41,GEORGE,People think they're so
6,13,42,JERRY,"Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my"
6,13,43,ELAINE,Why?
6,13,43,JERRY,"Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I"
6,13,45,GEORGE,What're you getting?
6,13,45,JERRY,"And what's with that hairdo, by the way?"
6,13,45,ELAINE,"Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering."
6,13,45,JERRY,She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You
6,13,46,ELAINE,"Oh, I could never say anything to her about that."
6,13,46,JERRY,Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like
6,13,47,ELAINE,Yeah. Hah.
6,13,47,GEORGE,"Well, just tell Kramer to tell her."
6,13,47,ELAINE,"No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it."
6,13,47,JERRY,"What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come"
6,13,48,ELAINE,"Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's"
6,13,50,ELAINE,...Kramer.
6,13,51,KRAMER,"Hello, boys and girls."
6,13,51,JERRY,Speak of the devil.
6,13,53,KRAMER,"Yeah. Hey listen, I uh, I need a picture of you, buddy."
6,13,53,JERRY,What for?
6,13,53,KRAMER,"Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby"
6,13,54,JERRY,Why?
6,13,54,KRAMER,"So everyone will know everybody's name. See, people are gonna"
6,13,55,JERRY,
6,13,56,KRAMER,"Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say ""Hey,"
6,13,58,JERRY,"Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with"
6,13,59,KRAMER,You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do
6,13,60,ELAINE,Yeah. This is gonna work out just
6,13,63,LEO,Ma! Again with the ketchup? Don't they have 'em in the plastic
6,13,65,LEO,Jerry! Hello!
6,13,65,JERRY,"Hello, uncle Leo!"
6,13,65,LEO,What're you doing here?
6,13,65,JERRY,Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.
6,13,65,LEO,"Yeah, me too."
6,13,66,NANA,Hello Jerry.
6,13,66,JERRY,Hi Nana.
6,13,67,LEO,Aren't you gonna kiss her hello?
6,13,67,JERRY,Yes. Yes of course.
6,13,67,NANA,"Ha, well, here's the bottle."
6,13,68,LEO,I'll do it.
6,13,68,JERRY,"What're you doing, I got it."
6,13,69,LEO,Give it to me.
6,13,69,JERRY,Will you stop it.
6,13,69,LEO,"Jerry, will you give me the bottle?"
6,13,69,JERRY,Uncle Leo! Alright! Take it!
6,13,69,NANA,You should let Buddy open it.
6,13,69,LEO,Buddy? He lived next door to us forty-five years ago.
6,13,70,NANA,"Leo, did you give Helen the fifty dollars?"
6,13,70,LEO,What fifty dollars?
6,13,70,NANA,"Your father won a thousand dollars at the track last week, and he"
6,13,72,LEO,"Ma, dad died in nineteen-sixty-two."
6,13,73,LEO,Believe me. I don't owe your
6,13,79,JERRY,I'm just not getting any hot water.
6,13,79,JULIO,"Hey, believe me, I know there's nothing worse than when your"
6,13,80,JERRY,"Thanks, Julio."
6,13,80,JULIO,Awright.
6,13,84,JERRY,Huh?
6,13,84,KRAMER,"Hey, hey hey hey. Hello!"
6,13,84,JERRY,What's going on here?
6,13,84,KRAMER,"Ohh, nothing, nothing."
6,13,84,JERRY,"Well, then what're you doing?"
6,13,84,KRAMER,"Oh, I, I need a pen."
6,13,84,JERRY,What for?
6,13,84,KRAMER,"Well, I'm making out my will. Oh, I got a big slice of dough"
6,13,85,JERRY,"You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?"
6,13,85,KRAMER,You got that straight.
6,13,85,JERRY,"I told you, forget it."
6,13,85,KRAMER,"Oh, come on, Jerry. If everybody knew everybody, we wouldn't"
6,13,87,JERRY,You're robbing me.
6,13,87,KRAMER,"Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate"
6,13,89,ELAINE,Wha... W.. Are you going home?
6,13,89,KRAMER,Yeah.
6,13,89,ELAINE,"Uh, could you come back in about five minutes?"
6,13,89,KRAMER,Why?
6,13,89,ELAINE,No reason. Just wanna see you again.
6,13,92,JERRY,So? Are you sure Wendy's coming?
6,13,92,ELAINE,"Yeah, she'll be here any second."
6,13,92,JERRY,"Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer"
6,13,93,ELAINE,"Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her"
6,13,95,JERRY,"Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to"
6,13,104,MORTY,Do you know what the interest on that fifty dollars comes to
6,13,105,HELEN,"Oh, Morty, please."
6,13,105,MORTY,Six hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-five cents. And
6,13,107,HELEN,"Morty, will you stop it!"
6,13,107,MORTY,"Well, he's not getting away with this!"
6,13,109,JERRY,Yeah?
6,13,109,WENDY,Wendy.
6,13,109,JERRY,Come on up.
6,13,110,ELAINE,"Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?"
6,13,110,JERRY,"No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first"
6,13,111,ELAINE,What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's
6,13,112,JERRY,"It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in,"
6,13,114,ELAINE,How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be?
6,13,114,JERRY,"Elaine, now you're being ridiculous."
6,13,115,ELAINE,That's her. That's her.
6,13,118,ELAINE/WENDY,Hi/Hey.
6,13,120,JERRY,Hi Wendy.
6,13,120,WENDY,"Oh, hi Jerry."
6,13,121,JERRY,Would you like something to drink?
6,13,121,WENDY,Sure.
6,13,122,JERRY,There you go.
6,13,122,WENDY,Ah.
6,13,125,JERRY,"Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars."
6,13,128,JERRY,"So, how's everything going?"
6,13,128,WENDY,"Oh, okay. Oh, your friend George came by the office the other"
6,13,129,JERRY,"Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist."
6,13,130,ELAINE,"Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer."
6,13,131,KRAMER,Hey! Jerry!
6,13,132,JERRY,"C'mon, that's not fair!"
6,13,132,KRAMER,I told you I was gonna get it.
6,13,132,JERRY,"No, c'mon Kramer. Gimme that picture."
6,13,132,KRAMER,Aagh. No no no no no.
6,13,132,JERRY,"Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do"
6,13,133,ELAINE,"Uh, Kramer. Kramer, I'd like you to meet my friend Wendy."
6,13,133,KRAMER,"Oh, hello."
6,13,133,WENDY,Hi.
6,13,133,KRAMER,Yeah.
6,13,135,KRAMER,"You know, I really like that hairdo."
6,13,136,WENDY,Oh. Thank you. I actually was thinking it might be
6,13,137,ELAINE,"Oh, you were?"
6,13,137,WENDY,"Well, I..."
6,13,137,KRAMER,"Oh, no no no. You don't wanna do that. No no."
6,13,138,ELAINE,"Kramer, if she wants to change her hair..."
6,13,138,KRAMER,"No, no. you'd be a damn fool to change it. It's very becoming."
6,13,138,WENDY,"Oh, well."
6,13,139,WENDY,"Oh, ho."
6,13,144,WENDY,"So, who's that friend of yours? That guy that came in."
6,13,144,ELAINE,"Oh, Kramer."
6,13,144,WENDY,Yeah. Does he have a girlfriend?
6,13,144,ELAINE,You wanna go out with him?
6,13,144,WENDY,"Well, why not?"
6,13,144,ELAINE,"Well, it's just that... uh, I don't..."
6,13,144,WENDY,"What, is there anything wrong with him?"
6,13,145,WENDY,Elaine?
6,13,145,ELAINE,I'm just thinking about the question.
6,13,148,GEORGE,"You know, my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows"
6,13,149,RECEPTIONIST,She is super. Same time tomorrow.
6,13,149,GEORGE,"Yeah, same time. There"
6,13,152,RECEPTIONIST,"Oh. Ah, you owe a hundred and fifty."
6,13,152,GEORGE,What for?
6,13,152,RECEPTIONIST,"Well, you cancelled on Tuesday, and our policy is"
6,13,153,GEORGE,"Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my"
6,13,155,WENDY,What's the problem?
6,13,155,GEORGE,Are you aware that I'm being charged for Tuesday's
6,13,156,WENDY,"Well, I'm sorry, that's our policy."
6,13,157,GEORGE,"Oh, you have a policy!"
6,13,159,RECEPTIONIST,So. Will you be here tomorrow?
6,13,159,GEORGE,"Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to!"
6,13,165,KRAMER,Hey! So what d'you think? You like it?
6,13,167,JERRY,"Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible..."
6,13,169,JERRY,...You can't put that picture up.
6,13,169,KRAMER,"Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to"
6,13,172,STEVE,Hey Cosmo.
6,13,172,KRAMER,Hey...
6,13,175,KRAMER,"...Steve. Ah, you see?"
6,13,175,ELAINE,"Hey Kramer, my friend Wendy wants to go out with you."
6,13,175,KRAMER,"Well, how do you do?"
6,13,177,MARY,"Hello, Jerry."
6,13,177,JERRY,"Oh. Hello, uh Mary."
6,13,177,MARY,"You know, I've seen you so many times and now we can finally talk"
6,13,178,KRAMER,What was I telling you? Isn't this nice?
6,13,178,JERRY,Yeah.
6,13,178,MARY,"Jerry. You know, could you help me with a package?"
6,13,178,JERRY,"Oh, sure, yeah."
6,13,178,MARY,Thank you.
6,13,180,JERRY,"Oh, no!"
6,13,182,JERRY,You see? That's just what I need. More kissing!
6,13,182,ELAINE,"Hee, hee, hee. Hee hee hee..."
6,13,182,JERRY,What is so funny?
6,13,182,ELAINE,"Nothing, nothing."
6,13,183,JERRY,"Hello. Oh, hi mom. What? Oh my... He didn't?! He"
6,13,185,JERRY,Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!
6,13,185,ELAINE,Why?
6,13,185,JERRY,I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.
6,13,188,JOAN,Hi Jerry. Mmmwah.
6,13,188,JERRY,Hi Joan.
6,13,188,JOAN,How you doing?
6,13,189,JERRY,Pretty good.
6,13,189,JOAN,Just pretty good? Not great?
6,13,189,JERRY,"Okay, great."
6,13,189,JOAN,Are you happy?
6,13,189,JERRY,"Oh, I'm delighted."
6,13,189,JOAN,Okay. Have a nice day.
6,13,189,JERRY,You too.
6,13,191,LOUISE,Hi Jerry.
6,13,192,JERRY,"Hi, Louise."
6,13,196,KRAMER,Hey.
6,13,196,JERRY,"Ah, well. Thank you very much!"
6,13,196,KRAMER,For what?
6,13,196,JERRY,For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like
6,13,198,KRAMER,You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of
6,13,199,JERRY,Family?
6,13,199,KRAMER,Yeah.
6,13,199,JERRY,You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle
6,13,212,RECEPTIONIST,"Oh, hi. Mister Costanza, we were trying to get in touch"
6,13,213,GEORGE,What d'you mean?
6,13,213,RECEPTIONIST,She had some personal affair she had to attend to. I left
6,13,214,GEORGE,When did you leave the message?
6,13,214,RECEPTIONIST,Few hours ago.
6,13,214,GEORGE,"Oh, I'm sorry, I require twenty-four hours notice"
6,13,215,RECEPTIONIST,"Look, Mister Costanza..."
6,13,215,GEORGE,"Will that be cash, or cheque?"
6,13,220,WENDY,I am really glad I took the day off.
6,13,220,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah, there's nothing better than skiing."
6,13,220,WENDY,Yeah. I hope my clients weren't too upset.
6,13,220,ELAINE,"Ugh, the hell with 'em."
6,13,222,ELAINE,What're you stopping here for?
6,13,222,WENDY,I'm dropping you off.
6,13,222,ELAINE,"Oh, no, I'm three more blocks."
6,13,222,WENDY,"Yeah, but if I take you to your door, then I have to go all the"
6,13,224,ELAINE,"Yeah, but it's only three blocks."
6,13,224,WENDY,Right. It's only three blocks.
6,13,224,ELAINE,"Alright, well..."
6,13,231,ELAINE,"She'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and, all of a"
6,13,232,JERRY,"Yes, it's very strange. Very strange."
6,13,232,ELAINE,"I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as"
6,13,233,JERRY,"I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car"
6,13,234,ELAINE,"I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I"
6,13,235,JERRY,You should have her work on it for you.
6,13,235,ELAINE,"Yeah, alright, I gotta go."
6,13,238,MAR,Hi Jerry.
6,13,238,JERRY,Hi Mary.
6,13,240,JERRY,"Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry."
6,13,242,JERRY,...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it.
6,13,245,LOU,Hi Jerry.
6,13,245,JERRY,Hi Louise...
6,13,246,JERRY,
6,13,250,JERRY,Thank you for your cooperation.
6,13,252,JERRY,Hello.
6,13,252,HELEN,Jerry?
6,13,252,JERRY,"Hi mom. So, what's happening with uncle Leo? Is he paying you?"
6,13,254,HELEN,"Well, he said no. He said we had no proof."
6,13,254,MORTY,"No proof? We'll get him. He's a crook, sooner or later, he'll"
6,13,255,HELEN,"Uh, anyway, I want you to go check on Nana at the home."
6,13,255,JERRY,"Okay, I will."
6,13,255,MORTY,"D'you realise, an above-average performing growth mutual fund"
6,13,258,KRAMER,What's up?
6,13,258,JERRY,"Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing"
6,13,259,KRAMER,Oh.
6,13,263,JERRY,"Hey, Kramer, look at this."
6,13,264,JERRY,Look at my picture!
6,13,267,JERRY,I've been defaced!
6,13,267,KRAMER,"Hey, don't you worry buddy. I made double prints."
6,13,269,JACK,Hey. Hi Cosmo.
6,13,269,KRAMER,"Oh, hey, Jack. How you doing?"
6,13,269,JERRY,Hi Jack.
6,13,272,JERRY,"Hey, Julio. I was wondering, could you get to that shower today,"
6,13,273,JULIO,"Oh, I see. When you need something done, you're very friendly to"
6,13,274,JERRY,"No no, that's not true!"
6,13,274,JULIO,"Well, I think it is! It's a big building, Seinfeld,"
6,13,279,NURSE,"Yeah, she's upstairs, playing cards."
6,13,279,JERRY,"You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here,"
6,13,280,NURSE,"Well, she seems very happy. She met an old friend who used to"
6,13,281,JERRY,Buddy?
6,13,281,NURSE,"Yes, that's his name. He's right over there."
6,13,285,WENDY,"I'm sorry, I don't owe you anything. I had some"
6,13,287,GEORGE,"Oh, I see. So your time is more valuable than mine."
6,13,289,WENDY,A delicate genius?
6,13,290,GEORGE,Elaine?
6,13,290,ELAINE,George!
6,13,291,GEORGE,Hah. Good luck.
6,13,291,WENDY,What's going on?
6,13,291,ELAINE,"Wendy, I injured my shoulder, Wednesday, when"
