6,15,0,THE DOORMAN,Written by Tom Gammill & Max Pross
6,15,1,JERRY,"You remember a few years ago in New York, we had the doorman strike? They have a union, in the fancy buildings, and they went out on strike. Now you wouldthink, if any group of people would not wanna demonstrate what life would be like without them, it would be doormen. ""Let's see how they do without us!"" There's no doorman, people open the door, they walk in, it's... you know. Who's gonna walk out next? The guys who clean your windshield at the traffic light, with the dirty rag? ""We demand shorter yellows, and longer reds!"""
6,15,5,DOORMAN,"Whoah, whoah, whoah. May I help you?"
6,15,5,JERRY,"Yeah, I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes."
6,15,5,DOORMAN,Benes? No-one here by that
6,15,6,JERRY,"Oh, she's uh, she's house-sitting for Mr. Pitt."
6,15,6,DOORMAN,"Oh. House-sitting, mmm."
6,15,6,JERRY,Yeah.
6,15,6,DOORMAN,"What're you, the boyfriend? Here for a... quickie?"
6,15,6,JERRY,Can I just go up?
6,15,6,DOORMAN,"Oh, I get it. Why waste time making small talk with the doorman? I"
6,15,12,JERRY,How 'bout those Knicks?
6,15,12,DOORMAN,"Oh, I see. On the sports page..."
6,15,12,JERRY,Yeah.
6,15,12,DOORMAN,"...What makes you think I wasn't reading the Wall Street page? Oh, I"
6,15,17,KRAMER,"So, you think your parents'll get back together?"
6,15,17,GEORGE,I hope so. I can't take him living with me much longer. He makes this
6,15,21,KRAMER,"Hey, George, stick 'em up."
6,15,21,GEORGE,What?
6,15,21,KRAMER,For these German tourists. Pretend that I'm robbing you.
6,15,21,GEORGE,Why?
6,15,21,KRAMER,So these people can go back home and tell their friends they saw a real
6,15,24,KRAMER,"Awright, hands up, porky!"
6,15,27,KRAMER,"That's it. Now, gimme your wallet. Got it in here, huh, fat boy!"
6,15,29,KRAMER,Is that all you got?! Hah? Is that all you got?!
6,15,29,GEORGE,"Alright, that's enough."
6,15,29,KRAMER,"I'll tell you when it's enough! Alright, now you"
6,15,33,ELAINE,"Where've you been? We're gonna miss the movie, let's go."
6,15,34,JERRY,I am not going back down there. I can't face that guy again.
6,15,34,ELAINE,What guy?
6,15,34,JERRY,The doorman. I don't wanna play anymore of his mindgames. What time does
6,15,35,ELAINE,Six. But then the night doorman comes on. He's much scarier. (scary
6,15,36,JERRY,"Well, it's almost six now. Can't we just wait til he goes home?"
6,15,36,JERRY,We'll still make the movie.
6,15,36,ELAINE,"Okay, okay."
6,15,41,GEORGE,"What'd you do today, dad?"
6,15,41,FRANK,"Today, I went record shopping in Greenwich Village. I bought this record,"
6,15,42,GEORGE,I don't have a hi-fi.
6,15,42,FRANK,Didn't I give you my old record player?
6,15,42,GEORGE,I gave it to Cosmo.
6,15,42,FRANK,Cosmo? Who's Cosmo?
6,15,42,KRAMER,I'm Cosmo.
6,15,42,FRANK,"Well, I want it back. I wanna listen to that cha-cha record."
6,15,42,KRAMER,"One-two, cha-cha-cha."
6,15,42,GEORGE,"Alright, alright. Can we go out and eat?"
6,15,42,FRANK,Lemme change my shirt.
6,15,49,ELAINE,"Jerry, it's six. Let's go."
6,15,49,JERRY,"Uh, that doorman's still milling around outside. He's very peculiar."
6,15,50,ELAINE,"No, don't..."
6,15,50,JERRY,"Hello? Oh, hi Mr. Pitt."
6,15,51,ELAINE,Give that to me.
6,15,51,ELAINE,Hello Mr. Pitt. How's Scotland?
6,15,52,MR. PITT,"Elaine, are you having a party?"
6,15,52,ELAINE,"A party. Oh no, that was just my stupid friend Jerry."
6,15,53,JERRY,"Alright, he just left. We can go."
6,15,53,MR. PITT,Because there's to be no entertaining while I'm gone.
6,15,53,ELAINE,"Believe me, we're not entertained. We were just leaving. Oh,"
6,15,55,MR. PITT,I need to know what's in the mail.
6,15,55,ELAINE,"Oh, well, Mr. Pitt, there's really nothing that can't wait. We're trying"
6,15,56,MR. PITT,"Well, you better catch the later show, because I need to"
6,15,57,ELAINE,Alright. I can't go.
6,15,65,ELAINE,"...Uhm, the new Time magazine. The new People..."
6,15,65,MR. PITT,"Oh, who's on the cover?"
6,15,68,DOORMAN,"Hey, buddy."
6,15,68,JERRY,You? Wh...what're you doing here? You work at this building
6,15,69,DOORMAN,"Ah, sure. Poor doorman has to work two jobs to put food on the table"
6,15,70,JERRY,So you work all day as a doorman at one building. Then you come home and
6,15,71,DOORMAN,You got a problem with that?
6,15,71,JERRY,"Look, I'm not going in your building. I really don't have to talk to you."
6,15,73,DOORMAN,"You really think you're better than me, don't"
6,15,78,GEORGE,My father opened his shirt...
6,15,78,JERRY,"Yeah, and?"
6,15,78,GEORGE,"Tell him, Kramer."
6,15,78,KRAMER,He had breasts.
6,15,80,JERRY,"What d'you mean, breasts?"
6,15,80,GEORGE,Big breasts!
6,15,80,JERRY,So what? A lot of older men have that.
6,15,80,KRAMER,"No, not these. These were real hooters."
6,15,81,GEORGE,I was throwing up all night. It was like my own personal Crying Game.
6,15,81,KRAMER,"Well, maybe you're gonna get 'em too, George."
6,15,81,GEORGE,"Yeah, that's right. What if it's a genetic thing, like father"
6,15,82,JERRY,"But, your father's not bald."
6,15,82,GEORGE,"No, no no. That skips a generation. The baldness gene comes from your"
6,15,83,JERRY,Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother.
6,15,85,KRAMER,"You know, Frank can't be too comfortable with those things clanging"
6,15,86,GEORGE,You mean like a bra?
6,15,86,KRAMER,A bra is for ladies. I'm talking about a support undergarment
6,15,87,JERRY,"Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?"
6,15,87,KRAMER,"I tell you, I'm gonna go noodle with this."
6,15,89,BUXOM WOMAN,"Hey, we're twins."
6,15,89,GEORGE,What!!
6,15,89,BUXOM WOMAN,Our shirts. They're the same.
6,15,89,GEORGE,"Oh, Huh, imagine that."
6,15,91,ELAINE,What? What'd you say to the doorman?
6,15,91,JERRY,What? Nothing.
6,15,91,ELAINE,"He claims that you followed him home, and started"
6,15,92,JERRY,What has this guy got a personal vendetta with me?! What'd I do to him?
6,15,93,ELAINE,"Hey, did you make the movie?"
6,15,93,JERRY,No.
6,15,93,ELAINE,You wanna go tonight? You can pick me up.
6,15,93,JERRY,"Alright. Can we go to a later show, so he's off his shift when I come by?"
6,15,93,ELAINE,Ugh. So now we have to rearrange our lives to avoid the doorman?
6,15,93,JERRY,"Yes, we do."
6,15,97,ELAINE,What is wrong with George?
6,15,97,JERRY,He's... trying to get something off his chest.
6,15,99,GEORGE,"Alright, I gotta try and talk my mother into taking him off"
6,15,103,DOORMAN,Help you?
6,15,103,JERRY,Hoh! What're you doing here? You're supposed to be
6,15,104,DOORMAN,I traded shifts with the night doorman. He had some personal affairs to
6,15,106,JERRY,"Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't have"
6,15,108,DOORMAN,You wanna be friends?
6,15,108,JERRY,I'd like to be.
6,15,108,DOORMAN,"Then watch the door for a minute, would you?"
6,15,109,JERRY,What?
6,15,109,DOORMAN,"Yeah, I just wanna run and get a beer. I'll be back in a minute."
6,15,109,JERRY,Wha...? Wai... wait a second. What do I do?
6,15,109,DOORMAN,It's not brain surgery. You open the door for people who live here.
6,15,111,JERRY,Oh.
6,15,117,JERRY,"Hey, hey. Wait a second. Hey! Hello!"
6,15,119,JERRY,"Hey, hey, wait a second. You live here?"
6,15,119,MR. GREEN,Of course I live here. I've lived here for twenty years.
6,15,122,JERRY,You think you're better than me?
6,15,134,DELIVERY GUY,You have to sign for it.
6,15,134,JERRY,"Oh, right."
6,15,136,DELIVERY GUY,"Hey, how 'bout those Knicks, huh?"
6,15,137,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
6,15,143,KRAMER,"Hey. I uh, brought back your record player, huh."
6,15,143,FRANK,"Thank you, Kramer."
6,15,143,KRAMER,Yeah.
6,15,143,FRANK,Put it over there.
6,15,145,KRAMER,"So, how you feeling?"
6,15,145,FRANK,Tired.
6,15,145,KRAMER,Uh huh. Your back hurt?
6,15,145,FRANK,How did you know?
6,15,145,KRAMER,"Well, it's obvious, you know. You're carrying a lot of extra baggage up"
6,15,146,FRANK,Up here?
6,15,146,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah. Top floor. Listen, Frank, have you ever"
6,15,149,FRANK,You want me to wear a bra?!
6,15,149,KRAMER,"No, no. A bra is for ladies."
6,15,150,KRAMER,"Meet, the bro."
6,15,152,ESTELLE,"So, is your father excited about coming home?"
6,15,153,ESTELLE,George?
6,15,153,GEORGE,Hey mom. What kind of woman was grandma?
6,15,153,ESTELLE,All of a sudden you're interested in your grandmother?
6,15,153,GEORGE,"Well, you know. You get to a certain point, you wanna know about your"
6,15,154,ESTELLE,She was a lovely woman.
6,15,154,GEORGE,Yuh. What about physically?
6,15,154,ESTELLE,Physically?
6,15,154,GEORGE,"Yeah, you know, what'd she uh, look like?"
6,15,154,ESTELLE,"Well, you've seen pictures."
6,15,154,GEORGE,You can't tell much from those pictures.
6,15,154,ESTELLE,So what?
6,15,154,GEORGE,"Was she uh, was she a big, uh woman?"
6,15,154,ESTELLE,"Big? No, just my height."
6,15,154,GEORGE,Bosomy?
6,15,154,ESTELLE,Bosomy? You wanna know if your grandmother was bosomy?!
6,15,154,GEORGE,"No, I was just wondering. The information could"
6,15,155,ESTELLE,Where do you get your genes from?!
6,15,155,GEORGE,That's what I'd like to know.
6,15,157,ELAINE,I can't believe you left your post.
6,15,157,JERRY,He left me there. You see the mind games?
6,15,161,ELAINE,"Hey, what's up? What's going on here?"
6,15,161,TENANT 1,Somebody stole the couch out of the lobby.
6,15,162,TENANT 2,Where's the doorman? How come someone wasn't watching the door?
6,15,162,ELAINE,"Jerry, let's get out of here."
6,15,162,JERRY,Yeah.
6,15,168,ESTELLE,"Oh, my god!"
6,15,173,ELAINE,What were you doing watching the door anyway?
6,15,173,JERRY,He asked me to. We were getting along.
6,15,173,ELAINE,"You know, my fingerprints are all over this. That doorman"
6,15,175,JERRY,"Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves, the couch gets stolen?"
6,15,176,ELAINE,"Alright, shut up. Shut up. Just let me think. I gotta"
6,15,177,JERRY,"Alright, well what if we say..."
6,15,177,ELAINE,"Alright, here it is. This is what we'll tell 'em. You came"
6,15,178,JERRY,I came to pick you up.
6,15,178,ELAINE,Yeah. That's what I just said.
6,15,178,JERRY,I know. I was just...
6,15,178,ELAINE,"Yeah, I know what you were just. It's not helping."
6,15,178,JERRY,"Alright, well. Just, start again, then."
6,15,178,ELAINE,"Okay, you came to pick me up at..."
6,15,178,JERRY,Right.
6,15,178,ELAINE,You see? Again.
6,15,178,JERRY,What? I said right.
6,15,179,ELAINE,"Alright, you came right upstairs, without talking to the doorman."
6,15,179,JERRY,But the doorman's gonna say that I was there.
6,15,179,ELAINE,So what? No-one's gonna believe a doorman!
6,15,179,JERRY,But I don't know if this is gonna work.
6,15,179,ELAINE,Just stick with the story. We'll be
6,15,180,JERRY,Okay.
6,15,180,ELAINE,Good. Now fix me a drink.
6,15,182,KRAMER,How's that feel?
6,15,182,FRANK,This feels very comfortable.
6,15,182,KRAMER,You see?
6,15,182,FRANK,I feel ten years younger.
6,15,182,KRAMER,"Yeah, and your posture's a lot better. Look at you."
6,15,183,FRANK,"And I can breathe easier, too."
6,15,183,KRAMER,"I told you! Now, Frank, listen. Here's what I'm thinking. Now, you have"
6,15,184,FRANK,Of course. Sid Farkus. He's the best in the business.
6,15,184,KRAMER,"Here's our chance. What d'you say? It'll be me, you"
6,15,185,FRANK,Let's do it!
6,15,186,FRANK,"Except, we gotta do something about the name."
6,15,186,KRAMER,"Why, what's wrong with bro?"
6,15,186,FRANK,"No, bro's no good. Too ethnic."
6,15,186,KRAMER,"Alright, you got something better?"
6,15,186,FRANK,How 'bout uh... the mansiere?
6,15,186,KRAMER,Mansiere?
6,15,186,FRANK,"That's right. A brassiere for a man. The mansiere, get it?"
6,15,187,GEORGE,"Well, you've scared her off. We may never see mom again."
6,15,187,FRANK,"Hey George, what d'you like better? The bro, or the mansiere?"
6,15,188,GEORGE,Dad. We need to talk.
6,15,190,DOORMAN,"I had to use the bathroom, so I asked this guy to watch the door for a"
6,15,192,MRS. PAYTON,Why should I believe you?
6,15,192,DOORMAN,"Actually, it was her friend."
6,15,194,MRS. PAYTON,"I was just speaking to the doorman here, about the couch robbery."
6,15,195,ELAINE,"Oh really? The doorman. And, pray tell, what did the doorman"
6,15,196,MRS. PAYTON,He said he asked a friend of yours to watch the door.
6,15,196,ELAINE,"Oh, my. Well, the doorman certainly has a wild imagination,"
6,15,199,DOORMAN,Well... what do we have here? Perhaps Miss Benes could explain why a
6,15,203,ELAINE,"He never watched a door before, Mrs Payton, he didn't know"
6,15,206,ELAINE,Don't you see what's going on here? He set us up. He's
6,15,211,JERRY,You're saying I'm responsible for the couch?
6,15,211,ELAINE,There was nothing I could do. He said he had a Federal
6,15,212,JERRY,Diabolical. He thought of everything. He was setting me up from
6,15,213,ELAINE,Is it possible we were victims of a sting?
6,15,213,JERRY,I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies.
6,15,217,DOORMAN 2,"So, you didn't even watch the couch?"
6,15,217,DOORMAN,No. I was just messing with his head.
6,15,217,DOORMAN 2,And they think they're better than us?
6,15,220,ELAINE,"Anyway, Jerry... Jerry?"
6,15,221,ELAINE,We have to replace the couch.
6,15,221,JERRY,Now we have to buy a new couch?!
6,15,222,GEORGE,Not necessarily. Why don't you take back the couch you gave me?
6,15,222,JERRY,The one with the Poppie stain?!
6,15,222,GEORGE,"Yeah, sure. Then my father will have no place to sleep."
6,15,223,ELAINE,But it's got a pee-stain on it.
6,15,223,GEORGE,"No, the cushion's turned over."
6,15,223,ELAINE,I guess.
6,15,223,GEORGE,Yeah. You get a couch. I get rid of my father. It
6,15,227,KRAMER,"Now, it's called the bro."
6,15,227,FRANK,"Or, the mansiere."
6,15,227,KRAMER,"Yeah, but I prefer the bro."
6,15,227,FRANK,I like mansiere.
6,15,228,FARKUS,"Well, I have to tell you, it's a very interesting idea."
6,15,228,KRAMER,Yeah.
6,15,228,FARKUS,"You know, selling bras exclusively to women, we're really only utilising"
6,15,229,FRANK,"That's what we figured, huh?"
6,15,229,KRAMER,I told you.
6,15,229,FARKUS,"And, to be perfectly frank, I've always felt I could use some support. I"
6,15,230,FRANK,I wouldn't be caught dead in Banlon.
6,15,231,FARKUS,"So uh, what d'you see in the back? Hooks? Velcro?"
6,15,232,KRAMER,Uh.
6,15,232,FRANK,Definitely velcro.
6,15,233,KRAMER,"Say you're getting intimate with a woman uh, you don't want her fumbling"
6,15,235,KRAMER,I think we've all experienced that.
6,15,236,FARKUS,Summer nights.
6,15,237,KRAMER,Very funny.
6,15,237,FARKUS,"Well, I still have to talk about this to Mr. Degrunmont..."
6,15,237,KRAMER,"Of course, yes."
6,15,237,FARKUS,"...But, barring any unforeseen developments, gentlemen, I think we're"
6,15,240,FARKUS,"Frank, I wanna tell you how sorry I am to hear about you and"
6,15,242,FRANK,"Oh, thank you, Sid, but that's all in the past. I'm ready to move on."
6,15,242,FARKUS,I've always been very fond of Estelle. Beautiful woman. I
6,15,244,FRANK,You wanna go out with my wife?! Where do you get the nerve
6,15,245,FARKUS,"Oh, no, Frank, I was just saying..."
6,15,246,FRANK,"I know what you're saying, and I know what you're thinking!!"
6,15,246,FARKUS,"No, Frank..."
6,15,246,FRANK,"C'mon, Cosmo, I'm not doing business with this guy."
6,15,248,KRAMER,Frank!
6,15,250,GEORGE,Jerry took the couch back.
6,15,250,FRANK,He took it back? Didn't you tell him I was using it?
6,15,250,GEORGE,"Oh, I pleaded with him."
6,15,250,FRANK,Where am I supposed to sleep?
6,15,250,GEORGE,"Well, I took the liberty of packing your things. Mom's coming"
6,15,251,KRAMER,"I thought Jerry didn't want that couch, because of the stain?"
6,15,252,FRANK,What stain?
6,15,252,KRAMER,"Oh, you didn't notice? It has a pee-stain."
6,15,253,FRANK,You had me sleeping on a pee-stained couch?
6,15,253,GEORGE,"No. No, no, no. The cushion was turned over."
6,15,253,FRANK,"But, the very idea. you had me lying in urine!!"
6,15,254,GEORGE,"Ah! There's mom, there's mom."
6,15,255,ESTELLE,Is it safe to come in?
6,15,255,GEORGE,"Oh, of course. Of course."
6,15,255,ESTELLE,You're not having any of your transvestite parties?
6,15,255,FRANK,Will you stop it?
6,15,255,ESTELLE,"I lived with him for forty years, I never saw him trying on"
6,15,257,FRANK,"Here, Cosmo..."
6,15,257,KRAMER,"Oh, hey."
6,15,257,FRANK,...You can have the hi-fi. I don't need it now...
6,15,257,KRAMER,"Awright, I got it."
6,15,257,FRANK,
6,15,258,ESTELLE,"Alright, let's go."
6,15,259,FRANK,We'll go out for dinner tonight.
6,15,259,ESTELLE,"I can't tonight, I'm busy."
6,15,259,FRANK,"What d'you mean, busy?"
6,15,259,ESTELLE,I'm having dinner with someone.
6,15,259,FRANK,With whom?
6,15,260,ESTELLE,Sid Farkus.
6,15,260,FRANK,Sid Farkus?! You're not having dinner with a bra salesman.
6,15,262,ESTELLE,"Hey, he only sells them. He doesn't wear 'em."
6,15,262,FRANK,"Okay, that's it! I'm not coming home!"
6,15,263,GEORGE,But you can't stay here. There's no place to sleep!
6,15,263,FRANK,We'll work something out.
6,15,269,GERMAN WOMAN,"Stop him! Ja, ja, ja, it's him!"
6,15,272,GERMAN WOMAN,Stop that man! It's him.
6,15,274,GERMAN WOMAN,"Somebody, stop him! Please, quick. Stop, it's him. I know, I know."
6,15,277,HORST,"Hey, hey. That record player is not yours."
6,15,277,KRAMER,"Now, look. Somebody gave it to me."
6,15,277,HORST,You're a thief. We have proof.
6,15,278,HORST,What is that?
6,15,280,KRAMER,"The first upper-body support undergarment, specifically designed for"
