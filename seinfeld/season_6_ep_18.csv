6,18,0,THE FUSILLI JERRY,Written by Marjorie Gross
6,18,1,JERRY,I hear you're going out with David Putty.
6,18,1,ELAINE,"Yeah. What, is it a problem?"
6,18,1,JERRY,"Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine."
6,18,1,ELAINE,"Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years."
6,18,1,JERRY,"Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible."
6,18,1,ELAINE,"Oh, god."
6,18,1,JERRY,"The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic."
6,18,1,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is."
6,18,1,JERRY,All right.
6,18,2,GEORGE,"Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day."
6,18,2,ESTELLE,So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish connoisseur.
6,18,2,GEORGE,"You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture."
6,18,2,ESTELLE,"So, I'm getting an eye job."
6,18,2,GEORGE,"An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job."
6,18,2,ESTELLE,"Georgie, I'm a divorcee."
6,18,2,GEORGE,"No, you're not a divorcee. You're just separated. You're---you're a separatee."
6,18,2,ESTELLE,"Well, I'm out there, George."
6,18,2,GEORGE,"No, you're not out there."
6,18,2,ESTELLE,"I am, too!"
6,18,2,GEORGE,"You're not out there! You can't be, because *I* am out there. And if I see *you* out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence!"
6,18,2,ESTELLE,"Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up."
6,18,2,GEORGE,Tuesday? I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run---
6,18,2,ESTELLE,This is the only time the doctor *has*.
6,18,3,GEORGE,"Kramer, hey, hey!"
6,18,3,KRAMER,"Hi, little buddy."
6,18,3,GEORGE,Come on over and sit down.
6,18,3,KRAMER,"Hey, listen, I gotta go somewhere."
6,18,3,GEORGE,"No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun..."
6,18,3,KRAMER,"All right, I'm sitting down. How are you? (Kisses Estelle on the"
6,18,4,ESTELLE,"So, Kramer. I'm getting an eye job."
6,18,4,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah, good for you. Hey, you have to look your best. You're"
6,18,6,GEORGE,She's not out there!
6,18,6,KRAMER,"So, who is your doctor?"
6,18,6,ESTELLE,"Uh, Bakersoll."
6,18,6,KRAMER,. He's good. He's *very* good. He worked on this kid
6,18,7,GEORGE,"Hey, Kramer, what are you doing Tuesday?"
6,18,7,KRAMER,Tuesday? Uh...
6,18,7,GEORGE,Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's got the car
6,18,8,ESTELLE,"Oh, I don't care."
6,18,8,KRAMER,"Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to"
6,18,9,GEORGE,"Well, giddy-up!"
6,18,10,KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo"
6,18,11,CLERK,Kramer.... All right...
6,18,11,KRAMER,All righty...
6,18,11,CLERK,"Sign right here, please."
6,18,11,KRAMER,Okay. . Thanks.
6,18,13,CLERK,What's your name again?
6,18,13,KRAMER,Cosmo Kramer.
6,18,13,CLERK,Cosmo Kramer. You *are* the Assman.
6,18,13,KRAMER,No! I'm not the Assman.
6,18,13,CLERK,"Well, as far as the state of New York is concerned, you are."
6,18,18,DAVID,How do you feel?
6,18,18,ELAINE,Fine.
6,18,18,DAVID,Something the matter?
6,18,18,ELAINE,No.
6,18,18,DAVID,Then what is it?
6,18,18,ELAINE,"No, nothing."
6,18,20,JERRY,Hi.
6,18,20,ELAINE,I was with David *Putty* last night.
6,18,20,JERRY,"Yeah, so."
6,18,20,ELAINE,He did the move.
6,18,20,JERRY,What move?
6,18,20,ELAINE,You know...*the* move.
6,18,20,JERRY,Wait a second. *My* move?
6,18,21,JERRY,David Putty used *my* move?
6,18,21,ELAINE,"Yes, yes."
6,18,21,JERRY,Are you sure?
6,18,21,ELAINE,Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move.
6,18,21,JERRY,I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.
6,18,21,ELAINE,What else did you tell him. (does it
6,18,22,JERRY,"Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we"
6,18,24,ELAINE,Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?
6,18,24,JERRY,"Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it."
6,18,24,ELAINE,"Well, wait---wait a second."
6,18,24,JERRY,What?
6,18,24,ELAINE,Isn't that a little...rash?
6,18,24,JERRY,No! He stole my move!
6,18,24,ELAINE,"Yeah, but...*I* like the move."
6,18,24,JERRY,"Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material."
6,18,24,ELAINE,"Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a"
6,18,25,JERRY,"Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new."
6,18,27,ELAINE,"You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic."
6,18,27,JERRY,"I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York."
6,18,29,JERRY,...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.
6,18,29,GEORGE,You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? I *need* a
6,18,31,JERRY,Can I just get it opened first?
6,18,31,GEORGE,I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing
6,18,32,JERRY,"All right, all right. Here. (hands George a piece of the candy"
6,18,33,GEORGE,"Oh, that's good. That's very good."
6,18,33,JERRY,You feel better?
6,18,33,GEORGE,"Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need"
6,18,35,JERRY,Nancy Klopper?
6,18,35,GEORGE,Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here.
6,18,37,JERRY,"All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure,"
6,18,38,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault."
6,18,38,JERRY,It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like
6,18,40,GEORGE,You're gonna tell me...or not.
6,18,40,JERRY,All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a
6,18,41,GEORGE,I got a headboard.
6,18,41,JERRY,Is it padded?
6,18,41,GEORGE,No.
6,18,41,JERRY,Good. How tall is she?
6,18,41,GEORGE,Five-foot four. Why?
6,18,41,JERRY,You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights.
6,18,42,GEORGE,I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.
6,18,42,JERRY,"George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again."
6,18,44,JERRY,"Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the"
6,18,46,GEORGE,Is it a clockwise swirl?
6,18,46,JERRY,"I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone."
6,18,47,KRAMER,"Here you go, buddy. ."
6,18,47,JERRY,What is it?
6,18,47,KRAMER,*Fusilli* Jerry! It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the microphone?
6,18,47,JERRY,When did you do this?
6,18,47,KRAMER,"In my spare time. . You know, I'm working on one"
6,18,49,JERRY,Oh... Why Fusilli?
6,18,49,KRAMER,Because *you're* silly. Get it?
6,18,50,JERRY,"Well, thank you very much."
6,18,50,GEORGE,"So, did you get your new plates?"
6,18,50,KRAMER,Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. Somebody
6,18,51,GEORGE,What do they say?
6,18,51,KRAMER,Assman.
6,18,51,JERRY,Assman?
6,18,51,KRAMER,"Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman!"
6,18,51,JERRY,"Who would order a license plate that says ""Assman""?"
6,18,51,GEORGE,Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's.
6,18,51,JERRY,It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be
6,18,52,KRAMER,"Yeah, or it could be a proctologist."
6,18,52,JERRY,Yeah. Proctologist.
6,18,52,GEORGE,Come on! No doctor would put that on his car.
6,18,52,KRAMER,"Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very"
6,18,56,THE SAME WAY,"""It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one."""
6,18,57,KRAMER,Oh! There's my phone.
6,18,57,GEORGE,"So, where you gonna stick this"
6,18,57,JERRY,I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.
6,18,58,JERRY,"Hey, David."
6,18,58,DAVID,"Oh, hi, Jerry."
6,18,58,JERRY,"Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move."
6,18,58,DAVID,What move?
6,18,58,JERRY,What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on
6,18,59,DAVID,"You're move? What, are you kidding? I was doing that before I knew"
6,18,60,JERRY,"The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing."
6,18,61,DAVID,"Oh, that ending was *so* obvious. I would have figured it out"
6,18,62,JERRY,Swirl.
6,18,62,DAVID,Whatever. I don't even do it.
6,18,62,JERRY,"Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*."
6,18,62,DAVID,"Yeah, that's right."
6,18,62,JERRY,"You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples?"
6,18,63,DAVID,"Are you through, 'cuz, uh, I gotta get back to work."
6,18,63,JERRY,"Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out"
6,18,64,DAVID,"All right, how about the next time your car breaks down, you take"
6,18,65,JERRY,Fine.
6,18,65,DAVID,Good!
6,18,68,NANCY,"Ow, George! What are you"
6,18,69,GEORGE,Uh...you
6,18,70,NANCY,"Well, stop it!"
6,18,70,GEORGE,You don't like the move?
6,18,70,NANCY,No. I don't.
6,18,70,GEORGE,You're kidding.
6,18,70,NANCY,"No, I'm not. It feels like aliens poking at my body."
6,18,70,GEORGE,Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine.
6,18,71,ELAINE,"Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes!"
6,18,71,DAVID,"No, I'm sorry."
6,18,71,ELAINE,What?!!
6,18,71,DAVID,I can't do the move.
6,18,71,ELAINE,What?
6,18,71,DAVID,"Oh, he's ruined it for me."
6,18,71,ELAINE,"Oh, oh, come on, please?"
6,18,71,DAVID,"No, he called me a hack. I'm just not into doing it anymore."
6,18,71,ELAINE,"Oh, so---so that's it?"
6,18,71,DAVID,I'll come up with some new stuff.
6,18,73,KRAMER,"""Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think I have what"
6,18,75,DR. BAKERSOLL,I must caution you about one thing. You can't cry for at
6,18,76,ESTELLE,"Oh, okay."
6,18,76,DR. BAKERSOLL,"Now, is someone coming to pick you up?"
6,18,76,ESTELLE,"Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute."
6,18,78,SECURITY GUARD,Can I help you?
6,18,78,KRAMER,"Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer. Proctology."
6,18,78,SECURITY GUARD,"Oh, oh, okay. Sure..."
6,18,78,KRAMER,Thanks. Have a good day.
6,18,79,KRAMER,I just can't get over how fantastic you look.
6,18,79,ESTELLE,"Oh, really?"
6,18,79,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah. This takes twenty years off."
6,18,79,ESTELLE,And it was all done by laser. I don't even need bandages.
6,18,81,ESTELLE,"Did he say ""Assman""?"
6,18,81,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah."
6,18,81,ESTELLE,Oh my goodness.
6,18,82,KRAMER,You got that straight!
6,18,82,ESTELLE,Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference.
6,18,85,JERRY,You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the
6,18,86,GEORGE,Supposed to close with the swirl?
6,18,86,JERRY,"Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression"
6,18,87,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, should've written it down."
6,18,88,JERRY,Yeah?
6,18,88,BUZZER,Elaine.
6,18,88,JERRY,C'mon up. You know what? Do me a favor. Don't
6,18,90,JERRY,"Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred"
6,18,92,GEORGE,"What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it"
6,18,93,JERRY,Except that it's not Putty.
6,18,93,GEORGE,What happened to Putty?
6,18,93,JERRY,"Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other"
6,18,94,GEORGE,"Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think?"
6,18,98,JERRY,"Hey, Elaine."
6,18,98,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, hello."
6,18,98,JERRY,Is it something I said?
6,18,98,ELAINE,Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move anymore.
6,18,98,JERRY,Really?
6,18,98,ELAINE,"Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this thing."
6,18,98,JERRY,What is it?
6,18,98,ELAINE,"Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's"
6,18,99,JERRY,Huh.
6,18,99,ELAINE,"I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of"
6,18,101,GEORGE,Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle
6,18,102,ELAINE,"Yes. As a matter of fact, there is."
6,18,102,GEORGE,I think that's mine.
6,18,102,ELAINE,I'm not surprised.
6,18,102,JERRY,Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're
6,18,103,ELAINE,Why?
6,18,103,JERRY,You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is
6,18,104,ELAINE,An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?
6,18,104,JERRY,"Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just"
6,18,106,ELAINE,(takes the work order and points to the Fusilli Jerry sitting on the
6,18,107,JERRY,"That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry."
6,18,107,ELAINE,Fusilli Jerry?
6,18,107,JERRY,Yeah. Kramer made it.
6,18,107,GEORGE,"All right, listen, I'll see you guys later."
6,18,108,JERRY,"Hey, Assman!"
6,18,108,KRAMER,"Hey, well, this is Sally."
6,18,108,SALLY,Hello.
6,18,108,JERRY,Hi.
6,18,108,ELAINE,Hi.
6,18,108,KRAMER,Shall we go?
6,18,108,SALLY,Okay. (turns around and walks out with an exaggerated swing of her
6,18,111,ESTELLE,You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself.
6,18,111,FRANK,You're not the only one improving yourself. I worked out with a
6,18,112,ESTELLE,Just take your mail and go home. I have things to do.
6,18,112,FRANK,"I got things to do, too."
6,18,112,ESTELLE,Don't upset me! I can't cry!
6,18,112,FRANK,"Getting an eye job like some Manhattanite, huh?"
6,18,112,ESTELLE,"Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me."
6,18,112,FRANK,Kramer made a pass at you? You're crazy.
6,18,112,ESTELLE,I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab.
6,18,112,FRANK,He stopped short? That's my move. I'm gonna kill him!
6,18,114,ELAINE,"Hey, let me ask you a question."
6,18,114,DAVID,Sure.
6,18,114,ELAINE,What do you charge for blown shocks?
6,18,114,DAVID,What?
6,18,114,ELAINE,"Two, three hundred?"
6,18,114,DAVID,I don't know. Maybe five hundred.
6,18,114,ELAINE,Ah.
6,18,115,ELAINE,What about a bad gasket?
6,18,115,DAVID,Bad gasket?
6,18,115,ELAINE,Yeah. Like a terrible gasket.
6,18,115,DAVID,What is all this?
6,18,115,ELAINE,"Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do."
6,18,115,DAVID,What kind of car is it?
6,18,115,ELAINE,Oh...any kind of---of a Swedish car.
6,18,115,DAVID,"All together, that could run about sixteen hundred."
6,18,115,ELAINE,Oh.
6,18,116,ELAINE,Is that with the parts and labor?
6,18,116,DAVID,Uh-huh.
6,18,116,ELAINE,Hmm.
6,18,117,ELAINE,"Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle...."
6,18,120,NANCY,Wow. That was...*great*. I mean...*wow*.
6,18,120,GEORGE,It just came to me.
6,18,120,NANCY,I---I've never in my life have---have I---. What was that?
6,18,120,GEORGE,You mean in the end?
6,18,120,NANCY,Uh-huh.
6,18,120,GEORGE,A counter-clockwise swirl.
6,18,121,NANCY,What's that?
6,18,121,GEORGE,What?
6,18,121,NANCY,On---on your hand? Let me see what's on your hand.
6,18,121,GEORGE,Nothing. I don't know...just a little dirt.
6,18,121,NANCY,Give me that. I wanna see what's on your hand.
6,18,123,NANCY,"Number one. Take her leg.... Oh, my god! Crib notes? You've got"
6,18,124,GEORGE,It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.
6,18,124,NANCY,"Oh, my god, you're sick."
6,18,124,GEORGE,"You know, it's not the S.A.T.s!"
6,18,127,FRANK,"Assman? I'll get him, Assman!"
6,18,128,JERRY,"Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping me"
6,18,129,ELAINE,So what are you going to do?
6,18,129,JERRY,"Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this."
6,18,129,ELAINE,Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore?
6,18,129,JERRY,Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know
6,18,131,JERRY,"Hi, Mr. Constanza. What's uh...?"
6,18,131,FRANK,Where's your friend Kramer?
6,18,131,JERRY,I don't know. Why?
6,18,131,FRANK,Because I'm looking for him. That's why. He stopped short.
6,18,131,JERRY,What do you mean?
6,18,131,FRANK,"In a car, with my wife. He stopped short. You think I don't know"
6,18,134,JERRY,"Really, stopping short. That's a good move."
6,18,134,FRANK,You're not kidding it's a good move!
6,18,135,KRAMER,Hey.
6,18,135,JERRY,Hey.
6,18,135,KRAMER,"Hey, Frank."
6,18,135,FRANK,Don't Frank me! I know what you did. How dare you stop short with
6,18,136,KRAMER,"C'mon, Frank, relax. I don't even know what you're talking about."
6,18,137,FRANK,"You think I don't know, Assman?!! To think I almost split the"
6,18,138,KRAMER,Bro.
6,18,138,FRANK,Manssierre!
6,18,138,KRAMER,Bro!
6,18,138,FRANK,Manssierre! You...!
6,18,140,FRANK,Aah!!!
6,18,140,JERRY,"Oh, my god!"
6,18,145,JERRY,"If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it."
6,18,145,ELAINE,Me either.
6,18,145,GEORGE,They say this guy's the best.
6,18,145,JERRY,He had to use cork-screw pasta.
6,18,148,KRAMER,"Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this."
6,18,149,KRAMER,The name on the boat. Look at it.
6,18,149,JERRY,Assman!
6,18,149,KRAMER,"Yeah , he's the Assman! Jerry,"
6,18,151,DOCTOR,Which one is the son?
6,18,151,GEORGE,I am.
6,18,151,DOCTOR,Ah. I'm Doctor Cooperman. I just want you to know that this won't
6,18,153,KRAMER,"Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently get the"
6,18,154,DR. COOPERMAN,Yes. I'm still waiting for the motor vehicle bureau to
6,18,155,KRAMER,So...you're the Assman.
