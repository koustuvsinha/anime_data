6,21,0,THE FACE PAINTER,Written by Larry David
6,21,1,JERRY,"Monkeys are really the end of the line in the pet world. I think when you're at the monkey level of pet ownership, have a kid. I mean, come on, you know, I mean, you're *so* close. If you need a pet that can roller skate and smoke cigars, it's time to think about a family. Monkeys, of course, were the first astronauts in the sixties, which I'm sure made perfect sense in the monkey brain. 'Maybe that is the next logical step for me, because I've been working with the Italian guy and the crank organ, and I think I'm ready to handle the maximum re-entry g-forces."
6,21,2,GEORGE,"Take toilet paper for example. Do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime? It's just paper on a cardboard roll, that's it. And in ten thousand years, it will still be exactly the same because really, what else can they do?"
6,21,2,SIENA,That's true. There really has been no development in toilet paper.
6,21,2,GEORGE,"And everything else has changed. But toilet paper is exactly the same, and will be so until we're dead."
6,21,2,SIENA,"Yeah, you're right George. What else can they do?"
6,21,2,GEORGE,"It's just paper on a roll, that's it. And that's all it will ever be."
6,21,2,SIENA,Wow.
6,21,2,GEORGE,"You find this interesting, don't you?"
6,21,2,SIENA,"Yes. yes, I do."
6,21,4,ELAINE,"Oh, thanks very much, the soup was really good."
6,21,4,JERRY,What are you telling him for?
6,21,4,ELAINE,What?
6,21,4,JERRY,"He's the busboy, you think he cares about the soup?"
6,21,4,ELAINE,"Yeah, why? Wouldn't he want the soup to be good?"
6,21,4,JERRY,"Elaine, it's all this guy can do to keep from killing himself. You think he's back there, talking to the chef, going, ""Hey, they like the soup!Keep it up!""?"
6,21,4,ELAINE,"Hey, isn't that Alec Berg?"
6,21,4,JERRY,"Yep, Alec Berg. He's got a good 'John Houseman' name. Alec Beeerg. Mr. Beeerg."
6,21,4,ELAINE,"I can't stand him, he is so pretentious."
6,21,4,JERRY,John Houseman?
6,21,4,ELAINE,"No, Alec Berg."
6,21,4,ALEC,Elaine!
6,21,4,ELAINE,Hi!
6,21,4,ALEC,"Hi, how are you? Jerry."
6,21,4,JERRY,"Hi, Alec."
6,21,4,ALEC,Did you hear about Gary Fogel?
6,21,4,JERRY,Yeah.
6,21,4,ALEC,You gonna go to the funeral on Friday?
6,21,4,JERRY,"Yeah, hey did I see you on TV at the Ranger game? Were those your seats"
6,21,5,ALEC,"Those are them, yeah. Season tickets. Uh, you know, unfortunately I"
6,21,6,JERRY,"Oh, I'd love to, are you sure?"
6,21,6,ALEC,"Absolutely, you just call my secretary, she'll arrange everything."
6,21,6,JERRY,Gee thanks! Thanks a lot!
6,21,6,ALEC,"It's my pleasure. Be good. You know,"
6,21,7,JERRY,"Alright, thanks again."
6,21,7,ELAINE,Thank you very much.
6,21,7,JERRY,"Really, thank you."
6,21,8,JERRY,Well what about these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read?
6,21,9,ELAINE,Who?
6,21,9,JERRY,These are the people that want to talk to you. They got nothing else to
6,21,10,ELAINE,I will never understand people.
6,21,10,JERRY,They're the worst.
6,21,11,GEORGE,"Something's up, there's something in the air."
6,21,11,JERRY,"Well, what is with you?"
6,21,11,GEORGE,"Well, I think this is it."
6,21,11,ELAINE,What's it?
6,21,11,GEORGE,I saw Siena again.
6,21,11,ELAINE,Siena?
6,21,11,JERRY,"Yeah, he's dating a crayon."
6,21,11,GEORGE,We discussed toilet paper.
6,21,11,JERRY,Toilet paper?
6,21,11,GEORGE,"Yeah, I told her how toilet paper hasn't changed in my lifetime, and"
6,21,13,JERRY,What are you talking about?
6,21,13,ELAINE,Yeah.
6,21,13,JERRY,Toilet paper's changed.
6,21,13,ELAINE,Yeah.
6,21,13,JERRY,It's softer.
6,21,13,ELAINE,Softer.
6,21,13,JERRY,More sheets per roll
6,21,13,ELAINE,Sheets.
6,21,13,JERRY,Comes in a wide variety of colors.
6,21,13,ELAINE,Colors.
6,21,13,GEORGE,"Ok, ok, fine! It's changed, it's not really the point. Anyway, I'm"
6,21,14,JERRY,What?
6,21,14,GEORGE,"I might tell her that I love her. I came this close last night, then I"
6,21,15,JERRY,"Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy. Are you confident in the 'I love"
6,21,16,GEORGE,Fifty-fifty.
6,21,16,JERRY,"Cause if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoh ball"
6,21,17,GEORGE,"Aw, I've just got to say it once, everybody else gets to say it, why"
6,21,18,ELAINE,"What, you never said it?"
6,21,18,GEORGE,"Once, to a dog. He licked himself and left the room."
6,21,18,JERRY,"Well, so it wasn't a total loss."
6,21,19,KRAMER,Hey.
6,21,19,JERRY,"Hey, I forgot to tell you! I got tickets to the Rangers-Devils playoff"
6,21,20,KRAMER,"Oh, I'm there, Monongahela!"
6,21,20,JERRY,"What about you, George?"
6,21,20,GEORGE,"Eh eh eh, can't do it, can't do it, sorry, I got a date."
6,21,20,KRAMER,"So, so."
6,21,20,GEORGE,"Oh no no no, if you must know, I would rather be with her than go to"
6,21,21,KRAMER,"She must be a very special lady, huh George, yeah."
6,21,21,JERRY,"Well, what do I do with the extra ticket?"
6,21,21,ELAINE,"Oh hey, can I bring David Puddy? He's a big Devils' fan."
6,21,21,JERRY,"Sure, fine with me."
6,21,21,GEORGE,"Hey, by the way, if anybody wants an inside tour of the zoo, Siena"
6,21,22,KRAMER,So she works at the zoo?
6,21,22,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah."
6,21,22,KRAMER,"Yeah, like Diane Fosse. You know she's the only person that's ever"
6,21,25,ELAINE,So how long have you been a Devils' fan?
6,21,25,PUDDY,"Since I was a kid, I'm from Jersey."
6,21,25,ELAINE,"Yeah? Well, we're gonna kick your butts tonight."
6,21,25,PUDDY,"Hey, no way, man."
6,21,25,ELAINE,Yes.
6,21,25,PUDDY,We're primed.
6,21,25,ELAINE,"Alright, you almost ready? Cause Jerry and Kramer are gonna be here"
6,21,27,ELAINE,What the--
6,21,27,PUDDY,So what do you think?
6,21,27,ELAINE,What is that?
6,21,27,PUDDY,I painted my face.
6,21,27,ELAINE,You painted your face?
6,21,27,PUDDY,Yeah.
6,21,27,ELAINE,Why?
6,21,27,PUDDY,"You know, support the team."
6,21,27,ELAINE,"Well, you can't walk around like that."
6,21,27,PUDDY,Why not?
6,21,27,ELAINE,Because it's insane?
6,21,27,PUDDY,"Hey, you gotta let them know you're out there, this is the playoffs."
6,21,30,KRAMER,Hey.
6,21,30,PUDDY,Hey.
6,21,30,ELAINE,"Dave, um, painted his face."
6,21,30,KRAMER,"Yeah, that's cool. Well, you gotta support your team."
6,21,30,PUDDY,"Ok, ready to go?"
6,21,30,KRAMER,Yeah.
6,21,30,PUDDY,
6,21,33,PUDDY,"You're dead, Messier! We're gonna get you, Messier!"
6,21,33,FAN #1,Will you sit down?
6,21,33,PUDDY,"Hey man, I'm just trying to support the team."
6,21,33,ELAINE,Will you sit down? You're disturbing everybody. Sit down!
6,21,33,PUDDY,"Oh yeah, because you're a Ranger fan and you know I'm messing with their"
6,21,35,PUDDY,Go Devils!!
6,21,37,RADIO ANNOUNCER,Devils goal! Stephan Richer scores from just inside the blue
6,21,38,GEORGE,"You know, I could have actually gone to that."
6,21,38,SIENA,So why didn't you?
6,21,38,GEORGE,"Well, I didn't want to break our date."
6,21,38,SIENA,"Oh, well."
6,21,38,GEORGE,Because I... I love you.
6,21,38,SIENA,"You know, I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat."
6,21,40,PUDDY,Ha ha! We took it to you! You couldn't get it out of your zone all
6,21,41,KRAMER,"Alright, that's enough out of you, there's still three more games left"
6,21,46,PUDDY,"Hey, what are you doing?! Watch where you're"
6,21,50,FATHER HERNANDEZ,El Diablo! Dios mio! El Diablo!!
6,21,51,JERRY,"""I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat."""
6,21,51,GEORGE,Yup.
6,21,51,JERRY,Big matzoh ball.
6,21,51,GEORGE,Huge matzoh ball.
6,21,51,JERRY,Those damn 'I love you' returns.
6,21,51,GEORGE,"Well, it's all over. I slipped up."
6,21,51,JERRY,"Oh, you don't know."
6,21,51,GEORGE,You have any idea how fast these things deteriorate when there's an 'I
6,21,53,JERRY,Unless you're married.
6,21,53,GEORGE,"I mean, now she thinks that I'm one of these guys that love her."
6,21,54,JERRY,"No, people hate that."
6,21,54,GEORGE,You want to be with somebody that doesn't like you.
6,21,54,JERRY,Ideally.
6,21,54,GEORGE,I am never saying 'I love you' again unless they say it first.
6,21,54,WAITRESS,Matzoh ball soup?
6,21,54,GEORGE,That'd be me.
6,21,56,KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry? You're a smart guy, right?"
6,21,56,JERRY,No question about it.
6,21,56,KRAMER,"Alright, you know I'm supposed to go on this special tour today with"
6,21,57,JERRY,At the zoo?
6,21,57,KRAMER,"Yeah, but before I met up with her, I stopped to look at the monkeys,"
6,21,61,JERRY,"Kramer, you threw a banana peel at a monkey?"
6,21,61,KRAMER,"Well, he started it!"
6,21,61,JERRY,"It's a monkey, Kramer!"
6,21,61,KRAMER,"Well, he pushed my buttons, I couldn't help it, Jerry."
6,21,61,JERRY,"Well, I still think it's wrong."
6,21,61,KRAMER,"Alright, alright, fine. You take the monkey's side, alright, go ahead."
6,21,61,JERRY,I'm not taking anyone's side.
6,21,61,KRAMER,"Cause I know what happened, Jerry. (remembering something"
6,21,63,JERRY,No.
6,21,63,KRAMER,"Oh, Jerry, what are you waiting for?"
6,21,63,JERRY,What do I gotta call him for? I thanked him five times when he gave
6,21,64,KRAMER,"Oh, no no no, you gotta call him the next day, it's common courtesy."
6,21,64,JERRY,"No, I don't believe in it. I'm taking a stand against all this over"
6,21,65,KRAMER,"Jerry, good manners are the glue of society."
6,21,65,JERRY,"Hey, if I knew I had to give him eight million 'thank you's, I wouldn't"
6,21,66,KRAMER,"Alright, you know what this is gonna do? He's gonna be upset because"
6,21,67,JERRY,"Ah, you're out of your mind."
6,21,67,KRAMER,"Alright, where you going?"
6,21,67,JERRY,"I gotta get a suit cleaned, I have a funeral on Friday."
6,21,67,KRAMER,Who died?
6,21,67,JERRY,Remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so O would buy him the
6,21,68,KRAMER,So he actually had it?
6,21,68,JERRY,"No, car accident. He was trying to adjust his toupee while he was"
6,21,70,ELAINE,That poor priest. He was just visiting from El Salvador. Now he's
6,21,71,JERRY,The one Puddy screamed at in the car?
6,21,71,ELAINE,Yeah. He thinks he saw the devil. He won't leave his room in the
6,21,72,JERRY,"Well, that's what you get for getting mixed up with a face painter."
6,21,72,ELAINE,"I mean, what compels a seemingly normal human being to do something"
6,21,73,JERRY,Gotta support the team.
6,21,74,ELAINE,You know I really hate my clothes.
6,21,74,JERRY,Hm.
6,21,74,ELAINE,"I open up my closet, there's just nothing."
6,21,74,JERRY,Hm.
6,21,74,ELAINE,"Nothing. I hate everything I have, I really hate it. (The weeping"
6,21,76,JERRY,Hm.
6,21,76,ELAINE,It's getting to be a terrible problem for me.
6,21,78,JERRY,Did you see that? What kind of a 'hello' was that?
6,21,79,MR. PLESS,"Ah, Mr. Kramer?"
6,21,79,KRAMER,Yes.
6,21,79,MR. PLESS,Thanks for coming.
6,21,79,KRAMER,"So, uh, what did you want to see me about?"
6,21,79,MR. PLESS,"Well, Mr. Kramer, to get right to it, we're having a bit of a"
6,21,80,KRAMER,Barry?
6,21,80,MR. PLESS,The chimpanzee.
6,21,80,KRAMER,"Oh. Well, uh, what's the problem?"
6,21,80,MR. PLESS,"Well, he's not functioning the way he normally does. He seems"
6,21,83,KRAMER,"So, so what do you want me to do?"
6,21,83,MR. PLESS,"Well, frankly we'd like you to apologize."
6,21,83,KRAMER,"Yeah, well he started it."
6,21,83,MR. PLESS,"Mr. Kramer, he is an innocent primate."
6,21,83,KRAMER,So am I. What about my feelings? Don't my feelings count for
6,21,85,SIENA,"Hey, that's ok. Well, I've gotta go feed the marmosets."
6,21,85,KRAMER,You know George really likes you.
6,21,85,MR. PLESS,She doesn't hear too well out of her left ear.
6,21,85,KRAMER,Oh.
6,21,86,JERRY,"I mean, do you think it's possible that he's mad at me because he didn't"
6,21,87,GEORGE,"Wait a minute, you were at a funeral, right?"
6,21,87,JERRY,Yeah.
6,21,87,GEORGE,"Well, people never give a good 'hello' at a funeral. I mean, they go"
6,21,88,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah, that's kinda what he gave me."
6,21,88,GEORGE,"Hey, they can't go, ""Hey! You look fabulous!"""
6,21,89,JERRY,Hey.
6,21,89,KRAMER,"Hey. Well, I just spoke to your girlfriend."
6,21,89,GEORGE,"Girlfriend, yeah, right."
6,21,89,KRAMER,"Anyway, she asked me to apologize to Barry."
6,21,89,GEORGE,Barry?
6,21,89,KRAMER,The monkey.
6,21,89,JERRY,Well?
6,21,89,KRAMER,"Nothing doing. Jerry, I didn't do anything. It's the monkey that"
6,21,90,JERRY,"Well, I don't think that's gonna happen."
6,21,90,KRAMER,"Well, I'm sorry. Well, George, I tried to put the good word in for you"
6,21,91,GEORGE,What?
6,21,91,KRAMER,"Yeah, her boss told me that she can't hear very well out of her left"
6,21,92,GEORGE,Oh my god.
6,21,92,JERRY,What?
6,21,92,GEORGE,She probably never heard it. Don't you see what this means? It's like
6,21,94,JERRY,Are you gonna say it again?
6,21,94,GEORGE,"That's the question, Jimmy."
6,21,95,GEORGE,I'm gonna do it.
6,21,95,JERRY,"What? After what you just went through, I thought you said you'd never"
6,21,96,GEORGE,I'd like to say it once to someone that can actually hear it!
6,21,97,KRAMER,What's going on?
6,21,97,JERRY,He's gonna talk into her other ear.
6,21,97,KRAMER,"Oh. Well listen, I almost forgot to ask you. What happened at the"
6,21,98,JERRY,"Yeah, I saw him."
6,21,98,KRAMER,"Alright, so he's gonna give you the hockey tickets, huh?"
6,21,98,JERRY,"Well, not exactly."
6,21,98,KRAMER,"He's mad, isn't he? See, I knew it."
6,21,98,JERRY,I don't know if he's mad.
6,21,98,KRAMER,"Alright, so what happened when you saw him?"
6,21,98,JERRY,"Well, I didn't really get a good 'hello', but see, I was at a funeral."
6,21,98,KRAMER,Uh huh.
6,21,98,JERRY,"See, so I don't know if I got a funeral 'hello' or he was mad because he"
6,21,99,KRAMER,"See, I told you, Jerry, I told you!"
6,21,99,JERRY,"Look, what do you want me to do?"
6,21,99,KRAMER,I want you to get on this phone and give him his 'thank you'!
6,21,99,JERRY,"No. No, I can't!"
6,21,99,KRAMER,"Jerry, this is the way society functions. Aren't you a part of"
6,21,101,JERRY,"Look, we got five hours before the game. I am betting it was a funeral"
6,21,103,KRAMER,"You stubborn, stupid, silly man!"
6,21,104,PUDDY,"Hey, great dip. You made this?"
6,21,104,ELAINE,"No, it's from the store."
6,21,104,PUDDY,"Oh. Hey, how come people don't have dip for dinner? Why is it only a"
6,21,105,ELAINE,"David? David, I think we aught to talk."
6,21,105,PUDDY,"Alright, that's cool."
6,21,105,ELAINE,"David, I don't think we should see each other anymore."
6,21,105,PUDDY,"You gotta be kidding, how come?"
6,21,105,ELAINE,"Well, you see, David, you're a face painter."
6,21,105,PUDDY,"Yeah, that's right."
6,21,105,ELAINE,"Well, it's not that I don't like you, but, well to be perfectly honest,"
6,21,106,PUDDY,"Well, alright, so you don't like the face painting, I just won't paint"
6,21,107,ELAINE,"Yeah, but you like the face painting."
6,21,107,PUDDY,"Well, I don't need to do it. It's not like a habit or anything."
6,21,107,ELAINE,Oh. You mean you'd stop it for me?
6,21,107,PUDDY,"Yeah, that's right."
6,21,107,ELAINE,"That's so, that's so sweet."
6,21,107,PUDDY,"Ah, c'mere. Alright, I gotta go home and get changed before"
6,21,109,GEORGE,"Siena, I love you."
6,21,109,SIENA,"Yeah, I know. I heard you the first time."
6,21,109,GEORGE,Yeah. Just confirming.
6,21,111,JERRY,"Hello? Oh, hi mom. No, listen, I was expecting somebody else. I'm"
6,21,114,KRAMER,"Anyway, I um, I just want to say that I'm sorry. I lost my temper and"
6,21,124,ELAINE,What is that?
6,21,124,PUDDY,That's the letter 'D'.
6,21,124,ELAINE,Why is the letter 'D' painted on your chest?
6,21,124,PUDDY,"Well, I'm going to the game tonight, and me and these five other guys"
6,21,125,ELAINE,But you said no more painting.
6,21,125,PUDDY,"No, I said no more face painting, and as you can see this is not my"
6,21,126,ELAINE,"Yeah, that's right."
6,21,127,KRAMER,Well? Did he call?
6,21,127,JERRY,No.
6,21,127,KRAMER,"Oh, come on, Jerry! Come on, this is stupid! It's six o'clock! It's"
6,21,128,JERRY,"Alright! Hello, Alec? Hi, it's Jerry"
6,21,130,ALEC,"What can I do for you, Jerry?"
6,21,130,JERRY,"Well, Alec, the reason I called is I just wanted to thank you for the"
6,21,131,ALEC,"I wish you'd called me earlier, I could have given you my tickets for"
6,21,132,JERRY,"Oh, you already gave them away?"
6,21,132,ALEC,"Yeah, but you know what? I have a friend, he's got a couple of seats."
6,21,133,JERRY,"No, we don't care, we just want to go."
6,21,133,ALEC,"There is one little catch, though."
6,21,136,PUDDY,"Hey, great game, huh?"
6,21,142,PRIEST,Father Hernandez?
6,21,142,FATHER HERNANDEZ,Huh?
6,21,142,PRIEST,Una senora que te vino a ver. Ella dice que tiene informacion muy
6,21,143,FATHER HERNANDEZ,Bueno.
6,21,143,PRIEST,"Al fini finalmente paró el llover. (Subtitled: ""Finally it stopped"
6,21,144,FATHER HERNANDEZ,"Aha, bueno."
6,21,147,ELAINE,Hello father.
6,21,147,FATHER HERNANDEZ,Oh. La Madonna! Madre de Christo! Yo estoy lista!
6,21,147,THE END,
