6,3,1,JERRY,Good shave today..
6,3,2,JERRY,I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little..
6,3,2,ELAINE,Can we rest here a second.
6,3,3,JERRY,.. So how's Noreen?
6,3,3,ELAINE,Mm! She's got a new boyfriend: Paul.
6,3,3,JERRY,Already? That was fast.. I assume he's not a High Talker..
6,3,3,ELAINE,"No, but, he has, The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he"
6,3,5,JERRY,A Long Talker.
6,3,5,ELAINE,"Yeah! But he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone:"
6,3,7,JERRY,"Hey, isn't that George's father?"
6,3,7,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah, it is! Should we say hello?"
6,3,7,JERRY,I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.
6,3,7,ELAINE,That man he's with: is he wearing a cape?
6,3,7,JERRY,I believe he is wearing a cape.
6,3,7,ELAINE,Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?
6,3,7,JERRY,"Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy."
6,3,7,ELAINE,"Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?"
6,3,7,JERRY,"You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of"
6,3,13,JERRY,"Just, ah, plop it on the counter there."
6,3,17,ELAINE,That sounds Urgent..
6,3,17,JERRY,Let me call him back..
6,3,19,ELAINE,Donna Chang?
6,3,19,ELAINE,Isn't that a little racist?
6,3,19,JERRY,"If I like their race, how can that be racist?.."
6,3,26,JERRY,So listen..
6,3,26,ELAINE,He's on with a Chinese woman.
6,3,26,KRAMER,"Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women. [a little distracted, pulling"
6,3,27,ELAINE,You got a.. comfort problem there?
6,3,27,KRAMER,"Yeah, I think these Jockeys shrunk."
6,3,27,ELAINE,I thought you wore silk underwear.
6,3,27,KRAMER,"No. Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stay"
6,3,31,KRAMER,Sperm count?
6,3,32,ELAINE,A lot.
6,3,34,JERRY,I got a date!
6,3,34,ELAINE,With the Chinese woman?!
6,3,34,JERRY,She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever
6,3,35,KRAMER,Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?
6,3,35,JERRY,"No, why should I? I wear boxers."
6,3,35,KRAMER,You ever get a woman pregnant?
6,3,35,JERRY,"I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed.."
6,3,35,KRAMER,"What would you say if I told you, ""I never impregnated a woman""?"
6,3,35,JERRY,Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??..
6,3,37,JERRY,"Well, I'm sure you're not.. Totally Depleted."
6,3,37,KRAMER,"Well, but what if I am? I'm the last male Kramer! We're facing extinction!"
6,3,37,JERRY,"Well, go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked."
6,3,37,KRAMER,"Yeah, but then I'd have to.. well, you know.. into a cup? In the middle"
6,3,38,ELAINE,Does that conflict with your regular schedule?
6,3,40,JERRY,I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!
6,3,40,ELAINE,She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?
6,3,40,JERRY,She suggested it!
6,3,40,ELAINE,I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese..
6,3,40,JERRY,She's very assimilated.
6,3,42,JERRY,Paul again?
6,3,43,GEORGE,"Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!"
6,3,43,JERRY,I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!
6,3,43,GEORGE,Uh?
6,3,43,ELAINE,"[coming toward GEORGE to sit over by JERRY, who's on the arm of the"
6,3,45,GEORGE,What's he doin' in the city today?
6,3,46,GEORGE,You didn't ask him?
6,3,47,GEORGE,You didn't say hello?
6,3,47,ELAINE,"Well, he was with someone."
6,3,48,GEORGE,Why was he wearing a cape?..
6,3,49,GEORGE,Was my father wearing a cape?
6,3,49,JERRY,No. Jacket and tie: no cape.
6,3,53,DOCTOR,The results of your sperm test are in.
6,3,54,KRAMER,Yes! I would like to! Very much!..
6,3,55,DOCTOR,"Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low."
6,3,55,KRAMER,Ohhh. Man!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to
6,3,56,DOCTOR,Hey--that's not necessarily true. There are measures you can take to
6,3,57,KRAMER,"All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come"
6,3,58,DOCTOR,First thing: you should wear boxer shorts.
6,3,58,KRAMER,All the time?
6,3,58,DOCTOR,All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.
6,3,58,KRAMER,"Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys."
6,3,60,ELAINE,Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling!
6,3,71,HOSTESS,"Just let me know when the rest of your party has arrived, sir."
6,3,71,JERRY,"Yes, I will."
6,3,72,DONNA,Jerry.
6,3,72,DONNA,Hi. Sorry I'm late.
6,3,72,JERRY,Who're you?
6,3,72,DONNA,I'm Donna Chang..
6,3,72,DONNA,I mean: I'm Donna Chang.
6,3,72,DONNA,Did you think I was Chinese?..
6,3,72,JERRY,"Oh. No. Oh, you mean because of the ""Chang""?"
6,3,72,DONNA,"Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang."
6,3,72,JERRY,I didn't think so.
6,3,72,DONNA,"It used to be ""Changstein."""
6,3,74,ELAINE,She's not Chinese?
6,3,74,JERRY,No. Not Chinese.
6,3,75,ELAINE,So. What is she?
6,3,75,JERRY,"Well, she's.. like you."
6,3,76,JERRY,"Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes"
6,3,78,ELAINE,So why're you seeing her again..
6,3,78,JERRY,"Well, she is a woman."
6,3,78,ELAINE,I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.
6,3,78,JERRY,Really?
6,3,78,ELAINE,"Well, maybe."
6,3,79,JERRY,"Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy.. hangin' up because he"
6,3,82,KRAMER,Here. Take my Jockey shorts.
6,3,84,ELAINE,Whoa! Whoa!
6,3,84,JERRY,What is that?!!
6,3,84,KRAMER,"Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts."
6,3,84,JERRY,Wha--you have a low sperm count?
6,3,84,KRAMER,"Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em."
6,3,84,JERRY,Nnnoo--I don't want 'em.
6,3,84,KRAMER,"Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one"
6,3,85,JERRY,Look! I don't want 'em!
6,3,85,KRAMER,"All it takes is one pair! Now, come on!"
6,3,85,JERRY,I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!
6,3,87,KRAMER,"Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up,"
6,3,92,FRANK,Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.
6,3,92,GEORGE,Plenty of mosquitoes.
6,3,92,FRANK,Queens is full of mosquitoes.
6,3,92,GEORGE,"So, Dad.."
6,3,92,FRANK,"Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken."
6,3,92,GEORGE,Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!
6,3,92,FRANK,Your mother has to tell you every move I make!?
6,3,92,GEORGE,No.. Jerry and Elaine saw you.
6,3,92,FRANK,They didn't say hello?
6,3,92,GEORGE,"Well, they were in a rush."
6,3,92,FRANK,"They couldn't just say hello?! .. Oh, to hell with them."
6,3,92,GEORGE,"They, uh.. said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape, ha ha."
6,3,92,FRANK,"Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the"
6,3,93,GEORGE,So Dad.
6,3,93,FRANK,How could Jerry not say Hello?!!
6,3,95,JERRY,"So did they, uh, uncross the lines, yet?"
6,3,95,DONNA,No. They can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.
6,3,95,JERRY,"[long pause--did he hear ""ridicurous""--should he say something--can't"
6,3,96,DONNA,Ridiculous.
6,3,98,JERRY,"Oh, what are you doing here?"
6,3,101,DONNA,"She was trying to call you, but--"
6,3,101,JERRY,The rines were crossed?
6,3,102,GEORGE,"Did you say, ""The rines were crossed?"""
6,3,102,JERRY,Did I?
6,3,103,GEORGE,Sorry? Why sorry? What do you have to be sorry for?
6,3,103,DONNA,"Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced."
6,3,108,ELAINE,Divorced. That's really too bad..
6,3,108,JERRY,"Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years"
6,3,111,JERRY,I never thought of that.
6,3,112,ELAINE,"Hey George, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?"
6,3,112,JERRY,Have you ever spent any time with these people..?
6,3,112,GEORGE,You know what this has to do with? The man in the cape--I bet you he is
6,3,114,JERRY,You can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a
6,3,116,GEORGE,All right Superman's the exception.
6,3,117,KRAMER,"Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up."
6,3,119,ELAINE,"Oh, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault."
6,3,119,KRAMER,"Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my"
6,3,120,JERRY,Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers..
6,3,120,KRAMER,"Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that."
6,3,120,JERRY,You went back to the Jockeys?
6,3,120,KRAMER,Wrong again.
6,3,120,ELAINE,What? What?..
6,3,120,JERRY,"Don't you see what's goin' on here??? .. No boxers, no Jockeys.."
6,3,120,ELAINE,Eeaawww...
6,3,120,JERRY,The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine..
6,3,120,JERRY,"Kramer, say it isn't so."
6,3,120,KRAMER,"Oh, it be so."
6,3,121,JERRY,Don't you need a little.. help?
6,3,121,KRAMER,"Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered.. [opens door to leave,"
6,3,125,ELAINE,"Well, you guys are tryin' to work it out! That's great!.."
6,3,125,NOREEN,"Yeah, well.. We're trying.. He just went insane there for a while.."
6,3,125,ELAINE,"Oh, he went insane?.."
6,3,125,NOREEN,Believe it or not: Paul was convinced I was having an affair because
6,3,132,ELAINE,Hey! Noreen! Don't go by me! Ha ha.
6,3,133,JERRY,What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship
6,3,134,ELAINE,I know--
6,3,134,JERRY,First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.
6,3,134,ELAINE,"Well, Jer--I got confused, they sound exactly the same."
6,3,134,JERRY,"So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets: A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're"
6,3,135,JERRY,"Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman!"
6,3,137,JERRY,Yeah.
6,3,137,DONNA,It's Donna Chang.
6,3,137,ELAINE,"Well, I guess I just didn't realize it.."
6,3,137,JERRY,"Well, let's look back on your history with this woman. Okay?"
6,3,137,ELAINE,Okay..
6,3,137,JERRY,"First, you encouraged her to join: The Army. .. She did."
6,3,137,ELAINE,She was lost..
6,3,137,JERRY,Then: you suggest she goes.. AWOL! She did!
6,3,137,ELAINE,"Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun.."
6,3,137,JERRY,You know.. You better make sure you never tell this woman to jump off
6,3,138,ELAINE,"If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an'"
6,3,140,DONNA,Hi.
6,3,140,JERRY,"Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine.."
6,3,142,JERRY,Why? What happened?
6,3,142,DONNA,"Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for"
6,3,143,JERRY,Wow! That's amazing!
6,3,143,DONNA,"Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner! She said"
6,3,144,JERRY,Tonight?
6,3,144,DONNA,Yeah--I just remembered: I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class.
6,3,148,GEORGE,All right. Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is goin'
6,3,151,FRANK,Yeah. We worked it out.
6,3,151,GEORGE,All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?
6,3,151,FRANK,He was my lawyer.
6,3,151,GEORGE,You lawyer wears a cape..?
6,3,151,FRANK,Yeah. So what?
6,3,151,GEORGE,Who wears a cape?
6,3,151,FRANK,He's very independent; doesn't follow the trends.
6,3,151,ESTELLE,He looks ridiculous in that thing..
6,3,151,FRANK,You have no eye for fashion!!!
6,3,151,ESTELLE,I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!
6,3,151,GEORGE,All right! Come on!
6,3,154,ESTELLE,Georgie's right.
6,3,154,GEORGE,So what made you change your mind?
6,3,154,ESTELLE,It was that Chinese woman.
6,3,155,JERRY,So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?
6,3,155,DONNA,I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.
6,3,155,DONNA,Yeah.
6,3,156,JERRY,Hey! I heard the good news!
6,3,156,FRANK,"Jerry: how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!"
6,3,156,JERRY,Elaine was.. in a rush.
6,3,156,FRANK,I knew it was Elaine!!
6,3,156,DONNA,You must be Estelle.
6,3,156,ESTELLE,Yes. Who are you..?
6,3,156,DONNA,I'm Donna Chang!
6,3,156,ESTELLE,You're not Chinese!
6,3,159,KRAMER,Hello?
6,3,159,ELAINE,Paul?
6,3,159,KRAMER,Elaine!
6,3,159,ELAINE,Kramer?
6,3,159,ELAINE,What're you doin' there?
6,3,159,KRAMER,"Wellll, isn't it obvious?"
6,3,159,ELAINE,"Uh! Ah, is Noreen there?"
6,3,159,KRAMER,"Yes, she is.."
6,3,159,ELAINE,Well? Can I talk to her?
6,3,159,KRAMER,"What? Am I, tooo.. boring for you?"
6,3,159,KRAMER,"Well, I feel it'd be best if you just didn't talk to her for a while.."
6,3,159,ELAINE,You feel?
6,3,159,KRAMER,That's right!
6,3,161,ELAINE,What are you insane?!
6,3,161,KRAMER,"From now, on, I'll be calling the shots around here.."
6,3,161,ELAINE,Oh! Haha. An' what're you gonna tell her?
6,3,161,KRAMER,Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army..
6,3,163,ELAINE,Uh! Kramer! You have got to let me talk to her!
6,3,163,KRAMER,"Can't help ya, kid."
6,3,164,ESTELLE,You're not Chinese!?!?
6,3,164,ESTELLE,I thought you were Chinese!!
6,3,164,DONNA,I'm from Long Island.
6,3,164,ESTELLE,Long Island?!?!
6,3,165,DONNA,I'm sorry..?
6,3,165,ESTELLE,"Well! Then, that changes everything!"
6,3,165,GEORGE,What?!
6,3,165,ESTELLE,She's not Chinese; I was duped!!
6,3,165,GEORGE,So what?! She gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chi
6,3,166,ESTELLE,I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! [goes into
6,3,166,KITCHEN],
6,3,170,ELAINE,"So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!"
6,3,170,JERRY,Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the
6,3,175,GEORGE,"Oh, it had to happen!! I knew it!!"
6,3,175,JERRY,Hey.
6,3,183,KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live on! Noreen's late!"
6,3,187,NOREEN,Who are you?!
6,3,188,THE END,
