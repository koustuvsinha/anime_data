6,8,9,JERRY,From your mother.
6,8,11,JERRY,"So this ah, woman you plan on hiring, is she going to be in the"
6,8,12,GEORGE,"Sure. I could go the tomato route. But eh, I've given this a"
6,8,15,JERRY,"That's a 180, George."

6,8,18,DONNA,Hi.
6,8,18,JERRY,Hi.
6,8,18,WILLIE,"Hey Jerry, you know my wife Donna."

6,8,19,WILLIE,"Whoa, this is a beauty. Great cut. It's probably very"
6,8,20,JERRY,"Oh yes, it really accentuates my bust line."
6,8,23,APPLICANT,"Well, I type about 90 words a minute. I'm completely"
6,8,24,GEORGE,"Well Miss Coggins you're ah, obviously"
6,8,30,GEORGE,You're luscious. You're ravishing. I would give up red meat
6,8,34,ADE,As you can see my references are impeccable. I think I'd be a real
6,8,36,GEORGE,I can't imagine.
6,8,38,ELAINE,"Ok, So Barney's is having this huge sale. I try this dress on"
6,8,40,JERRY,Yeah.
6,8,40,ELAINE,
6,8,41,JERRY,"So you're saying, Store -- Hotsy-Totsy, Home-- Hotsy-Notsy."
6,8,41,ELAINE,Yeah exactly. Anyway I've got to go over there and return it.
6,8,41,JERRY,I thought we were going to the movies?
6,8,41,ELAINE,All right I'll try it on again. You tell me what you think.
6,8,43,GEORGE,Hey hey.
6,8,43,ELAINE,Hey George
6,8,43,GEORGE,Hey Elaine. I'm
6,8,45,JERRY,Because you didn't have a job?
6,8,45,GEORGE,"Perhaps. I walk in, everything is organized -- messages,"
6,8,47,JERRY,A lesser man would have crumbled. They would have gone for the
6,8,52,JERRY,It's a little ...
6,8,52,ELAINE,All Right! You answered it right there.
6,8,52,JERRY,You got no waist in that thing.
6,8,52,GEORGE,You arms look like something hanging in a kosher deli.
6,8,52,ELAINE,"I said, All Right."
6,8,52,GEORGE,Well wha'd you buy it for?
6,8,52,ELAINE,"Why did I buy it, because in the mirror, at Barney's, I looked"
6,8,54,JERRY,How fast was she walking?
6,8,56,GEORGE,Demi? I thought it was Demi?
6,8,56,JERRY,No. I think it's Demi.

6,8,66,KRAMER,Whoa. What are you all dressed up for?
6,8,66,ELAINE,Oh I'm returning this dress to Barney's.

6,8,66,ELAINE,"Yeah yeah, ok."
6,8,66,KRAMER,"Hey look, if you're going there, maybe you could pick me up some"
6,8,67,ELAINE,Moisturizer? That's girls stuff.
6,8,67,KRAMER,"No no, look. I'll tell you what -- they're having a sale right."
6,8,67,ELAINE,yeah.
6,8,67,KRAMER,"I'll meetcha down there, well have lunch."
6,8,67,ELAINE,Well we could ...

6,8,77,ADE,
6,8,79,GEORGE,"Ade, I have to tell you, I, I have never met anybody so ..."
6,8,80,ADE,"Well thank you, I'm flattered."
6,8,80,GEORGE,"I mean you're just, you're just a marvel of organization."
6,8,80,ADE,"Well I'm just, hm, doing my job."
6,8,80,GEORGE,"It's like I'm thinking of something, and you're"
6,8,81,ADE,What can I say? I'm ... I'm good at what I do. (smiling and
6,8,82,GEORGE,"(coyly, he looks down and runs his finger along the top of the"
6,8,84,ADE,"Yes, I think I"
6,8,85,GEORGE,"Is it, uh, doable?"
6,8,85,ADE,It's definitely doable.
6,8,94,JERRY,"Well, that was the worst."
6,8,94,ELAINE,I can't believe they made the Wife the killer. (putting on
6,8,95,MAN,"Hey, give us a"
6,8,96,ANOTHER MAN,Yeah! (in
6,8,98,KRAMER,You got a pen?
6,8,98,JERRY,"Yeah, I think I do."
6,8,98,KRAMER,And I need something to write on.
6,8,98,JERRY,"Well, all I got is my dry-cleaning stub."
6,8,98,KRAMER,I gust met Uma Therman. She's giving me her telephone number.
6,8,99,JERRY,Uma Therman? Really?
6,8,99,KRAMER,Yeah.
6,8,99,ELAINE,How'd you manage that.
6,8,99,KRAMER,Yeah well I don't have any time to talk now. (he rushes back
6,8,100,JERRY,"He's got the Kavorca. (looking towards the theater door, Jerry"
6,8,101,ELAINE,Where?
6,8,101,JERRY,"He just went in. You know, I think he was wearing my"
6,8,102,ELAINE,What would he be doing wearing your jacket?
6,8,102,JERRY,It looked just like the jacket I brought in to be dry-cleaned.
6,8,103,ELAINE,Are you sure?
6,8,104,KRAMER,"I got it. Uma, Uma, Uma."
6,8,104,ELAINE,You are amazing.
6,8,104,KRAMER,"Yeah, all right. Taxi's on me."
6,8,107,ADE,Ah no no no no no. A better way to reach the bra would be to undo
6,8,108,GEORGE,Ade you are incredible
6,8,112,ADE,"Oh ...oh ...oh ... Here, I want to show you something. Hand me"
6,8,116,GEORGE,"What? Oh, My God!"
6,8,116,ADE,Mr. CO STAN ZA!
6,8,116,GEORGE,"Ade, ahh, ahh, ah ... I'm giving you a raise!"
6,8,118,JERRY,"So you're having sex and then all of a sudden, you just blurt out"
6,8,119,GEORGE,Yeah.
6,8,119,JERRY,Just a quick sidebar here -- are you in anyway authorized to give
6,8,120,GEORGE,"Not that I'm aware of, no."
6,8,120,JERRY,"So you're so grateful to have sex, that you'll just shout out"
6,8,121,GEORGE,I didn't think ahead.
6,8,121,JERRY,Well maybe she'll just think it was bawdy talk.
6,8,121,GEORGE,I didn't say any other bawdy things.
6,8,121,JERRY,Maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back.
6,8,121,GEORGE,"All right, you know you're not any help at all here. I don't"
6,8,123,JERRY,"All right, all right. I'm sorry."
6,8,123,GEORGE,"Yeah, well, I guess the only thing I can do is go into George"
6,8,124,JERRY,How long has she been there?
6,8,124,GEORGE,3 days.
6,8,124,JERRY,It's almost a week.
6,8,129,JERRY,"Oh, My god."
6,8,129,GEORGE,What?
6,8,129,JERRY,"It's a movie stub from the 9:30 show. George, I think Willie the"
6,8,136,ELAINE,These mirrors are skinny mirrors. This is false ...
6,8,139,ELAINE,
6,8,141,ELAINE,Ok thanks so much. (the Barney's sales associate turns and walks
6,8,143,KRAMER,"Well Elaine, when you're shopping on Madison Avenue, you don't"
6,8,144,ELAINE,I like your little bag.
6,8,144,KRAMER,"Huh, oh hey, look at this. (he pulls a little tube out of the"
6,8,145,ELAINE,Huh.

6,8,150,KRAMER,"Well, thank you."
6,8,150,BANIA,Did you get that here?
6,8,150,KRAMER,"No, this is vintage. They don't make this stuff anymore."
6,8,150,BANIA,You're telling me.

6,8,159,STEINBRENNER,Is that a fact George?
6,8,159,GEORGE,"Yes, In fact, her mother is in the hospital right now. It's"
6,8,161,STEINBRENNER,I had a bout of that myself one time -- knocked me right
6,8,162,GEORGE,She can't even afford to go out to lunch. She's been eating in
6,8,163,STEINBRENNER,"What's that cost her, like, two and a quarter?"
6,8,163,GEORGE,You know what I was just thinking -- she could really use a
6,8,165,STEINBRENNER,"You know, she'd be better off making a sandwich at home"
6,8,172,KRAMER,Psst. Hey.
6,8,174,ELAINE,"Kramer, what are you doing here?"
6,8,174,KRAMER,"Listen, I need you to get me some clothes."

6,8,180,JERRY,I saw you the other night stepping out with my Hounds-Tooth
6,8,181,WILLIE,Jerry that's a breach of the dry-cleaner's code.
6,8,181,JERRY,You need a code to tell you not to wear peoples' clothes
6,8,181,WILLIE,I wasn't wearing your jacket. Jerry you're imagining things.
6,8,183,JERRY,"Yeahhh, am I imagining this? (he whips out the movie stub and"
6,8,185,WILLIE,Jerry.
6,8,185,JERRY,"Yeah, Yeah. Well, now that we understand each other -- I'll be"

6,8,192,JERRY,"All right, I'll be back."
6,8,194,ELAINE,"Yeah it looks good here, but what does that mean?"
6,8,194,ELAINE,"I don't know, I have to think about it. (the sales associate"
6,8,199,ADE,"I can't thank you enough, Mr. Costanza. I'm so grateful"
6,8,199,GEORGE,"Yes, well, I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner. I told him you"
6,8,202,ADE,It was just so generous.
6,8,202,GEORGE,"Oh, well, don't worry about it -- he's got plenty of money."
6,8,203,ADE,"Oh I know, but Twenty Five Thousand."
6,8,203,GEORGE,"So you got a $25,000 a year"

6,8,222,KRAMER,"Well, I sold them to Bania."
6,8,222,JERRY,What? You sold your pants to Bania. Let me in.
6,8,224,JERRY,Why'd you sell your pants to Bania?

6,8,238,KRAMER,Uma's number is on that ticket.
6,8,238,JERRY,"Never mind Uma, I need that ticket to get my mother's fur coat"
6,8,239,KRAMER,I'm not going to give him $300 now for a suit with moisturizer
6,8,240,JERRY,I got an idea.
6,8,240,KRAMER,What?
6,8,240,JERRY,I can't believe I'm gonna do this. (Jerry opens the door and
6,8,241,JERRY,Bania can I talk to you for a second? How's everything going?
6,8,241,BANIA,Pretty good.
6,8,241,JERRY,"Yeah, well, see the thing of it is, I'm in a bit of an awkward"
6,8,244,BANIA,"Well all you gotta do is tell Kramer to give me my money back,"

6,8,253,STEINBRENNER,"Uh huh, I understand what you're saying George and I know"
6,8,258,STEINBRENNER,I couldn't look at a donut for the next two years. Well
6,8,262,STEINBRENNER,"Sure I like a cup cake every now and then, like everybody"
6,8,268,JERRY,"Let me in, it's me. (Kramer opens the door, Jerry goes in the"

6,8,273,KRAMER,It must
6,8,274,JERRY,Give me that.
6,8,276,JERRY,"Hey Bania, the dinners off. The ticket's no good. The numbers"
6,8,277,BANIA,You trying
6,8,278,JERRY,The ticket is worthless.

6,8,283,JERRY,"Hey, Isn't that my mother's fur coat?"
6,8,290,DONNA,No it's not.
6,8,290,JERRY,It is! (Jerry walks forcefully into the dressing room and closes
6,8,291,DONNA,"No, what are you talking about."
6,8,294,DONNA,Are you out of your mind? Don't you ... take your hands ...
6,8,294,JERRY,"You can't have that coat, it's not yours."
6,8,297,JERRY,What do you think the dry-cleaner's is your own personal closet!
6,8,302,ELAINE,"Donna, do you think you can get the salt stain out of this?"
6,8,303,DONNA,Let me see. Piece of cake. Bring it
6,8,304,ELAINE,"(Tilts her head down, looking over her glasses in amazement of"
6,8,325,BANIA,Mmm. This soup is great.
6,8,325,JERRY,"Yeah, it's very good."
6,8,325,BANIA,"I told you Mendy's had the best pea soup. The best Jerry, the"

6,8,331,BANIA,"Yeah. Well, let's hurry up and eat I gotta get out of here. I'm"
6,8,332,JERRY,"Oh, and who might that be?"
6,8,332,BANIA,Some woman named Uma. I got her number off of that ticket before
6,8,335,JERRY,"If you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant, I'm telling you right now, I don't want to hear about the specials. I don't want to know about the specials. I'm sick of the specials. I hate the specials. My feeling is, if the specials were so special, they'd be on the menu. You know what's special about them? They don't know if anybody likes them. They always have these overly creative descriptions of the specials too, you know. The veil is lightly slapped, and then sequestered in a one-bedroom suite with a white wine intravenous."
6,8,335,THE END,
