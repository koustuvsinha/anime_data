6,9,1,LANDIS,Jocylin Landis from Doubleday. I interviewed you for a position
6,9,2,ELAINE,"Yes, yes, the one I didn't get."
6,9,2,LANDIS,I was watching you play
6,9,2,ELAINE,"Oh, I'm not very good."
6,9,2,LANDIS,No. You exhibited a lot of grace out there.
6,9,2,ELAINE,Really? Grace?
6,9,2,LANDIS,Yes. So have you found anything yet?
6,9,2,ELAINE,"Uh, no. Not really."
6,9,2,LANDIS,You know you should keep in touch. Something may be opening
6,9,3,JERRY,"Oh, Bruline. Newman's got the same one."
6,9,3,ELAINE,Newman plays tennis?
6,9,3,JERRY,He's fantastic.
6,9,3,LANDIS,Would you mind if I tried this out?
6,9,3,ELAINE,"Uh, no ... take it."
6,9,3,LANDIS,How will you get it back?
6,9,3,ELAINE,"Um, I could come by your office and pick it up tomorrow."

6,9,6,GEORGE,What's that.
6,9,6,KRAMER,"Ya' know, people who glitter. She's a slim gal."
6,9,6,GEORGE,And the amazing thing is she eats like there's no tomorra'.

6,9,17,NINA,"George I need to freshen., George, George, George ..."
6,9,18,JERRY,It was unbelievable. You're right the jokes kept bouncing off her
6,9,19,ELAINE,"See, what did I tell ya?"
6,9,19,JERRY,"And even when she did like something, she doesn't laugh. She"
6,9,20,ELAINE,"Oo, I better call that woman at Doubleday and see when I can"

6,9,41,JERRY,"Well, why don't you wait 'til she's not there on her lunch hour and just"
6,9,42,ELAINE,That's stealing?
6,9,42,JERRY,Stealing? You loaned her the racquet!
6,9,42,ELAINE,I know.
6,9,43,GEORGE,Hey oh.
6,9,43,ELAINE,
6,9,43,JERRY,So what happened with Kramer's mother?

6,9,44,JERRY,What's she like?
6,9,44,GEORGE,"Oh, she's a Kramer. And uh, while I was there I uh happened to pick up"

6,9,45,GEORGE,Cosmo
6,9,45,ELAINE,
6,9,45,GEORGE,Cosmo
6,9,45,ELAINE,
6,9,46,ELAINE,"Cosmo, Cosmo?"
6,9,47,KRAMER,What's so funny? ... wha?
6,9,47,KRAMER,"All right, OK So you the name now. The cat is .a a a .. out of the bag."
6,9,49,ELAINE,It's not such a bad name.
6,9,49,KRAMER,Well you know all my life I've been running away from that name.
6,9,54,LAURA,Yes?
6,9,54,JERRY,"Hi, is Sandy here?"
6,9,54,LAURA,"Hi, you must be Jerry. Sandy's in the shower. Do you want to come in?"
6,9,54,JERRY,I would except I forgot to bring a towel.
6,9,54,LAURA,
6,9,56,JERRY,So the roommate laughed at everything I said.
6,9,56,GEORGE,Wow.
6,9,56,JERRY,"It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none of"
6,9,57,GEORGE,"Oh yeah: HA-A-A, HA-A-A."
6,9,57,JERRY,Yeah.
6,9,57,GEORGE,"Hate the big coarse ""ha."" Hate those."
6,9,57,JERRY,And the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the
6,9,58,GEORGE,I see.
6,9,58,JERRY,"So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here."
6,9,58,GEORGE,"Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my advice to you"
6,9,60,JERRY,"Can't be done, huh?"
6,9,60,GEORGE,The Switch?
6,9,60,JERRY,"""The Switch."""
6,9,60,GEORGE,Can't be done.
6,9,60,JERRY,I wonder.
6,9,60,GEORGE,Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization no one has
6,9,62,JERRY,They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.
6,9,62,GEORGE,"Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and"
6,9,63,JERRY,The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it with or without
6,9,66,GEORGE,"All right, dammit, I'm in."
6,9,66,JERRY,I couldn't do it without you.
6,9,66,GEORGE,All right. Let's get to work.
6,9,70,GEORGE,All right. That's enough for today. You're tired. Get some sleep. I'll see
6,9,71,JERRY,"Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? It's impossible! It's true! You"
6,9,74,GEORGE,We'll come up with something.
6,9,74,JERRY,"Yeah, sure we will."
6,9,74,GEORGE,"All right. See you tomorrow. {George sighs, exits.}"
6,9,75,GEORGE,
6,9,78,GEORGE,"All right. Let's go over it again, one more time."
6,9,78,JERRY,All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a ménage à trois with her
6,9,79,GEORGE,That's right.
6,9,79,JERRY,And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect.
6,9,82,GEORGE,Keep going.
6,9,82,JERRY,"At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to"
6,9,83,GEORGE,Continue.
6,9,83,JERRY,The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as
6,9,86,GEORGE,A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy is known to
6,9,89,JERRY,"Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw in it:"
6,9,92,GEORGE,"You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do with you. She"
6,9,95,JERRY,It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.
6,9,95,GEORGE,"{George, finger in the peanut butter jar}: This is what I do."
6,9,97,KEITH,Can I help you?
6,9,97,ELAINE,"Uh, no, I'm OK."
6,9,97,KEITH,Well then what are you doing with that racquet?
6,9,97,ELAINE,"Um, it's mine. Miss. Landis borrowed it."
6,9,97,KEITH,"Well, I'm sorry you can't take that, no no no.."
6,9,97,ELAINE,"No no no, I can. I can. It's mine. It's my racquet."
6,9,97,KEITH,Look sweetheart I don't know who you are. I don't know what you're doing
6,9,98,ELAINE,All right. I'm going I'm going
6,9,98,KEITH,Not with ...
6,9,98,ELAINE,Give it give it ..
6,9,98,KEITH,Leave ...
6,9,98,ELAINE,All right all right forget it. You don't have to mention any of this to
6,9,99,KEITH,I don't have to but I will.

6,9,123,GEORGE,"You're not goin to do it? What do you mean, You're not goin"
6,9,124,JERRY,I can't. I'm not an orgy guy.
6,9,124,GEORGE,Are you crazy? This is like discovering Plutonium ... by accident.
6,9,124,JERRY,Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy? It changes
