7,11,39,ELAINE,"A very traditional, a very supportive, brazier."
7,11,39,JERRY,There's nothing subtle about that.
7,11,39,GEORGE,"No, no, she might just think its a gift."
7,11,39,JERRY,Have I ever bought you a jock strap as a gift?

7,11,67,ELAINE,"My God, are you okay?"
7,11,67,KRAMER,I got a cut on my head and I banged my shoulder.
7,11,67,JERRY,"I guess I have to bring his car back up to the stadium, if it"
7,11,68,ELAINE,So how did this happen?
7,11,68,JERRY,He was starin' at some woman!
7,11,68,KRAMER,"I couldn't help it, you saw what she was wearing."
7,11,68,ELAINE,What woman?
7,11,68,JERRY,There was this beautiful woman walking down the street wearing
7,11,69,ELAINE,Oh...my God.
7,11,69,JERRY,What?
7,11,69,ELAINE,"Was it a tall woman, in a black blazer?"
7,11,69,JERRY,Yeah!
7,11,69,ELAINE,Ohhh! That's Sue Ellen Mishke!
7,11,69,JERRY,Sue Ellen Mishke?
7,11,69,ELAINE,"That's the bra I gave here, she's wearing it as a top! The"
7,11,71,KRAMER,"You know, my arm really hurts. I wonder if its gonna affect my"
7,11,74,STAN,"I got your message, how's the shoulder?"
7,11,74,KRAMER,"Yeah, it's my left arm, I can't swing it!"
7,11,74,STAN,"No, no. Not the left arm!"
7,11,74,KRAMER,"What happens if I can't play like I was? What about the tour,"
7,11,75,ELAINE,Oh! I got it! Let's sue her!
7,11,75,KRAMER,Sue her?
7,11,75,ELAINE,"Yeah, she's loaded. She's the heiress to the O'Henry candy bar"
7,11,76,KRAMER,"No, no, no, I can't. I learned my lesson from that coffee"
7,11,77,ELAINE,"Kramer, listen to me. Listen! This is a once in a lifetime"
7,11,79,KRAMER,"What do you think, Stan?"
7,11,79,STAN,Let's go for the green! You know a good lawyer?
7,11,81,JACKIE,"So you're driving in the car, you're with your friend, minding"
7,11,82,KRAMER,Yeah.
7,11,82,JACKIE,Then what happened?
7,11,82,KRAMER,"The we saw this woman, and she was wearing a bra with no top."
7,11,82,JACKIE,No top? She didn't have a top on?
7,11,82,KRAMER,No. So I got distracted and I crashed the car.
7,11,82,JACKIE,Well how would you describe this woman? Would you say she was
7,11,83,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah."
7,11,83,JACKIE,"So we got an attractive woman, wearing a bra, no top, walkin'"
7,11,84,KRAMER,She was flouting.
7,11,84,JACKIE,"That's totally inappropriate. It's lewd, vesivius, salacious,"
7,11,85,KRAMER,It was outrageous. And she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar
7,11,86,JACKIE,Could you repeat that?
7,11,86,KRAMER,I said she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
7,11,86,JACKIE,O'Henry? That's one of our top-selling candy bars. It's got
7,11,88,KRAMER,No.
7,11,88,JACKIE,"Susie, call Dr. Bison, set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer, tell him it's for me."
7,11,88,KRAMER,"So whadda ya think, Jackie? I mean we got a case?"
7,11,88,JACKIE,Like taking candy from a baby.
7,11,89,GEORGE,I think I got it. How 'bout this? How 'bout this? We trade Jim
7,11,92,SUSAN,"I don't know, George. I'm still worried about this car thing."
7,11,92,GEORGE,Would ya stop worrying?
7,11,92,SUSAN,"Well, what about the flyers?"
7,11,92,GEORGE,"Jerry took the flyers off the car, I got the whole thing"
7,11,98,STEINBRENNER,Come in!
7,11,99,STEINBRENNER,"Ah, Wilhelm."
7,11,99,WILHELM,"Mr. Steinbrenner, I am very concerned about George Costanza."
7,11,99,STEINBRENNER,How 'bout a 'good morning'?
7,11,99,WILHELM,"Yes sir, good morning, good morning, sir."
7,11,99,STEINBRENNER,"Good morning to you, Wilhelm."
7,11,99,WILHELM,"Anyway, his car's in the parking lot, the front end is based"
7,11,102,STEINBRENNER,"Alright, Wilhelm, listen to me. I want the stadium"
7,11,105,WILHELM,"Yes sir, yes sir."
7,11,105,STEINBRENNER,"We must find George, find him, Wilhelm!"
7,11,108,SUE ELLEN,"Excuse me, do you happen to know the gentleman across the"
7,11,109,JERRY,"Yes, yes, I do."
7,11,109,SUE ELLEN,Do you happen to know if he'll be back anytime soon?
7,11,109,JERRY,"No, I don't."
7,11,109,SUE ELLEN,Oh...
7,11,109,JERRY,Is there something I can help you with?
7,11,109,SUE ELLEN,"No, I really just needed to speak with him."
7,11,109,JERRY,"Well, you can wait for him in here if you like."
7,11,109,SUE ELLEN,"Oh, maybe I will."
7,11,110,SUE ELLEN,If you don't mind.
7,11,110,JERRY,"No, no, not at all."
7,11,110,SUE ELLEN,Thanks.
7,11,110,JERRY,I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
7,11,111,STEINBRENNER,"What is with these people, all day long. Come in, come"
7,11,112,WILHELM,"Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, you know, we've searched everywhere,"
7,11,114,STEINBRENNER,"Oh my God, do you know what this means, Wilhelm?"
7,11,114,WILHELM,"What, sir?"
7,11,114,STEINBRENNER,He's dead! Costanza's dead!
7,11,114,WILHELM,"Well, no, no, you see, I don't think--"
7,11,114,STEINBRENNER,"As quickly as he came here, he's gone. The poor little"
7,11,115,WILHELM,Yessir?
7,11,115,STEINBRENNER,Find out where his parents live.
7,11,115,WILHELM,Parents.
7,11,115,STEINBRENNER,"I'm gonna personally notify them. ...and, ah, line up"
7,11,120,KRAMER,"Well, buddy, he's taking the case! Jackie Chiles is right on"
7,11,121,JERRY,"Oh, really?"
7,11,121,KRAMER,"Why, wh-wh-what's wrong, come on?"
7,11,121,JERRY,"I don't know, so the woman was walking around in a bra, I mean"
7,11,123,KRAMER,"Well, your attitude has certainly changed."
7,11,123,JERRY,I don't think my attitude has changed.
7,11,123,KRAMER,"Now listen, Jerry, I'm gonna need you to testify."
7,11,123,JERRY,"Well, I don't know if I...."
7,11,123,KRAMER,"Jerry, Jerry, you gotta testify!"
7,11,123,JERRY,I don't think I--
7,11,123,KRAMER,"Listen, this is a million dollars we're talkin' about, Jerry,"
7,11,125,JERRY,"Well, I'm just not sure how I feel about it, Kramer."
7,11,125,KRAMER,"Alright what's gotten into you, what's happened?!?"
7,11,125,JERRY,Nothing's happened.
7,11,125,KRAMER,Goohhhhck.
7,11,127,KRAMER,"Ohhhh, what's this?"
7,11,127,JERRY,"Oh, no, no, no, wait a second, wait a second,..."
7,11,127,KRAMER,"I see....Yessss. Little Miss Candy Bar paid a visit, didn't"
7,11,128,JERRY,"Kramer, it is not what you think."
7,11,128,KRAMER,"Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh! I know what I think. I think you're gaga over"
7,11,131,JERRY,And what about yooou?!? Tryin' to bilk an innocent bystander
7,11,133,KRAMER,You're just out for sex!
7,11,133,JERRY,You're just out for money!
7,11,133,KRAMER AND JERRY,"Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh!"
7,11,135,STEINBRENNER,Mrs. Costanza?
7,11,135,ESTELLE,Yesss?
7,11,135,STEINBRENNER,"My name is George Steinbrenner, I'm afraid I have some"
7,11,137,ESTELLE,"I can't believe it, he was so young. How could this"
7,11,138,STEINBRENNER,"Well, he'd been logging some pretty heavy hours, first"
7,11,140,ESTELLE,Are you sure you're talking about George?
7,11,140,STEINBRENNER,You are Mr. and Mrs. Costanza?
7,11,140,FRANK,What the hell did you trade Jay Buhner for?!? He had
7,11,142,STEINBRENNER,"Well, Buener was a good prospect, no question about it."
7,11,146,FRANK,"Jerry, it's Frank Costanza, Mr. Steinbrenner is here, George is dead, call me back!"
7,11,147,JERRY,Hello?
7,11,147,GEORGE,"Hey, it's George."
7,11,147,JERRY,Where have you been?!?
7,11,147,GEORGE,What?
7,11,147,JERRY,"I just got the most bizarre message from you father,"
7,11,148,GEORGE,Dead?
7,11,148,JERRY,"Yeah, and we had an accident with your car, it's a little"
7,11,149,GEORGE,My car is a little crumpled?!?
7,11,149,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the"
7,11,152,GEORGE,"Okay, I gotta head back right away, I'll -- I gotta figure"
7,11,153,JERRY,Well you gotta call your parents.
7,11,153,GEORGE,"I can't, Steinbrenner might still be there!"
7,11,153,JERRY,Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive?
7,11,153,GEORGE,Nnnooo! They could use the break!
7,11,155,PETERMAN,"Elaine, do you see this? Do you see what"
7,11,156,ELAINE,"Yeah, it's a bra."
7,11,156,PETERMAN,I saw a woman in our hallway wearing one of these as a top.
7,11,159,ELAINE,What is this all about?
7,11,159,PETERMAN,I wanna market this item as a new direction in women's
7,11,162,STEINBRENNER,"Come in, come in."
7,11,163,GEORGE,Mr. Steinbrenner--
7,11,163,STEINBRENNER,"Ahhh, Ahhh! Ah, ah ah! Is it you?"
7,11,163,GEORGE,"Yeah, it's me sir. It's been a harrowing few days. After the"
7,11,165,STEINBRENNER,"Grubs, huh? Gotta admit, I never tasted one of those."
7,11,165,GEORGE,"Anyway, as I was lying in the puddle, I think I may have found"
7,11,167,STEINBRENNER,"Well, don't tell it to me George, tell it to the new"
7,11,168,GEORGE,I didn't get the job?
7,11,168,STEINBRENNER,"Well, once you were dead, we couldn't just sit on our"
7,11,171,STEINBRENNER,"But, you still have your old job. Of course, we'll have"
7,11,176,JACKIE,So it was the meeting on the street that prompted you to buy
7,11,177,ELAINE,"Yes...ummm, yes, that's correct."
7,11,178,JACKIE,"And you have also brought with you, another bra, exactly like"
7,11,179,ELAINE,"Yes, that's correct."
7,11,180,JACKIE,"What was you golf score, the last round you played...before you"
7,11,181,KRAMER,Three under par.
7,11,182,JACKIE,"Oooohhhh, three under par...That's what the"
7,11,183,KRAMER,If they're lucky.
7,11,185,JACKIE,Would you tell this jury exactly what you saw on the corner of
7,11,186,JERRY,I...don't remember.
7,11,186,JACKIE,"Well, did you, or did you not, see the defendant, wearing the"
7,11,187,JERRY,I don't know. Maybe.
7,11,187,JACKIE,"Mr. Seinfeld, I might remind you that you are under oath. Now"
7,11,189,JERRY,"....Alright, alright, I saw her! And she was beautiful in that"
7,11,191,JUDGE,This court will come to order!
7,11,191,JACKIE,"No further questions, your honor."
7,11,191,JUDGE,You may step down.
7,11,191,JACKIE,I think we got this wrapped up.
7,11,191,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah...What's your read, Stan?"
7,11,191,STAN,"You're close, you're on the green. You just have to go for the cup."
7,11,191,KRAMER,What do you mean?
7,11,191,STAN,"Have her try on the bra, see if it fits."
7,11,191,JACKIE,"No, no, no, no!"
7,11,191,KRAMER,"Do it, Jackie. Stan's the man."
7,11,191,JACKIE,Stan? Who the hell is Stan?
7,11,191,KRAMER,He's my caddy.
7,11,191,JACKIE,You're caddy?!? This is a big mistake!
7,11,191,KRAMER,
7,11,191,JACKIE,"Your honor, we request at this time, that Miss Mishke...try on the bra."
7,11,191,JUDGE,"This court will come to order! Go ahead Miss Mishke, try it on."
7,11,193,SUE ELLEN,"Ah, it doesn't fit...I can't put it on."
7,11,193,JACKIE,"Damn fools! Look at that! We got nothin' now, nothin'! I've been practicing law for 25 years, you're listenin' to a caddy! This is a public humiliation! You can't let the defendant have control of the key piece of evidence. Plus, she's trying it on over a leotard, of course a bra's not gonna fit on over a leotard. A bra gotta fit right up a person's skin, like a glove!"
7,11,195,WOMAN #1,"Oh, hey, Elaine, how 'bout some lunch?"
7,11,195,ELAINE,"Oh, no, I don't think so."
7,11,195,WOMAN #2,Great job on the Gatzby Swing Top. It's a winner.
7,11,195,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, thanks."
7,11,195,WOMAN #1,Are you sure you don't wanna go? We have reservations.
7,11,195,ELAINE,"Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble gettin' a table."
7,11,195,WOMAN #1,Ciao.
7,11,195,WOMAN #2,Ba-bye.
7,11,196,THE END,
