7,12,0,THE SEVEN,Written by Alec Berg & Jeff Schaffer
7,12,2,JERRY,"I love it when people are complimented on something they're wearing and they accept the compliment as if it was about them. ""Nice tie."" ""Well, thank you. Thank you very much."" The compliment is for the tie, it's not for you, but we take it. That's kind of the job of clothes; to get compliments for us, because it's very hard to get compliments based on your human qualities. Right? Let's face it, no matter how nice a person you are, nobody's gonna come say ""Hey, nice person."" It's much easier to be a bastard and just try and match the colours up."
7,12,5,ELAINE,"Oh, look at this!"
7,12,5,JERRY,"Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid."
7,12,6,ELAINE,"Oh, cool! Look at that!"
7,12,10,JERRY,"Yeah, I'm right there with ya."
7,12,10,ELAINE,"That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little."
7,12,14,ELAINE,What d'you think Jerry? Jerry?
7,12,14,JERRY,Huh?
7,12,14,ELAINE,What d'you think?
7,12,14,JERRY,"Oh yeah, be great for your paper route."
7,12,14,ELAINE,I love it. I'm getting it.
7,12,15,ELAINE,"Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry."
7,12,15,CHRISTIE,I think your friend needs some help over there.
7,12,15,JERRY,"You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be."
7,12,20,ELAINE,Hey!
7,12,24,SUSAN,A little baby girl?
7,12,24,KEN,Doctor says it could be any day now.
7,12,24,GEORGE,"So, Carrie, you and Susan are"
7,12,26,CARRIE,Doesn't make you anything.
7,12,26,GEORGE,"Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter."
7,12,28,SUSAN,"So, have you picked out a name yet?"
7,12,28,CARRIE,"Well, we've narrowed it down to a few. We like Kimberley."
7,12,28,SUSAN,Aww.
7,12,28,GEORGE,"Hu-ho, boy."
7,12,28,KEN,You don't like Kimberley?
7,12,28,GEORGE,Ech. What else you got?
7,12,28,KEN,How about Joan?
7,12,28,GEORGE,"Aw c'mon, I'm eating here."
7,12,28,SUSAN,George!
7,12,28,CARRIE,Pamela?
7,12,28,GEORGE,"Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people,"
7,12,29,KEN,What?
7,12,29,GEORGE,Soda. S-O-D-A. Soda.
7,12,29,CARRIE,"I don't know, it sounds a little strange."
7,12,29,GEORGE,"All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you"
7,12,30,KEN,"Yeah, but uh... Soda?"
7,12,30,GEORGE,"Yeah, that's right. It's working."
7,12,30,CARRIE,We'll put it on the list.
7,12,30,GEORGE,I solve problems. That's just what I do.
7,12,35,KRAMER,"Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good."
7,12,35,JERRY,You're really going to town with that turkey there.
7,12,35,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, I got a big appetite."
7,12,36,KRAMER,"Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh."
7,12,36,JERRY,It's on the door.
7,12,36,KRAMER,"What, this yellow stuff?"
7,12,38,KRAMER,"Ah, 's no good."
7,12,41,KRAMER,No. That's bush league.
7,12,42,JERRY,"Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there?"
7,12,43,KRAMER,"No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without"
7,12,44,JERRY,"Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your"
7,12,45,KRAMER,"Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy"
7,12,46,JERRY,What arrangement?
7,12,46,KRAMER,"Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I"
7,12,47,JERRY,"Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there"
7,12,50,KRAMER,"Oh, hey."
7,12,50,ELAINE,Hey.
7,12,50,JERRY,Hey. What's with your neck?
7,12,50,ELAINE,Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall.
7,12,51,JERRY,"Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number."
7,12,51,ELAINE,"Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow."
7,12,51,JERRY,"Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it."
7,12,51,ELAINE,"Ach, maybe."
7,12,51,JERRY,Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.
7,12,51,ELAINE,I don't know.
7,12,51,JERRY,Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned
7,12,52,ELAINE,"You know what, why don't you just shut the"
7,12,53,JERRY,Awright.
7,12,53,ELAINE,"God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike"
7,12,54,KRAMER,"Aw, you really hurting, huh?"
7,12,54,ELAINE,"Oh, Kramer, it's just awful."
7,12,54,KRAMER,"Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted."
7,12,55,KRAMER,"Alright, lean forward, relax."
7,12,55,ELAINE,What? What?
7,12,55,KRAMER,Encounter shiatsu.
7,12,56,ELAINE,"Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?"
7,12,56,KRAMER,Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the
7,12,57,ELAINE,Ah hah.
7,12,57,KRAMER,He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.
7,12,57,ELAINE,Wha...?
7,12,57,KRAMER,He's a genius. Here we go...
7,12,60,KRAMER,"From pain, will come pleasure."
7,12,63,KRAMER,Uh? Voila.
7,12,63,ELAINE,Oh my god!
7,12,63,KRAMER,Yeah.
7,12,64,ELAINE,Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!
7,12,64,JERRY,What's even more amazing is his formal training is in
7,12,65,KRAMER,"Awright, my work is done here."
7,12,66,ELAINE,"Oh man! Kramer, thank you!"
7,12,66,KRAMER,"Yeah, you can send that bike over any time."
7,12,66,ELAINE,"What? What, what is he talking about?"
7,12,66,JERRY,"I dunno. Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to"
7,12,67,ELAINE,You really think he wants the bike?
7,12,67,JERRY,Oh yeah.
7,12,67,ELAINE,It took him like ten seconds!
7,12,67,JERRY,"Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months."
7,12,70,GEORGE,I think they really went for that Soda.
7,12,70,SUSAN,"What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring"
7,12,71,GEORGE,"Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda."
7,12,71,SUSAN,"I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda."
7,12,71,GEORGE,"Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A"
7,12,72,SUSAN,Yeah.
7,12,74,SUSAN,What is that? Sign language?
7,12,74,GEORGE,"No, Seven."
7,12,74,SUSAN,Seven Costanza? You're serious?
7,12,74,GEORGE,Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
7,12,75,GEORGE,...especially a girl. Or a boy.
7,12,75,SUSAN,I don't think so.
7,12,75,GEORGE,"What, you don't like the name?"
7,12,75,SUSAN,It's not a name. It's a number.
7,12,75,GEORGE,I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all
7,12,76,SUSAN,It's awful. I hate it!
7,12,76,GEORGE,"Well, that's the name!"
7,12,76,SUSAN,Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to
7,12,77,GEORGE,"Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all"
7,12,81,JERRY,"Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of"
7,12,83,GEORGE,Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name
7,12,85,JERRY,"Awright, let's see. How about Mug? Mug"
7,12,87,GEORGE,"Alright, you having a good time there?"
7,12,89,JERRY,I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik?
7,12,90,GEORGE,"Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me,"
7,12,92,JERRY,"Oh, I forgot to call Christie."
7,12,92,GEORGE,Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?
7,12,92,JERRY,"Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop"
7,12,93,GEORGE,And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do
7,12,94,JERRY,I'm not engaged.
7,12,96,KRAMER,"Ah, I got it."
7,12,96,JERRY,Got what?
7,12,96,KRAMER,"Got the answer, Jerry."
7,12,97,JERRY,"Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want."
7,12,97,KRAMER,"Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I"
7,12,99,KRAMER,"Here. I write it down. ""One cupcake."" And then I"
7,12,101,JERRY,Sort of a mooching inventory.
7,12,101,KRAMER,"No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em"
7,12,102,JERRY,Alright.
7,12,102,KRAMER,"Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When"
7,12,104,JERRY,"Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike."
7,12,104,KRAMER,Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other
7,12,107,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab."
7,12,110,JERRY,"Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the"
7,12,112,MAITRE D',"May I take your coat, miss?"
7,12,112,CHRISTIE,"Yes, thank you."
7,12,118,GEORGE,The same outfit?
7,12,118,JERRY,The exact same outfit.
7,12,118,GEORGE,How many days was it between encounters.
7,12,118,JERRY,Three.
7,12,118,GEORGE,"Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new"
7,12,120,JERRY,"Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at"
7,12,121,GEORGE,Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.
7,12,121,JERRY,"Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?"
7,12,121,GEORGE,Very curious.
7,12,121,JERRY,Indeed.
7,12,121,GEORGE,"You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day."
7,12,121,JERRY,"Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide."
7,12,121,GEORGE,"Awright, I'm heading home."
7,12,121,JERRY,"Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?"
7,12,121,GEORGE,"Not yet, but she's weakening."
7,12,121,JERRY,"You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't"
7,12,122,GEORGE,"It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol."
7,12,122,JERRY,How about 'Mickey'?
7,12,122,GEORGE,'Mickey'? 'Mickey'!
7,12,126,KRAMER,Hey buddy.
7,12,126,JERRY,"Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the"
7,12,127,KRAMER,"No, that's yours. My half is gone."
7,12,127,JERRY,What?
7,12,127,KRAMER,"Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your"
7,12,128,JERRY,You cannot buy half a can of soda.
7,12,128,KRAMER,"Well, why not."
7,12,128,JERRY,"Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation"
7,12,129,KRAMER,Yeah.
7,12,129,JERRY,That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes
7,12,131,JERRY,"...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought"
7,12,133,KRAMER,Alright.
7,12,133,JERRY,"...You bite it, you bought it."
7,12,133,KRAMER,"Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright."
7,12,133,JERRY,Thank you.
7,12,133,KRAMER,Yeah.
7,12,134,ELAINE,Hey.
7,12,134,KRAMER,"Oh. So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?"
7,12,134,ELAINE,"Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even"
7,12,135,KRAMER,It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.
7,12,135,ELAINE,No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like
7,12,137,KRAMER,"Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He"
7,12,138,ELAINE,"This is not the point. The point is, you just can't"
7,12,139,KRAMER,"Boy, I am really surprised at you. You are"
7,12,142,KRAMER,I always put you up here...
7,12,143,KRAMER,...They're over here. Now you're... aww-whawww.
7,12,147,ELAINE,Alright.
7,12,147,KRAMER,Digidi.
7,12,150,GEORGE,"Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody"
7,12,151,SUSAN,"Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more."
7,12,151,GEORGE,Why not?
7,12,151,SUSAN,"Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told"
7,12,152,GEORGE,"So, what're you saying?"
7,12,152,SUSAN,They're gonna name their baby Seven.
7,12,152,GEORGE,"What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name,"
7,12,153,SUSAN,I can't believe that they're using it.
7,12,153,GEORGE,Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose
7,12,154,SUSAN,I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with.
7,12,154,GEORGE,"Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the"
7,12,159,ELAINE,"Oh god! Oh, god. Kramer!"
7,12,163,MAN,Watch your step.
7,12,164,ELAINE,"Oh, ah. Stupid Kramer."
7,12,165,CHRISTIE,Excuse me. Elaine?
7,12,166,ELAINE,Huh?
7,12,168,CHRISTIE,"Over here. I thought that was you. You're Jerry's friend,"
7,12,169,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah. Uh, Christie?"
7,12,169,CHRISTIE,Yes. How y'doing?
7,12,169,ELAINE,I'm fine.
7,12,169,CHRISTIE,"Well, I gotta run. It was good to see you."
7,12,170,ELAINE,"Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you."
7,12,172,VOICE 1,Lookin' good.
7,12,172,VOICE 2,"Hey Cosmo, nice wheels."
7,12,172,KRAMER,You got that right!
7,12,173,KID,"Hey, you're riding a girl's bike."
7,12,174,ELAINE,Kramer! Kramer!
7,12,177,KEN,Hello.
7,12,177,GEORGE,"Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk."
7,12,179,ELAINE,Kramer!
7,12,181,ELAINE,Kramer!!
7,12,181,JERRY,Hey
7,12,182,ELAINE,Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
7,12,183,JERRY,Haven't seen him. How's the neck?
7,12,183,ELAINE,His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was
7,12,186,JERRY,"Boy, I'm surprised. I would think Kramer would have a"
7,12,187,ELAINE,"Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the"
7,12,188,JERRY,You saw her? What was she wearing?
7,12,188,ELAINE,I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of
7,12,189,JERRY,Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?
7,12,189,ELAINE,What d'you care?
7,12,189,JERRY,Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
7,12,192,ELAINE,Did you have a nice ride?
7,12,192,KRAMER,"Oh, great ride."
7,12,192,ELAINE,"Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!"
7,12,195,KRAMER,What're you talking about?! We had a deal!
7,12,195,ELAINE,You better give me back that bike!
7,12,196,KRAMER,Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a
7,12,197,ELAINE,What? You never told me that.
7,12,197,KRAMER,"Well, it's common sense."
7,12,197,ELAINE,"Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous."
7,12,197,KRAMER,"Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should"
7,12,198,ELAINE,Yeah Jerry.
7,12,198,JERRY,"Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but"
7,12,200,ELAINE,"Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?"
7,12,200,KRAMER,"Alright, I'm down."
7,12,200,JERRY,"Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story"
7,12,207,ELAINE,"So, that's the situation."
7,12,207,NEWMAN,Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly
7,12,212,KRAMER,Newman!
7,12,213,NEWMAN,"...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no"
7,12,214,KRAMER,"Uh, yeah."
7,12,214,ELAINE,Yeah.
7,12,214,NEWMAN,"Alright, let's begin."
7,12,216,NEWMAN,"Ooh, my cocoa!"
7,12,220,KEN,Why can't we use Seven?
7,12,220,GEORGE,It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.
7,12,220,CARRIE,"Well, it's not as if Susan's pregnant. You've already postponed"
7,12,221,GEORGE,"Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't"
7,12,222,KEN,"Right, we're both big Mickey Mantle fans, and we love the name."
7,12,223,GEORGE,What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on
7,12,224,KEN,"Well, we don't care for Soda."
7,12,224,GEORGE,You don't care for Soda?!
7,12,224,CARRIE,"No, no. We don't like Soda at all!"
7,12,224,GEORGE,"How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's"
7,12,226,CARRIE,Oh!
7,12,226,KEN,What is it?
7,12,226,CARRIE,I felt something.
7,12,226,KEN,"Are you okay, honey?"
7,12,226,CARRIE,I think I'm going into labour.
7,12,227,KEN,"Oh god, oh god. Okay, let's not panic. Let's just get to the"
7,12,229,CARRIE,Okay.
7,12,229,KEN,"...Alright? I got the suitcase packed, right here."
7,12,231,GEORGE,What about Six?
7,12,232,GEORGE,Nine. Thirt... thirteen's no good.
7,12,233,GEORGE,Fourteen. Fourteen!
7,12,238,CHRISTIE,"Are you okay, Jerry? You seem quiet."
7,12,238,JERRY,"No, I'm just a little uh, worn out."
7,12,238,CHRISTIE,I know exactly what you mean.
7,12,238,JERRY,"Oh, I'm sure you do."
7,12,240,JERRY,What in god's name is going on here? Is she wearing the
7,12,244,CHRISTIE,Oh my god!
7,12,244,JERRY,Oh.
7,12,246,CHRISTIE,Ahh. I can't go to the movies like this. Do you mind if we go
7,12,247,JERRY,"Change? Yes, I think that's a super idea."
7,12,251,CARRIE,Are we almost there?
7,12,251,KEN,"Just keep breathing, okay."
7,12,251,CARRIE,"Okay, okay."
7,12,251,KEN,Okay.
7,12,251,GEORGE,"You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow"
7,12,253,KEN,"Now's not the best time, George!"
7,12,253,GEORGE,"It's just that, I know her, and boy..."
7,12,253,KEN,George! She's in labour!
7,12,253,GEORGE,So am I!
7,12,256,NEWMAN,"Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the"
7,12,258,NEWMAN,"And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for"
7,12,263,NEWMAN,...But I have made a decision. We will cut the
7,12,264,ELAINE,What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!
7,12,266,ELAINE,"Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. Cut the stupid thing"
7,12,267,KRAMER,"No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another"
7,12,268,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, y-yeah."
7,12,268,NEWMAN,"Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather"
7,12,269,ELAINE,What?!
7,12,269,KRAMER,"Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise."
7,12,270,ELAINE,"But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still"
7,12,272,KRAMER,"Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride."
7,12,276,CHRISTIE,Here we are.
7,12,276,JERRY,"Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude."
7,12,277,CHRISTIE,"Well, I guess I'll go change."
7,12,277,JERRY,"Yes, change. By all means, change."
7,12,282,JERRY,"August seventeen, nineteen-ninety-two. The same dress!"
7,12,286,JERRY,There must be a secret stash around here somewhere.
7,12,289,CHRISTIE,Ahem! Are you looking for something?
7,12,289,JERRY,What're you doing? I thought you were changing.
7,12,289,CHRISTIE,"No, I, I'm thinking we should just call it a night."
7,12,289,JERRY,"No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out."
7,12,289,CHRISTIE,"If it's all the same to you, I think I'm just gonna go to"

7,12,375,CHRISTIE,I think your friend needs some help over there.
7,12,375,JERRY,"You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be."
7,12,380,ELAINE,Hey!
7,12,384,SUSAN,A little baby girl?
7,12,384,KEN,Doctor says it could be any day now.
7,12,384,GEORGE,"So, Carrie, you and Susan are"
7,12,386,CARRIE,Doesn't make you anything.
7,12,386,GEORGE,"Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter."
7,12,388,SUSAN,"So, have you picked out a name yet?"
7,12,388,CARRIE,"Well, we've narrowed it down to a few. We like Kimberley."
7,12,388,SUSAN,Aww.

7,12,395,KRAMER,"Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good."
7,12,395,JERRY,You're really going to town with that turkey there.
7,12,395,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, I got a big appetite."
7,12,396,KRAMER,"Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh."

7,12,410,ELAINE,Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall.
7,12,411,JERRY,"Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number."
7,12,411,ELAINE,"Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow."
7,12,411,JERRY,"Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it."
7,12,411,ELAINE,"Ach, maybe."
7,12,411,JERRY,Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.
7,12,411,ELAINE,I don't know.
7,12,411,JERRY,Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned
7,12,412,ELAINE,"You know what, why don't you just shut the"
7,12,413,JERRY,Awright.
7,12,413,ELAINE,"God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike"
7,12,414,KRAMER,"Aw, you really hurting, huh?"
7,12,414,ELAINE,"Oh, Kramer, it's just awful."
7,12,414,KRAMER,"Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted."
7,12,415,KRAMER,"Alright, lean forward, relax."
7,12,415,ELAINE,What? What?
7,12,415,KRAMER,Encounter shiatsu.
7,12,416,ELAINE,"Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?"
7,12,416,KRAMER,Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the
7,12,417,ELAINE,Ah hah.
7,12,417,KRAMER,He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.
7,12,417,ELAINE,Wha...?
7,12,417,KRAMER,He's a genius. Here we go...
7,12,420,KRAMER,"From pain, will come pleasure."
7,12,423,KRAMER,Uh? Voila.
7,12,423,ELAINE,Oh my god!
7,12,423,KRAMER,Yeah.
7,12,424,ELAINE,Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!
7,12,424,JERRY,What's even more amazing is his formal training is in
7,12,425,KRAMER,"Awright, my work is done here."
7,12,426,ELAINE,"Oh man! Kramer, thank you!"
7,12,426,KRAMER,"Yeah, you can send that bike over any time."
7,12,426,ELAINE,"What? What, what is he talking about?"
7,12,426,JERRY,"I dunno. Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to"
7,12,427,ELAINE,You really think he wants the bike?
7,12,427,JERRY,Oh yeah.
7,12,427,ELAINE,It took him like ten seconds!
7,12,427,JERRY,"Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months."
7,12,430,GEORGE,I think they really went for that Soda.
7,12,430,SUSAN,"What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring"
7,12,431,GEORGE,"Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda."
7,12,431,SUSAN,"I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda."
7,12,431,GEORGE,"Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A"
7,12,432,SUSAN,Yeah.
7,12,434,SUSAN,What is that? Sign language?
7,12,434,GEORGE,"No, Seven."
7,12,434,SUSAN,Seven Costanza? You're serious?
7,12,434,GEORGE,Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
7,12,435,GEORGE,...especially a girl. Or a boy.
7,12,435,SUSAN,I don't think so.
7,12,435,GEORGE,"What, you don't like the name?"
7,12,435,SUSAN,It's not a name. It's a number.
7,12,435,GEORGE,I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all
7,12,436,SUSAN,It's awful. I hate it!
7,12,436,GEORGE,"Well, that's the name!"
7,12,436,SUSAN,Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to
7,12,437,GEORGE,"Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all"
7,12,441,JERRY,"Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of"
7,12,443,GEORGE,Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name
7,12,445,JERRY,"Awright, let's see. How about Mug? Mug"
7,12,447,GEORGE,"Alright, you having a good time there?"
7,12,449,JERRY,I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik?
7,12,450,GEORGE,"Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me,"
7,12,452,JERRY,"Oh, I forgot to call Christie."
7,12,452,GEORGE,Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?
7,12,452,JERRY,"Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop"
7,12,453,GEORGE,And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do
7,12,454,JERRY,I'm not engaged.
7,12,456,KRAMER,"Ah, I got it."
7,12,456,JERRY,Got what?
7,12,456,KRAMER,"Got the answer, Jerry."
7,12,457,JERRY,"Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want."
7,12,457,KRAMER,"Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I"
7,12,459,KRAMER,"Here. I write it down. ""One cupcake."" And then I"
7,12,461,JERRY,Sort of a mooching inventory.
7,12,461,KRAMER,"No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em"
7,12,462,JERRY,Alright.
7,12,462,KRAMER,"Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When"
7,12,464,JERRY,"Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike."
7,12,464,KRAMER,Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other
7,12,467,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab."
7,12,470,JERRY,"Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the"
7,12,472,MAITRE D',"May I take your coat, miss?"
7,12,472,CHRISTIE,"Yes, thank you."
7,12,478,GEORGE,The same outfit?
7,12,478,JERRY,The exact same outfit.
7,12,478,GEORGE,How many days was it between encounters.
7,12,478,JERRY,Three.
7,12,478,GEORGE,"Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new"
7,12,480,JERRY,"Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at"
7,12,481,GEORGE,Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.
7,12,481,JERRY,"Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?"
7,12,481,GEORGE,Very curious.
7,12,481,JERRY,Indeed.
7,12,481,GEORGE,"You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day."
7,12,481,JERRY,"Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide."
7,12,481,GEORGE,"Awright, I'm heading home."
7,12,481,JERRY,"Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?"
7,12,481,GEORGE,"Not yet, but she's weakening."
7,12,481,JERRY,"You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't"
7,12,482,GEORGE,"It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol."
7,12,482,JERRY,How about 'Mickey'?
7,12,482,GEORGE,'Mickey'? 'Mickey'!
7,12,486,KRAMER,Hey buddy.
7,12,486,JERRY,"Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the"
7,12,487,KRAMER,"No, that's yours. My half is gone."
7,12,487,JERRY,What?
7,12,487,KRAMER,"Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your"
7,12,488,JERRY,You cannot buy half a can of soda.
7,12,488,KRAMER,"Well, why not."
7,12,488,JERRY,"Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation"
7,12,489,KRAMER,Yeah.
7,12,489,JERRY,That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes
7,12,491,JERRY,"...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought"
7,12,493,KRAMER,Alright.
7,12,493,JERRY,"...You bite it, you bought it."
7,12,493,KRAMER,"Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright."
7,12,493,JERRY,Thank you.
7,12,493,KRAMER,Yeah.
7,12,494,ELAINE,Hey.
7,12,494,KRAMER,"Oh. So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?"
7,12,494,ELAINE,"Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even"
7,12,495,KRAMER,It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.
7,12,495,ELAINE,No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like
7,12,497,KRAMER,"Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He"
7,12,498,ELAINE,"This is not the point. The point is, you just can't"
7,12,499,KRAMER,"Boy, I am really surprised at you. You are"
7,12,502,KRAMER,I always put you up here...
7,12,503,KRAMER,...They're over here. Now you're... aww-whawww.
7,12,507,ELAINE,Alright.
7,12,507,KRAMER,Digidi.
7,12,510,GEORGE,"Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody"
7,12,511,SUSAN,"Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more."
7,12,511,GEORGE,Why not?
7,12,511,SUSAN,"Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told"
7,12,512,GEORGE,"So, what're you saying?"
7,12,512,SUSAN,They're gonna name their baby Seven.
7,12,512,GEORGE,"What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name,"
7,12,513,SUSAN,I can't believe that they're using it.
7,12,513,GEORGE,Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose
7,12,514,SUSAN,I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with.
7,12,514,GEORGE,"Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the"
7,12,519,ELAINE,"Oh god! Oh, god. Kramer!"
7,12,523,MAN,Watch your step.
7,12,524,ELAINE,"Oh, ah. Stupid Kramer."
7,12,525,CHRISTIE,Excuse me. Elaine?
7,12,526,ELAINE,Huh?
7,12,528,CHRISTIE,"Over here. I thought that was you. You're Jerry's friend,"
7,12,529,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah. Uh, Christie?"
7,12,529,CHRISTIE,Yes. How y'doing?
7,12,529,ELAINE,I'm fine.
7,12,529,CHRISTIE,"Well, I gotta run. It was good to see you."

7,12,532,VOICE 1,Lookin' good.
7,12,532,VOICE 2,"Hey Cosmo, nice wheels."
7,12,532,KRAMER,You got that right!
7,12,533,KID,"Hey, you're riding a girl's bike."
7,12,534,ELAINE,Kramer! Kramer!
7,12,537,KEN,Hello.
7,12,537,GEORGE,"Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk."
7,12,539,ELAINE,Kramer!
7,12,541,ELAINE,Kramer!!
7,12,541,JERRY,Hey
7,12,542,ELAINE,Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
7,12,543,JERRY,Haven't seen him. How's the neck?
7,12,543,ELAINE,His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was
7,12,546,JERRY,"Boy, I'm surprised. I would think Kramer would have a"
7,12,547,ELAINE,"Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the"
7,12,548,JERRY,You saw her? What was she wearing?
7,12,548,ELAINE,I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of
7,12,549,JERRY,Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?
7,12,549,ELAINE,What d'you care?
7,12,549,JERRY,Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
7,12,552,ELAINE,Did you have a nice ride?
7,12,552,KRAMER,"Oh, great ride."
7,12,552,ELAINE,"Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!"
7,12,555,KRAMER,What're you talking about?! We had a deal!
7,12,555,ELAINE,You better give me back that bike!
7,12,556,KRAMER,Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a
7,12,557,ELAINE,What? You never told me that.
7,12,557,KRAMER,"Well, it's common sense."
7,12,557,ELAINE,"Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous."
7,12,557,KRAMER,"Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should"
7,12,558,ELAINE,Yeah Jerry.
7,12,558,JERRY,"Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but"
7,12,560,ELAINE,"Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?"
7,12,560,KRAMER,"Alright, I'm down."
7,12,560,JERRY,"Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story"
7,12,567,ELAINE,"So, that's the situation."
7,12,567,NEWMAN,Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly
7,12,572,KRAMER,Newman!
7,12,573,NEWMAN,"...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no"
7,12,574,KRAMER,"Uh, yeah."
7,12,574,ELAINE,Yeah.
7,12,574,NEWMAN,"Alright, let's begin."
7,12,576,NEWMAN,"Ooh, my cocoa!"
7,12,580,KEN,Why can't we use Seven?
7,12,580,GEORGE,It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.
7,12,580,CARRIE,"Well, it's not as if Susan's pregnant. You've already postponed"
7,12,581,GEORGE,"Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't"
7,12,582,KEN,"Right, we're both big Mickey Mantle fans, and we love the name."
7,12,583,GEORGE,What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on
7,12,584,KEN,"Well, we don't care for Soda."
7,12,584,GEORGE,You don't care for Soda?!
7,12,584,CARRIE,"No, no. We don't like Soda at all!"
7,12,584,GEORGE,"How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's"
7,12,586,CARRIE,Oh!
7,12,586,KEN,What is it?
7,12,586,CARRIE,I felt something.
7,12,586,KEN,"Are you okay, honey?"
7,12,586,CARRIE,I think I'm going into labour.
7,12,587,KEN,"Oh god, oh god. Okay, let's not panic. Let's just get to the"
7,12,589,CARRIE,Okay.

7,12,598,JERRY,"Oh, I'm sure you do."
7,12,600,JERRY,What in god's name is going on here? Is she wearing the

7,12,604,JERRY,Oh.
7,12,606,CHRISTIE,Ahh. I can't go to the movies like this. Do you mind if we go
7,12,607,JERRY,"Change? Yes, I think that's a super idea."
7,12,611,CARRIE,Are we almost there?
7,12,611,KEN,"Just keep breathing, okay."
7,12,611,CARRIE,"Okay, okay."
7,12,611,KEN,Okay.

7,12,613,GEORGE,"It's just that, I know her, and boy..."
7,12,613,KEN,George! She's in labour!
7,12,613,GEORGE,So am I!
7,12,616,NEWMAN,"Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the"
7,12,618,NEWMAN,"And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for"
7,12,623,NEWMAN,...But I have made a decision. We will cut the
7,12,624,ELAINE,What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!
7,12,626,ELAINE,"Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. Cut the stupid thing"
7,12,627,KRAMER,"No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another"
7,12,628,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, y-yeah."
7,12,628,NEWMAN,"Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather"
7,12,629,ELAINE,What?!
7,12,629,KRAMER,"Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise."
7,12,630,ELAINE,"But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still"
7,12,632,KRAMER,"Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride."

7,12,636,JERRY,"Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude."
7,12,637,CHRISTIE,"Well, I guess I'll go change."
7,12,637,JERRY,"Yes, change. By all means, change."
7,12,642,JERRY,"August seventeen, nineteen-ninety-two. The same dress!"
7,12,646,JERRY,There must be a secret stash around here somewhere.
7,12,649,CHRISTIE,Ahem! Are you looking for something?
7,12,649,JERRY,What're you doing? I thought you were changing.
7,12,649,CHRISTIE,"No, I, I'm thinking we should just call it a night."
7,12,649,JERRY,"No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out."
7,12,649,CHRISTIE,"If it's all the same to you, I think I'm just gonna go to"
7,12,651,JERRY,"You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on"
7,12,655,CHRISTIE,Jerry. I don't think so.
7,12,656,JERRY,You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?
7,12,656,CHRISTIE,Get out.
7,12,658,JERRY,Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you

7,12,675,JERRY,"Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again?"
7,12,680,KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry, if you're gonna be snacking"
7,12,681,JERRY,"Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little"
7,12,684,KRAMER,Yikes.

7,12,684,KRAMER,"Well, I don't have this kind of cash."
7,12,684,JERRY,Few do.
7,12,684,KRAMER,I'm good for it.
7,12,684,JERRY,"Yeah, well, until this bill is paid..."
7,12,685,JERRY,...the food court is closed.

7,12,734,ELAINE,I love it. I'm getting it.
7,12,735,ELAINE,"Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry."
7,12,735,CHRISTIE,I think your friend needs some help over there.
7,12,735,JERRY,"You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be."
7,12,740,ELAINE,Hey!
7,12,744,SUSAN,A little baby girl?
7,12,744,KEN,Doctor says it could be any day now.
7,12,744,GEORGE,"So, Carrie, you and Susan are"
7,12,746,CARRIE,Doesn't make you anything.
7,12,746,GEORGE,"Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter."
7,12,748,SUSAN,"So, have you picked out a name yet?"
7,12,748,CARRIE,"Well, we've narrowed it down to a few. We like Kimberley."
7,12,748,SUSAN,Aww.
7,12,748,GEORGE,"Hu-ho, boy."
7,12,748,KEN,You don't like Kimberley?
7,12,748,GEORGE,Ech. What else you got?
7,12,748,KEN,How about Joan?

7,12,749,GEORGE,Soda. S-O-D-A. Soda.
7,12,749,CARRIE,"I don't know, it sounds a little strange."
7,12,749,GEORGE,"All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you"
7,12,750,KEN,"Yeah, but uh... Soda?"
7,12,750,GEORGE,"Yeah, that's right. It's working."
7,12,750,CARRIE,We'll put it on the list.
7,12,750,GEORGE,I solve problems. That's just what I do.
7,12,755,KRAMER,"Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good."
7,12,755,JERRY,You're really going to town with that turkey there.
7,12,755,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, I got a big appetite."
7,12,756,KRAMER,"Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh."
7,12,756,JERRY,It's on the door.
7,12,756,KRAMER,"What, this yellow stuff?"
7,12,758,KRAMER,"Ah, 's no good."
7,12,761,KRAMER,No. That's bush league.
7,12,762,JERRY,"Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there?"
7,12,763,KRAMER,"No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without"
7,12,764,JERRY,"Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your"
7,12,765,KRAMER,"Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy"
7,12,766,JERRY,What arrangement?
7,12,766,KRAMER,"Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I"

7,12,770,ELAINE,Hey.
7,12,770,JERRY,Hey. What's with your neck?
7,12,770,ELAINE,Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall.
7,12,771,JERRY,"Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number."
7,12,771,ELAINE,"Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow."
7,12,771,JERRY,"Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it."
7,12,771,ELAINE,"Ach, maybe."
7,12,771,JERRY,Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.
7,12,771,ELAINE,I don't know.
7,12,771,JERRY,Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned
7,12,772,ELAINE,"You know what, why don't you just shut the"
7,12,773,JERRY,Awright.
7,12,773,ELAINE,"God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike"
7,12,774,KRAMER,"Aw, you really hurting, huh?"
7,12,774,ELAINE,"Oh, Kramer, it's just awful."
7,12,774,KRAMER,"Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted."
7,12,775,KRAMER,"Alright, lean forward, relax."
7,12,775,ELAINE,What? What?
7,12,775,KRAMER,Encounter shiatsu.
7,12,776,ELAINE,"Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?"
7,12,776,KRAMER,Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the
7,12,777,ELAINE,Ah hah.
7,12,777,KRAMER,He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.
7,12,777,ELAINE,Wha...?
7,12,777,KRAMER,He's a genius. Here we go...
7,12,780,KRAMER,"From pain, will come pleasure."
7,12,783,KRAMER,Uh? Voila.
7,12,783,ELAINE,Oh my god!
7,12,783,KRAMER,Yeah.
7,12,784,ELAINE,Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!
7,12,784,JERRY,What's even more amazing is his formal training is in
7,12,785,KRAMER,"Awright, my work is done here."
7,12,786,ELAINE,"Oh man! Kramer, thank you!"
7,12,786,KRAMER,"Yeah, you can send that bike over any time."
7,12,786,ELAINE,"What? What, what is he talking about?"
7,12,786,JERRY,"I dunno. Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to"
7,12,787,ELAINE,You really think he wants the bike?
7,12,787,JERRY,Oh yeah.
7,12,787,ELAINE,It took him like ten seconds!
7,12,787,JERRY,"Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months."
7,12,790,GEORGE,I think they really went for that Soda.
7,12,790,SUSAN,"What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring"
7,12,791,GEORGE,"Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda."
7,12,791,SUSAN,"I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda."
7,12,791,GEORGE,"Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A"
7,12,792,SUSAN,Yeah.
7,12,794,SUSAN,What is that? Sign language?
7,12,794,GEORGE,"No, Seven."
7,12,794,SUSAN,Seven Costanza? You're serious?
7,12,794,GEORGE,Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
7,12,795,GEORGE,...especially a girl. Or a boy.
7,12,795,SUSAN,I don't think so.
7,12,795,GEORGE,"What, you don't like the name?"
7,12,795,SUSAN,It's not a name. It's a number.
7,12,795,GEORGE,I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all
7,12,796,SUSAN,It's awful. I hate it!
7,12,796,GEORGE,"Well, that's the name!"
7,12,796,SUSAN,Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to
7,12,797,GEORGE,"Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all"
7,12,801,JERRY,"Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of"
7,12,803,GEORGE,Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name
7,12,805,JERRY,"Awright, let's see. How about Mug? Mug"
7,12,807,GEORGE,"Alright, you having a good time there?"
7,12,809,JERRY,I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik?
7,12,810,GEORGE,"Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me,"
7,12,812,JERRY,"Oh, I forgot to call Christie."
7,12,812,GEORGE,Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?
7,12,812,JERRY,"Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop"
7,12,813,GEORGE,And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do
7,12,814,JERRY,I'm not engaged.
7,12,816,KRAMER,"Ah, I got it."
7,12,816,JERRY,Got what?
7,12,816,KRAMER,"Got the answer, Jerry."
7,12,817,JERRY,"Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want."
7,12,817,KRAMER,"Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I"
7,12,819,KRAMER,"Here. I write it down. ""One cupcake."" And then I"
7,12,821,JERRY,Sort of a mooching inventory.
7,12,821,KRAMER,"No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em"
7,12,822,JERRY,Alright.
7,12,822,KRAMER,"Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When"
7,12,824,JERRY,"Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike."
7,12,824,KRAMER,Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other
7,12,827,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab."
7,12,830,JERRY,"Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the"
7,12,832,MAITRE D',"May I take your coat, miss?"
7,12,832,CHRISTIE,"Yes, thank you."
7,12,838,GEORGE,The same outfit?
7,12,838,JERRY,The exact same outfit.
7,12,838,GEORGE,How many days was it between encounters.
7,12,838,JERRY,Three.
7,12,838,GEORGE,"Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new"
7,12,840,JERRY,"Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at"
7,12,841,GEORGE,Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.
7,12,841,JERRY,"Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?"
7,12,841,GEORGE,Very curious.
7,12,841,JERRY,Indeed.
7,12,841,GEORGE,"You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day."
7,12,841,JERRY,"Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide."
7,12,841,GEORGE,"Awright, I'm heading home."
7,12,841,JERRY,"Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?"
7,12,841,GEORGE,"Not yet, but she's weakening."
7,12,841,JERRY,"You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't"
7,12,842,GEORGE,"It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol."
7,12,842,JERRY,How about 'Mickey'?
7,12,842,GEORGE,'Mickey'? 'Mickey'!
7,12,846,KRAMER,Hey buddy.
7,12,846,JERRY,"Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the"
7,12,847,KRAMER,"No, that's yours. My half is gone."
7,12,847,JERRY,What?
7,12,847,KRAMER,"Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your"
7,12,848,JERRY,You cannot buy half a can of soda.
7,12,848,KRAMER,"Well, why not."
7,12,848,JERRY,"Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation"
7,12,849,KRAMER,Yeah.
7,12,849,JERRY,That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes
7,12,851,JERRY,"...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought"
7,12,853,KRAMER,Alright.
7,12,853,JERRY,"...You bite it, you bought it."
7,12,853,KRAMER,"Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright."
7,12,853,JERRY,Thank you.
7,12,853,KRAMER,Yeah.
7,12,854,ELAINE,Hey.
7,12,854,KRAMER,"Oh. So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?"
7,12,854,ELAINE,"Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even"
7,12,855,KRAMER,It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.
7,12,855,ELAINE,No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like
7,12,857,KRAMER,"Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He"
7,12,858,ELAINE,"This is not the point. The point is, you just can't"
7,12,859,KRAMER,"Boy, I am really surprised at you. You are"
7,12,862,KRAMER,I always put you up here...
7,12,863,KRAMER,...They're over here. Now you're... aww-whawww.
7,12,867,ELAINE,Alright.
7,12,867,KRAMER,Digidi.
7,12,870,GEORGE,"Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody"
7,12,871,SUSAN,"Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more."
7,12,871,GEORGE,Why not?
7,12,871,SUSAN,"Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told"
7,12,872,GEORGE,"So, what're you saying?"
7,12,872,SUSAN,They're gonna name their baby Seven.
7,12,872,GEORGE,"What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name,"
7,12,873,SUSAN,I can't believe that they're using it.
7,12,873,GEORGE,Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose
7,12,874,SUSAN,I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with.
7,12,874,GEORGE,"Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the"
7,12,879,ELAINE,"Oh god! Oh, god. Kramer!"
7,12,883,MAN,Watch your step.
7,12,884,ELAINE,"Oh, ah. Stupid Kramer."
7,12,885,CHRISTIE,Excuse me. Elaine?
7,12,886,ELAINE,Huh?
7,12,888,CHRISTIE,"Over here. I thought that was you. You're Jerry's friend,"
7,12,889,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah. Uh, Christie?"
7,12,889,CHRISTIE,Yes. How y'doing?
7,12,889,ELAINE,I'm fine.
7,12,889,CHRISTIE,"Well, I gotta run. It was good to see you."
7,12,890,ELAINE,"Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you."
7,12,892,VOICE 1,Lookin' good.
7,12,892,VOICE 2,"Hey Cosmo, nice wheels."
7,12,892,KRAMER,You got that right!
7,12,893,KID,"Hey, you're riding a girl's bike."
7,12,894,ELAINE,Kramer! Kramer!
7,12,897,KEN,Hello.
7,12,897,GEORGE,"Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk."
7,12,899,ELAINE,Kramer!
7,12,901,ELAINE,Kramer!!
7,12,901,JERRY,Hey
7,12,902,ELAINE,Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
7,12,903,JERRY,Haven't seen him. How's the neck?
7,12,903,ELAINE,His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was
7,12,906,JERRY,"Boy, I'm surprised. I would think Kramer would have a"
7,12,907,ELAINE,"Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the"
7,12,908,JERRY,You saw her? What was she wearing?
7,12,908,ELAINE,I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of
7,12,909,JERRY,Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?
7,12,909,ELAINE,What d'you care?
7,12,909,JERRY,Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
7,12,912,ELAINE,Did you have a nice ride?
7,12,912,KRAMER,"Oh, great ride."
7,12,912,ELAINE,"Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!"
7,12,915,KRAMER,What're you talking about?! We had a deal!
7,12,915,ELAINE,You better give me back that bike!
7,12,916,KRAMER,Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a
7,12,917,ELAINE,What? You never told me that.
7,12,917,KRAMER,"Well, it's common sense."
7,12,917,ELAINE,"Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous."
7,12,917,KRAMER,"Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should"
7,12,918,ELAINE,Yeah Jerry.
7,12,918,JERRY,"Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but"
7,12,920,ELAINE,"Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?"
7,12,920,KRAMER,"Alright, I'm down."
7,12,920,JERRY,"Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story"
7,12,927,ELAINE,"So, that's the situation."
7,12,927,NEWMAN,Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly
7,12,932,KRAMER,Newman!
7,12,933,NEWMAN,"...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no"
7,12,934,KRAMER,"Uh, yeah."
7,12,934,ELAINE,Yeah.
7,12,934,NEWMAN,"Alright, let's begin."
7,12,936,NEWMAN,"Ooh, my cocoa!"
7,12,940,KEN,Why can't we use Seven?
7,12,940,GEORGE,It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.
7,12,940,CARRIE,"Well, it's not as if Susan's pregnant. You've already postponed"

7,12,942,KEN,"Right, we're both big Mickey Mantle fans, and we love the name."
7,12,943,GEORGE,What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on
7,12,944,KEN,"Well, we don't care for Soda."
7,12,944,GEORGE,You don't care for Soda?!
7,12,944,CARRIE,"No, no. We don't like Soda at all!"

7,12,946,CARRIE,I felt something.
7,12,946,KEN,"Are you okay, honey?"
7,12,946,CARRIE,I think I'm going into labour.
7,12,947,KEN,"Oh god, oh god. Okay, let's not panic. Let's just get to the"

7,12,958,CHRISTIE,"Are you okay, Jerry? You seem quiet."
7,12,958,JERRY,"No, I'm just a little uh, worn out."
7,12,958,CHRISTIE,I know exactly what you mean.
7,12,958,JERRY,"Oh, I'm sure you do."
7,12,960,JERRY,What in god's name is going on here? Is she wearing the
7,12,964,CHRISTIE,Oh my god!
7,12,964,JERRY,Oh.
7,12,966,CHRISTIE,Ahh. I can't go to the movies like this. Do you mind if we go
7,12,967,JERRY,"Change? Yes, I think that's a super idea."
7,12,971,CARRIE,Are we almost there?
7,12,971,KEN,"Just keep breathing, okay."
7,12,971,CARRIE,"Okay, okay."
7,12,971,KEN,Okay.
7,12,971,GEORGE,"You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow"
7,12,973,KEN,"Now's not the best time, George!"
7,12,973,GEORGE,"It's just that, I know her, and boy..."
7,12,973,KEN,George! She's in labour!
7,12,973,GEORGE,So am I!

7,12,978,NEWMAN,"And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for"
7,12,983,NEWMAN,...But I have made a decision. We will cut the
7,12,984,ELAINE,What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!
7,12,986,ELAINE,"Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. Cut the stupid thing"
7,12,987,KRAMER,"No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another"
7,12,988,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, y-yeah."
7,12,988,NEWMAN,"Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather"
7,12,989,ELAINE,What?!
7,12,989,KRAMER,"Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise."
7,12,990,ELAINE,"But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still"
7,12,992,KRAMER,"Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride."
7,12,996,CHRISTIE,Here we are.
7,12,996,JERRY,"Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude."
7,12,997,CHRISTIE,"Well, I guess I'll go change."
7,12,997,JERRY,"Yes, change. By all means, change."
7,12,1002,JERRY,"August seventeen, nineteen-ninety-two. The same dress!"
7,12,1006,JERRY,There must be a secret stash around here somewhere.
7,12,1009,CHRISTIE,Ahem! Are you looking for something?
7,12,1009,JERRY,What're you doing? I thought you were changing.
7,12,1009,CHRISTIE,"No, I, I'm thinking we should just call it a night."
7,12,1009,JERRY,"No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out."
7,12,1009,CHRISTIE,"If it's all the same to you, I think I'm just gonna go to"
7,12,1011,JERRY,"You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on"
7,12,1015,CHRISTIE,Jerry. I don't think so.
7,12,1016,JERRY,You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?
7,12,1016,CHRISTIE,Get out.
7,12,1018,JERRY,Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you

7,12,1041,JERRY,"Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little"
7,12,1044,KRAMER,Yikes.

7,12,1044,KRAMER,"Well, I don't have this kind of cash."
7,12,1044,JERRY,Few do.
7,12,1044,KRAMER,I'm good for it.
7,12,1044,JERRY,"Yeah, well, until this bill is paid..."
7,12,1045,JERRY,...the food court is closed.

7,12,1095,CHRISTIE,I think your friend needs some help over there.
7,12,1095,JERRY,"You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be."
7,12,1100,ELAINE,Hey!
7,12,1104,SUSAN,A little baby girl?

7,12,1106,CARRIE,Doesn't make you anything.
7,12,1106,GEORGE,"Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter."
7,12,1108,SUSAN,"So, have you picked out a name yet?"
7,12,1108,CARRIE,"Well, we've narrowed it down to a few. We like Kimberley."

7,12,1115,KRAMER,"Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good."
7,12,1115,JERRY,You're really going to town with that turkey there.
7,12,1115,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, I got a big appetite."
7,12,1116,KRAMER,"Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh."
7,12,1116,JERRY,It's on the door.

7,12,1122,JERRY,"Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there?"
7,12,1123,KRAMER,"No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without"

7,12,1130,ELAINE,Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall.
7,12,1131,JERRY,"Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number."
7,12,1131,ELAINE,"Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow."
7,12,1131,JERRY,"Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it."
7,12,1131,ELAINE,"Ach, maybe."
7,12,1131,JERRY,Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.
7,12,1131,ELAINE,I don't know.
7,12,1131,JERRY,Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned
7,12,1132,ELAINE,"You know what, why don't you just shut the"
7,12,1133,JERRY,Awright.
7,12,1133,ELAINE,"God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike"
7,12,1134,KRAMER,"Aw, you really hurting, huh?"
7,12,1134,ELAINE,"Oh, Kramer, it's just awful."
7,12,1134,KRAMER,"Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted."

7,12,1135,ELAINE,What? What?
7,12,1135,KRAMER,Encounter shiatsu.
7,12,1136,ELAINE,"Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?"
7,12,1136,KRAMER,Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the
7,12,1137,ELAINE,Ah hah.
7,12,1137,KRAMER,He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.
7,12,1137,ELAINE,Wha...?
7,12,1137,KRAMER,He's a genius. Here we go...
7,12,1140,KRAMER,"From pain, will come pleasure."
7,12,1143,KRAMER,Uh? Voila.
7,12,1143,ELAINE,Oh my god!
7,12,1143,KRAMER,Yeah.
7,12,1144,ELAINE,Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!
7,12,1144,JERRY,What's even more amazing is his formal training is in

7,12,1146,ELAINE,"Oh man! Kramer, thank you!"
7,12,1146,KRAMER,"Yeah, you can send that bike over any time."
7,12,1146,ELAINE,"What? What, what is he talking about?"
7,12,1146,JERRY,"I dunno. Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to"
7,12,1147,ELAINE,You really think he wants the bike?
7,12,1147,JERRY,Oh yeah.
7,12,1147,ELAINE,It took him like ten seconds!
7,12,1147,JERRY,"Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months."
7,12,1150,GEORGE,I think they really went for that Soda.
7,12,1150,SUSAN,"What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring"
7,12,1151,GEORGE,"Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda."
7,12,1151,SUSAN,"I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda."
7,12,1151,GEORGE,"Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A"
7,12,1152,SUSAN,Yeah.
7,12,1154,SUSAN,What is that? Sign language?
7,12,1154,GEORGE,"No, Seven."
7,12,1154,SUSAN,Seven Costanza? You're serious?
7,12,1154,GEORGE,Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
7,12,1155,GEORGE,...especially a girl. Or a boy.
7,12,1155,SUSAN,I don't think so.
7,12,1155,GEORGE,"What, you don't like the name?"
7,12,1155,SUSAN,It's not a name. It's a number.
7,12,1155,GEORGE,I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all
7,12,1156,SUSAN,It's awful. I hate it!
7,12,1156,GEORGE,"Well, that's the name!"
7,12,1156,SUSAN,Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to
7,12,1157,GEORGE,"Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all"
7,12,1161,JERRY,"Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of"
7,12,1163,GEORGE,Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name
7,12,1165,JERRY,"Awright, let's see. How about Mug? Mug"
7,12,1167,GEORGE,"Alright, you having a good time there?"
7,12,1169,JERRY,I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik?
7,12,1170,GEORGE,"Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me,"
7,12,1172,JERRY,"Oh, I forgot to call Christie."
7,12,1172,GEORGE,Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?
7,12,1172,JERRY,"Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop"
7,12,1173,GEORGE,And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do
7,12,1174,JERRY,I'm not engaged.
7,12,1176,KRAMER,"Ah, I got it."
7,12,1176,JERRY,Got what?
7,12,1176,KRAMER,"Got the answer, Jerry."
7,12,1177,JERRY,"Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want."
7,12,1177,KRAMER,"Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I"
7,12,1179,KRAMER,"Here. I write it down. ""One cupcake."" And then I"
7,12,1181,JERRY,Sort of a mooching inventory.
7,12,1181,KRAMER,"No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em"
7,12,1182,JERRY,Alright.
7,12,1182,KRAMER,"Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When"
7,12,1184,JERRY,"Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike."
7,12,1184,KRAMER,Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other
7,12,1187,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab."
7,12,1190,JERRY,"Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the"
7,12,1192,MAITRE D',"May I take your coat, miss?"
7,12,1192,CHRISTIE,"Yes, thank you."
7,12,1198,GEORGE,The same outfit?
7,12,1198,JERRY,The exact same outfit.
7,12,1198,GEORGE,How many days was it between encounters.
7,12,1198,JERRY,Three.
7,12,1198,GEORGE,"Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new"
7,12,1200,JERRY,"Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at"
7,12,1201,GEORGE,Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.
7,12,1201,JERRY,"Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?"
7,12,1201,GEORGE,Very curious.
7,12,1201,JERRY,Indeed.
7,12,1201,GEORGE,"You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day."
7,12,1201,JERRY,"Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide."
7,12,1201,GEORGE,"Awright, I'm heading home."
7,12,1201,JERRY,"Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?"
7,12,1201,GEORGE,"Not yet, but she's weakening."
7,12,1201,JERRY,"You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't"
7,12,1202,GEORGE,"It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol."
7,12,1202,JERRY,How about 'Mickey'?
7,12,1202,GEORGE,'Mickey'? 'Mickey'!
7,12,1206,KRAMER,Hey buddy.
7,12,1206,JERRY,"Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the"
7,12,1207,KRAMER,"No, that's yours. My half is gone."
7,12,1207,JERRY,What?
7,12,1207,KRAMER,"Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your"
7,12,1208,JERRY,You cannot buy half a can of soda.
7,12,1208,KRAMER,"Well, why not."
7,12,1208,JERRY,"Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation"
7,12,1209,KRAMER,Yeah.
7,12,1209,JERRY,That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes
7,12,1211,JERRY,"...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought"
7,12,1213,KRAMER,Alright.
7,12,1213,JERRY,"...You bite it, you bought it."
7,12,1213,KRAMER,"Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright."
7,12,1213,JERRY,Thank you.
7,12,1213,KRAMER,Yeah.
7,12,1214,ELAINE,Hey.
7,12,1214,KRAMER,"Oh. So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?"
7,12,1214,ELAINE,"Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even"
7,12,1215,KRAMER,It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.
7,12,1215,ELAINE,No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like
7,12,1217,KRAMER,"Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He"
7,12,1218,ELAINE,"This is not the point. The point is, you just can't"
7,12,1219,KRAMER,"Boy, I am really surprised at you. You are"
7,12,1222,KRAMER,I always put you up here...
7,12,1223,KRAMER,...They're over here. Now you're... aww-whawww.

7,12,1227,KRAMER,Digidi.
7,12,1230,GEORGE,"Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody"
7,12,1231,SUSAN,"Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more."
7,12,1231,GEORGE,Why not?
7,12,1231,SUSAN,"Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told"
7,12,1232,GEORGE,"So, what're you saying?"
7,12,1232,SUSAN,They're gonna name their baby Seven.
7,12,1232,GEORGE,"What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name,"
7,12,1233,SUSAN,I can't believe that they're using it.
7,12,1233,GEORGE,Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose
7,12,1234,SUSAN,I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with.
7,12,1234,GEORGE,"Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the"

7,12,1262,ELAINE,Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
7,12,1263,JERRY,Haven't seen him. How's the neck?
7,12,1263,ELAINE,His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was
7,12,1266,JERRY,"Boy, I'm surprised. I would think Kramer would have a"
7,12,1267,ELAINE,"Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the"

7,12,1268,ELAINE,I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of
7,12,1269,JERRY,Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?
7,12,1269,ELAINE,What d'you care?
7,12,1269,JERRY,Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
7,12,1272,ELAINE,Did you have a nice ride?

7,12,1276,KRAMER,Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a
7,12,1277,ELAINE,What? You never told me that.
7,12,1277,KRAMER,"Well, it's common sense."
7,12,1277,ELAINE,"Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous."
7,12,1277,KRAMER,"Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should"
7,12,1278,ELAINE,Yeah Jerry.
7,12,1278,JERRY,"Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but"
7,12,1280,ELAINE,"Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?"
7,12,1280,KRAMER,"Alright, I'm down."
7,12,1280,JERRY,"Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story"
7,12,1287,ELAINE,"So, that's the situation."
7,12,1287,NEWMAN,Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly
7,12,1292,KRAMER,Newman!

7,12,1346,ELAINE,"Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. Cut the stupid thing"
7,12,1347,KRAMER,"No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another"

7,12,1369,CHRISTIE,"If it's all the same to you, I think I'm just gonna go to"
