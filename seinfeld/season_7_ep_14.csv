7,14,30,GEORGE,"Marisa Tomei! I, just spoke to Marisa Tomei!"
7,14,32,GEORGE,"You know, I can't remember the last time I called a woman without being"
7,14,33,ELAINE,"Okay, well that's all the time we have for today."
7,14,35,GEORGE,"Hey, where you going?"
7,14,35,ELAINE,I got stuff to do.
7,14,35,GEORGE,What? You can't leave yet.
7,14,35,ELAINE,Why not?
7,14,35,GEORGE,We have to discuss my alibi.
7,14,35,ELAINE,Alibi? What does that have to do with me?
7,14,35,GEORGE,I usually spend Saturday afternoons with Susan. She's gonna want to know
7,14,36,ELAINE,"Oh, so you wanna say you were with me?"
7,14,36,GEORGE,Yes.
7,14,36,ELAINE,"Puh. Okay, fine. You were with me."
7,14,37,GEORGE,"Wait a second, wait. Why are we together?"
7,14,37,ELAINE,What is the difference?
7,14,37,GEORGE,"Because, if you ever see her and it comes up, we have to be in sync."
7,14,40,GEORGE,"Okay. Now, why do I have to see you?"
7,14,42,ELAINE,"Ah! Because, I'm going to the dentist, and I'm afraid, and I want you to"
7,14,44,GEORGE,It's no good.
7,14,45,ELAINE,Okay. Fine.
7,14,45,GEORGE,What?
7,14,45,ELAINE,I don't like the way you just rejected my suggestion.
7,14,45,GEORGE,"Hey, hey, let's not get so defensive here. This is a give and take"
7,14,46,ELAINE,"I thought that my suggestion was good. And, I think you could've been a"
7,14,47,GEORGE,"Okay, look. We've never worked"
7,14,51,ELAINE,Okay.
7,14,51,GEORGE,Alright?
7,14,51,ELAINE,Okay.
7,14,51,GEORGE,Okay.
7,14,51,ELAINE,Fine.
7,14,51,GEORGE,Good.
7,14,51,ELAINE,"Fine, fine, fine."
7,14,53,GEORGE,Okay. How about this?
7,14,53,ELAINE,What?
7,14,53,GEORGE,You are having problems with your boyfriend and I
7,14,54,ELAINE,I don't have a boyfriend.
7,14,54,GEORGE,She doesn't know that. We say that you do.
7,14,54,ELAINE,Ech.
7,14,54,GEORGE,It's good. Believe me.
7,14,54,ELAINE,I thought my idea was just as good.
7,14,54,GEORGE,The dentist thing?
7,14,54,ELAINE,"Yeah, right. The dentist thing."
7,14,54,GEORGE,"Alright, the dentist thing was not good."
7,14,54,ELAINE,"Okay, alright. What's his name? Who is he?"
7,14,54,GEORGE,Art Vandelay.
7,14,54,ELAINE,Art Vandelay? This is my boyfriend?
7,14,54,GEORGE,That's your boyfriend.
7,14,54,ELAINE,What does he do?
7,14,54,GEORGE,He's an importer.
7,14,54,ELAINE,Just imports? No exports?
7,14,54,GEORGE,He's an importer-exporter. Okay?
7,14,54,ELAINE,"Okay. So, I'm dating Art Vandelay. What is the problem we're discussing?"
7,14,54,GEORGE,Yes. Yes.
7,14,54,ELAINE,Yi-yi-yi.
7,14,55,ELAINE,"Ah! How 'bout this? How about, he's"
7,14,59,ELAINE,"Oh, what? You don't like that suggestion either?"
7,14,59,GEORGE,It's very complicated.
7,14,59,ELAINE,"You know, it seems to me that it's all you, and"
7,14,65,MORTY,What're you doing? Are you making coffee?
7,14,65,HELEN,Yeah.
7,14,65,MORTY,"Well, maybe you better make a pot of tea, too."
7,14,65,HELEN,"Morty, you're driving me crazy."
7,14,65,MORTY,"Look, I don't want anything to go wrong. If this woman votes to impeach"
7,14,66,HELEN,You wanna drive a Cadillac? Expect to pay the consequences.
7,14,67,MORTY,There she is.
7,14,68,MORTY,"Hello. Hello, Mrs Choate."
7,14,68,HELEN,"Oh, come in, come in. May I take your coat."
7,14,68,MRS. CHOATE,"No, no. I prefer to wear it. Nobody's taking my coat."
7,14,68,HELEN,"Ah, how 'bout a cup of coffee or something?"
7,14,68,MRS. CHOATE,"Coffee? Ach. I'll take hot water with lemon, if you have it."
7,14,68,HELEN,I'll see. Have a seat. That's a lovely scarf
7,14,70,MRS. CHOATE,"Ahh, they're a dime a dozen."
7,14,71,HELEN,"Oh, hi Jerry. Mrs Choate, this is my son, Jerry."
7,14,75,JERRY,Gimme that rye!
7,14,75,MRS. CHOATE,"Stop it. Let go. Help! Someone, help!"
7,14,76,JERRY,"Shut up, you old bag!"
7,14,77,MRS. CHOATE,"Thief! Stop him! Stop him, he's got my rye!"
7,14,79,JERRY,Nice to meet you.
7,14,79,MRS. CHOATE,Hello.
7,14,79,MORTY,Jerry lives in New York. You just came from
7,14,82,MRS. CHOATE,"Yeah. I was visiting my daughter, and I'll never go back. The crime"
7,14,86,HELEN,"Oh, that's terrible. They stole a rye? Why would they steal a"
7,14,87,MORTY,That's what the city's turning into. They'll steal anything.
7,14,87,MRS. CHOATE,They're like savages.
7,14,87,JERRY,"Yeah, there's some sickos out there."
7,14,87,MRS. CHOATE,You look very familiar. Have we ever met?
7,14,87,JERRY,You ever go to Camp Tiyoga?
7,14,87,HELEN,Maybe you've seen him on television.
7,14,87,MORTY,Jerry's a comedian.
7,14,87,MRS. CHOATE,"Naw, I don't watch TV."
7,14,88,JERRY,"Well, it was nice meeting you."
7,14,88,MORTY,"Jerry, don't go."
7,14,88,JERRY,"Ah, I think I'll go."
7,14,89,MRS. CHOATE,"So, Morty, what's this all about? What d'you want?"
7,14,92,SUSAN,"Hey, where're you going?"
7,14,92,GEORGE,Wha..? I didn't tell you? I gotta go meet Elaine.
7,14,92,SUSAN,Elaine? What for?
7,14,92,GEORGE,I don't know. She..She's having some problems with this guy she's
7,14,93,SUSAN,I didn't even know she was dating anyone.
7,14,93,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. She's seeing this guy, Art Vandelay."
7,14,93,SUSAN,So what does he do?
7,14,93,GEORGE,He's an importer-exporter.
7,14,93,SUSAN,What kind of problems are they having?
7,14,93,GEORGE,"Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit"
7,14,96,SUSAN,Are you having an affair with Elaine?
7,14,96,GEORGE,Right. C'mon! I'm having an affair with
7,14,99,SUSAN,Huh?
7,14,132,NICK,I'll get you! I'll get you Kramer! You
7,14,135,MORTY,"Alright, are you ready to eat?"
7,14,135,HELEN,"Oh, right, let's go. Jerry, let's go, it's time"
7,14,138,JERRY,Dinner? W..What time is it?
7,14,138,HELEN,It's four-thirty.
7,14,138,JERRY,Four-thirty? Who eats dinner at four-thirty?
7,14,138,MORTY,"By the time we sit down, it'll be quarter to five."
7,14,138,JERRY,I don't understand why we have to eat now.
7,14,138,HELEN,We gotta catch the early-bird. It's only between four-thirty and six.
7,14,138,MORTY,"Yeah. They give you a tenderloin, a salad and a baked potato, for"
7,14,139,JERRY,"Can't we eat at a decent hour? I'll treat, okay?"
7,14,139,HELEN,You're not buying us dinner.
7,14,139,JERRY,I'm not force-feeding myself a steak at four-thirty to save a
7,14,140,HELEN,"Alright, we'll wait. But it's unheard"
7,14,145,GEORGE,"...So, anyway, if you think about it, manure is not really that bad a"
7,14,147,MARISA,You're so right. I never thought of it like that. Manure.
7,14,149,MARISA,Did you just make that up?
7,14,149,GEORGE,"What, you think I'm doing material here?"
7,14,149,MARISA,"No, no. It's hard to believe anyone could be so spontaneously"
7,14,150,GEORGE,And I'm a little tired.
7,14,151,MARISA,"So, tell me, how is it that a man like you, so bald, and so quirky and"
7,14,152,GEORGE,"Well, Marisa. See, the thing is... I'm sort of engaged."
7,14,153,MARISA,What?
7,14,153,GEORGE,"I'm, you know, engaged."
7,14,160,JERRY,"Hey look, there's a spot right in front."
7,14,160,MORTY,"Always, Jerry. Always."
7,14,162,DORIS,Was that delicious or what?
7,14,162,JACK,Where you gonna get a better meal than that?
7,14,162,DORIS,Better than Danny's.

7,14,163,MORTY,Hello Jack.
7,14,163,HELEN,Doris.
7,14,163,DORIS,"Hello, hello."
7,14,163,JERRY,Jack.
7,14,163,DORIS,"Hello, Jerry."
7,14,163,JERRY,Hi Doris.
7,14,163,JACK,"Hello Morty. Well, missed the early bird."
7,14,163,MORTY,"Yeah, so?"
7,14,163,JACK,Must be nice to have that kind of money.
7,14,164,JACK,"Bernie, look who's eating at six o'clock. Your suddenly"
7,14,167,MORTY,They're not kicking me out. You don't have the votes.
7,14,167,JACK,That's what you think.
7,14,167,MORTY,We'll see.
7,14,167,JACK,"Yes, we will."
7,14,167,JERRY,"Awright, let's eat already."
7,14,170,ELAINE,"Hi, Susan."
7,14,170,SUSAN,Hi.
7,14,170,ELAINE,"Hi. Come in, come in. Have a seat."
7,14,171,SUSAN,"Uh, Elaine, I have to ask you a question."
7,14,171,ELAINE,"Oh, sure."
7,14,171,SUSAN,Are you having an affair with George?
7,14,171,ELAINE,"Wha...?! Ha ha ha. Ha, no."
7,14,172,ELAINE,"Don't be ridiculous! I mean, why would anyone"
7,14,174,ELAINE,"...Well, obviously... You know... Ap..ap, Chu... Why would"
7,14,175,SUSAN,"Ohh, because he said that he had to talk with you earlier about some"
7,14,176,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, I did have to talk with him. I"
7,14,177,SUSAN,Art Vandelay?
7,14,177,ELAINE,"Yeah, Art Vandelay."
7,14,177,SUSAN,I'm sorry. I feel like an idiot.
7,14,177,ELAINE,"No, no. Huh-hu-hu. It's okay."
7,14,177,SUSAN,"Oh, just forget that we ever talked. Okay?"
7,14,177,ELAINE,It is so forgotten.
7,14,177,SUSAN,Alright.
7,14,178,ELAINE,"Okay. Okay, no problem."
7,14,179,SUSAN,"So, was George helpful at all?"
7,14,179,ELAINE,"Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, he was very helpful. Uhm,"
7,14,181,SUSAN,Yeah.
7,14,181,ELAINE,"Uhm, George felt that I was too adamant in"
7,14,182,SUSAN,Wait a minute. I thought that Art wanted to
7,14,183,ELAINE,What'd I say?
7,14,183,SUSAN,The importing.
7,14,183,ELAINE,I did. Uh...

7,14,183,ELAINE,Diapers.
7,14,183,SUSAN,I'm sorry for bothering you.
7,14,183,ELAINE,"Oh, no, it's okay."
7,14,184,ELAINE,Okay.
7,14,186,ELAINE,"C'mon, George, pick up. Oh, pick up. Oh, pick up."

7,14,202,MORTY,"Nice to see you, Mrs Choate."
7,14,202,MRS. CHOATE,"Hello, Morty."
7,14,203,HERB,"Building A. Are you for, or against, the motion to impeach?"
7,14,203,RALPH,What does that mean?
7,14,203,HERB,"It means, if you're for the motion, you're against Morty."
7,14,203,RALPH,So why don't you say that?
7,14,203,HERB,"Hey, I'm running the meeting."

7,14,207,MRS. CHOATE,"Oh, thief! Thief!"
7,14,209,MRS. CHOATE,It's him. It's your son. Now I know where I saw
7,14,210,MORTY,My son never stole anything. He's a good boy.
7,14,210,RALPH,They should lock him up.
7,14,210,MRS. CHOATE,"Like father, like son. I change"
