7,15,1,DOCTOR,I'll need a urine sample.
7,15,1,ELAINE,Right.
7,15,2,GEORGE,You know how hot it gets there? Like 150 degrees. Your skin is gonna be simmering with boils.
7,15,2,ELAINE,"Oh, Come on."
7,15,2,JERRY,"Hey George, you coming to the Tonight Show on Thursday?"
7,15,2,GEORGE,"Hey, yeah. My parents want to come too, is that ok?"
7,15,2,JERRY,"Yeah, sure. My parents will be there."
7,15,2,ELAINE,The Tonight Show?
7,15,2,JERRY,"Yeah, they're in town this week, you wanna go?"
7,15,2,ELAINE,Are you doing new material?
7,15,2,JERRY,No.
7,15,2,ELAINE,I don't think so.
7,15,3,KRAMER,Hey. Super's in my bathroom changing my shower head. Have they
7,15,4,JERRY,"No, he's doing mine next. They're low flow you know."
7,15,4,KRAMER,Low flow? Well I don't like the sound of that.
7,15,5,ELAINE,So what are your parents doing here in new York?
7,15,5,JERRY,"Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, my father"
7,15,6,ELAINE,So what are their plans?
7,15,6,JERRY,"Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new development."
7,15,8,ELAINE,You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?
7,15,8,JERRY,"No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, he moved"
7,15,9,GEORGE,Uncle Leo's having regular sex?
7,15,9,JERRY,"Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing."
7,15,9,JERRY,Hello?
7,15,9,MORTY,"Jerry, what time do we have to be at the the Tonight Show on Thursday."
7,15,9,JERRY,You gotta be there at 4:30.
7,15,9,MORTY,But it comes on 11:30.
7,15,9,JERRY,"Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 11:30."
7,15,9,MORTY,How long they been doing this?
7,15,9,JERRY,30 years.
7,15,9,MORTY,"Helen, did you know that they tape this thing in the afternoon?"
7,15,9,JERRY,"All right, I'll see you later."
7,15,9,ELAINE,"Georgie, how come your parents never moved to Florida?"
7,15,9,GEORGE,"Yeah, that is odd, isn't it?"
7,15,9,JERRY,"Yeah, it is."
7,15,9,GEORGE,"I mean, they're retired."
7,15,9,JERRY,No economic reason for them to be here.
7,15,9,GEORGE,They have no friends.
7,15,9,JERRY,No social reason for them to be here.
7,15,9,ELAINE,You're all grown up.
7,15,9,GEORGE,"Yeah, they're all through ruining my life. What the hell are they"
7,15,12,JERRY,Hello?
7,15,12,HELEN,Where can I buy some ice? Your father likes a lot of ice.
7,15,12,JERRY,"I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?"
7,15,12,HELEN,I can do that.
7,15,12,JERRY,You know Dad just called me.
7,15,12,HELEN,"Yeah, I know. His phlebitis is acting up."
7,15,12,JERRY,"Yeah, all right, well I got some people here."
7,15,12,HELEN,Ok.
7,15,12,JERRY,"All right, bye. : You see this? Any thought pops into their"
7,15,13,ELAINE,Ahh.
7,15,13,JERRY,I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got
7,15,14,ELAINE,They have no idea when they're going back to Florida?
7,15,14,JERRY,The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has
7,15,15,ELAINE,How's that gonna happen?
7,15,16,UNCLE LEO,It's about time you called your uncle. We've got to do this once a
7,15,17,JERRY,Once a week? So how's Lydia?
7,15,17,UNCLE LEO,"Ah, she's a real tiger."
7,15,17,JERRY,I don't know how you do it.
7,15,17,UNCLE LEO,What?
7,15,17,JERRY,"A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't know. But it's"
7,15,18,UNCLE LEO,What are you talking about?
7,15,18,JERRY,Well...
7,15,18,UNCLE LEO,"Look at this, I told them medium rare, it's medium."
7,15,18,JERRY,"Hey, it happens."
7,15,18,UNCLE LEO,I bet that cook is an anti-Semite.
7,15,18,JERRY,He has no idea who you are.
7,15,18,UNCLE LEO,"They don't just overcook a hamburger, Jerry."
7,15,18,JERRY,"All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your"
7,15,24,UNCLE LEO,"Believe me, I thought about it. But she is so perfect in every way,"
7,15,25,JERRY,"Well, keep looking."
7,15,26,PETERMAN,"I'm afraid I have some bad news, Elaine. It appears you will not be"
7,15,27,ELAINE,What? Why not?
7,15,27,PETERMAN,"I'm afraid it's your urine, Elaine. You tested positive for opium."
7,15,27,ELAINE,Opium?
7,15,27,PETERMAN,"That's right, Elaine. White lotus. Yam-yam. Shanghai Sally."
7,15,27,ELAINE,"Ihat's impossible, I've never done a drug in my life. Dr. Strugatz"
7,15,28,PETERMAN,Not a chance. I'm afraid I'll just have to find someone else to
7,15,30,ELAINE,"Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this test. I"
7,15,32,PETERMAN,"All right, Elaine."
7,15,32,ELAINE,"Oh, thank you Mr. Peterman. I'll be ready"
7,15,34,GEORGE,"Whew! Boy, it's cold outside, huh? Oh, these New York winters, huh."
7,15,35,FRANK,"I was out for five minutes before, I couldn't feel my extremities."
7,15,35,ESTELLE,What extremities?
7,15,35,GEORGE,You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? Seventy-nine.
7,15,37,ESTELLE,"So George, why are you here?"
7,15,37,GEORGE,"What, I can't stop by and visit my parents? (Drops pamphlet on coffee"
7,15,38,ESTELLE,What's this.
7,15,38,GEORGE,That's where the Seinfeld's are moving. They got a great deal. Yep.
7,15,40,ESTELLE,I don't bet.
7,15,40,GEORGE,What about the dolphins? You could swim with the dolphins down there.
7,15,40,ESTELLE,I don't swim.
7,15,40,GEORGE,You could pet them. They come right out of the water onto the
7,15,41,ESTELLE,Are you trying to get rid of us?
7,15,41,GEORGE,"Rid? Nah, c'mon, the word is 'care'. Care. I care about your"
7,15,44,ELAINE,No?
7,15,46,KRAMER,Jerry? Jerry!
7,15,47,KRAMER,"Wha, you too?"
7,15,47,JERRY,Yeah!
7,15,47,KRAMER,"These showers are horrible. There's no pressure, I can't get the"
7,15,48,JERRY,Me either.
7,15,48,KRAMER,If I don't have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak and
7,15,49,JERRY,You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. I'm gonna have to
7,15,50,KRAMER,Aw.
7,15,50,JERRY,Where are you going?
7,15,50,KRAMER,I gotta find another shower.
7,15,52,KRAMER,They got you too?
7,15,52,NEWMAN,This stuff is awful! I'm not Newman!
7,15,54,KRAMER,"Oh, Elaine. Yeah."
7,15,54,ELAINE,"Kramer, you look terrible."
7,15,54,KRAMER,"Look, I need the keys to your apartment, I gotta take a shower."
7,15,54,ELAINE,What's wrong with your shower?
7,15,54,KRAMER,There's no water pressure.
7,15,54,ELAINE,Why don't you just go see Jerry?
7,15,56,KRAMER,Jerry's got nothing. Newman's got nothing. You're the only one I know
7,15,58,PETERMAN,Not on my watch! I won't
7,15,60,ELAINE,Mr Peterman! What are you doing?
7,15,60,PETERMAN,"Elaine, you're out of control. You need help."
7,15,60,ELAINE,Huh?
7,15,60,PETERMAN,I know what you're going through. I too once fell under the spell of
7,15,64,ELAINE,"Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not addicted to"
7,15,65,PETERMAN,"Oh, Elaine. The toll road of denial is a long and dangerous one."
7,15,67,HELEN,All they serve is chicken?
7,15,67,JERRY,There's more food down the hall.
7,15,67,MORTY,"Wrap it up, we'll take it home."
7,15,68,JERRY,"Oh, hi."
7,15,68,ESTELLE,Hello Seinfelds.
7,15,68,MORTY,Hello.
7,15,68,HELEN,Hi.
7,15,68,FRANK,This is your dressing room? They treat you like Toscanini.
7,15,68,ESTELLE,"Oh, Jerry. I don't know how you could do this. I'm so nervous for"
7,15,69,JERRY,"Actually, I'm drunk."
7,15,69,GEORGE,"Hey, hey, how was Florida?"
7,15,69,MORTY,"Well, we just bought a new place down there."
7,15,69,ESTELLE,"I know, we were looking at the brochure."
7,15,69,MORTY,What?
7,15,69,HELEN,"Why, you thinking of moving?"
7,15,69,FRANK,Not really.
7,15,69,MORTY,"Because if you are, you shouldn't. There's nothing available in that"
7,15,70,FRANK,Are you telling me there's not one condo available in all of Del Boca
7,15,71,MORTY,That's right. They went like hotcakes.
7,15,71,FRANK,How'd you get yours?
7,15,71,MORTY,Got lucky.
7,15,71,FRANK,Are you trying to keep us out of Del Boca Vista?!
7,15,71,JERRY,"I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps"
7,15,75,ELAINE,"How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand,"
7,15,76,WAITRESS,"Yeah, it's hard to figure."
7,15,76,ELAINE,"I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna meet the"
7,15,77,WAITRESS,"Ah, the bushmen?"
7,15,77,ELAINE,And the bushwomen.
7,15,77,MAN,Excuse me. I couldn't help overhearing.
7,15,78,ELAINE,"Yeah, I eat these muffins all the time."
7,15,78,MAN,"Well, you know what opium is made from..."
7,15,78,ELAINE,Poppies!
7,15,79,JAY,"Welcome back. Talking with Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry, lemme ask you, I saw"
7,15,80,JERRY,"Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; they're"
7,15,87,JERRY,"Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of"
7,15,92,JERRY,"Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, isn't"
7,15,93,KRAMER,"Yeah, well I'm really happy for ya."
7,15,93,JERRY,"Hey, you're not giving it to me, man. What's wrong?"
7,15,93,KRAMER,"I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath?"
7,15,93,JERRY,No good?
7,15,93,KRAMER,It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my own filth.
7,15,94,JERRY,"Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?"
7,15,94,KRAMER,"Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in that."
7,15,94,JERRY,Chicken?
7,15,94,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah."
7,15,95,ELAINE,"Well, this you're not gonna believe. I found out why I was testing"
7,15,96,JERRY,Poppy seeds!
7,15,96,KRAMER,"Well, that makes sense. Want some chicken?"
7,15,96,ELAINE,"Yeah. Thanks. So, I'm gonna get tested again later, hopefully I'll"
7,15,98,JERRY,Hello Newman.
7,15,98,NEWMAN,"Hello Jerry. Well, I may have a solution to our little problem."
7,15,99,ELAINE,"Oh c'mon, Newman."
7,15,99,NEWMAN,I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants. (Opens
7,15,100,ELAINE,Jerry?
7,15,100,NEWMAN,"Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it!"
7,15,104,JERRY,Not from the footage I've seen.
7,15,104,NEWMAN,"Nevertheless, sometime this afternoon, behind the Market Diner, an"
7,15,105,KRAMER,I'm down.
7,15,105,NEWMAN,Jerry?
7,15,107,ESTELLE,"So, Georgie, we have some big news for you."
7,15,107,GEORGE,Big news?
7,15,107,ESTELLE,We're moving to Florida.
7,15,107,GEORGE,What? You're moving to Florida!?! That's wonderful! I'm
7,15,109,FRANK,"Has nothing to do with the weather, it's because of the Seinfelds."
7,15,109,GEORGE,What do you mean?
7,15,109,FRANK,"They don't want us there, so we're going. We're moving right into Del"
7,15,110,GEORGE,So you're moving there for spite!
7,15,110,FRANK,Absolutely. No one tells Frank Costanza what to do!
7,15,110,GEORGE,"That's right, who the hell are they? How dare they?!"
7,15,110,ESTELLE,"So, Georgie, are you gonna come to visit us?"
7,15,110,GEORGE,"Oh, every chance I get."
7,15,110,ESTELLE,Ohhh.
7,15,111,GEORGE,Jerry? Jerry! I'm busting! I'm busting!
7,15,111,JERRY,What's going on?
7,15,111,GEORGE,My parents are moving to Florida!
7,15,111,JERRY,Are you kidding?
7,15,111,GEORGE,Can you believe it? It's happening! It's finally happening! I'm
7,15,112,JERRY,Where are they moving to?
7,15,112,GEORGE,Del Boca Vista!
7,15,112,JERRY,"Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live!"
7,15,112,GEORGE,I know!
7,15,112,JERRY,We could visit together!
7,15,112,GEORGE,Every five years!
7,15,113,JERRY,That's incredible!
7,15,113,GEORGE,"I know, I know and you know *why* they're moving there?"
7,15,113,JERRY,Why?
7,15,113,GEORGE,To spite your parents!
7,15,113,JERRY,To spite my parents?
7,15,113,GEORGE,Yeah!
7,15,113,JERRY,Your parents are crazy!
7,15,113,GEORGE,"I know, they're out of their minds! It's fantastic!"
7,15,113,JERRY,My parents are moving back too!
7,15,113,GEORGE,Beautiful!
7,15,114,MORTY,I'm sorry Leo's moving back here. I'm not ready to go back to Florida.
7,15,114,HELEN,"He was getting along so well with that woman, what happened?"
7,15,115,MORTY,Hello?
7,15,115,VOICE,This is Frank Costanza.
7,15,115,MORTY,What do you want?
7,15,115,FRANK,"You think you could keep us out of Florida? We're moving in lock, stock"
7,15,118,MORTY,"I'm sorry, we can't go back to Florida."
7,15,119,GEORGE,I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner.
7,15,119,JERRY,You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this.
7,15,122,JERRY,Hello.
7,15,122,MORTY,"Hello, Jerry? It's your father."
7,15,122,JERRY,"Oh, hi dad."
7,15,122,MORTY,"Listen, is it all right if we move in with you for a little while?"
7,15,123,MORTY,What was that?
7,15,123,JERRY,"Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna"
7,15,124,MORTY,Because the Costanzas are moving into Del Boca Vista.
7,15,124,JERRY,But it's a big complex.
7,15,124,MORTY,"You don't understand, you gotta have a buffer zone."
7,15,124,JERRY,"All right, fine. Come over here."
7,15,124,GEOPRGE,What?
7,15,124,JERRY,They're not going back to Florida. They're moving here.
7,15,124,GEORGE,What? Why?
7,15,124,JERRY,Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went
7,15,125,GEORGE,"Hey, I'm sorry, you had your buffer zone for many years. It's my turn"
7,15,126,JERRY,"You know what you're doing, don't you? You're killing Independent"
7,15,128,LEO,Move back with Lydia?
7,15,128,JERRY,"C'mon, you're lucky to have anybody."
7,15,128,LEO,"Last week you told me I was in my prime, I should be swinging."
7,15,128,JERRY,"Swinging? What are you, out of your mind? Look at you, you're"
7,15,132,LEO,But she's an anti-Semite.
7,15,132,JERRY,Can you blame her?
7,15,133,HELEN,"You don't think he minds us staying here, do you?"
7,15,133,MORTY,Why would he mind? We're his parents.
7,15,134,ELAINE,Oh.
7,15,134,HELEN,Hi Elaine.
7,15,134,ELAINE,Hello. Jerry's not here?
7,15,134,HELEN,No.
7,15,134,ELAINE,Huh. Oh my god.
7,15,134,HELEN,What?
7,15,134,ELAINE,"A poppy seed! It must have been in the chicken. Oh, I'm dead. I'm"
7,15,135,HELEN,Why?
7,15,135,ELAINE,It's a long story.
7,15,135,HELEN,"Just a second, I have to go to the bathroom."
7,15,135,ELAINE,What are you gonna do in there?
7,15,135,HELEN,What am I gonna do in the bathroom?
7,15,135,ELAINE,You gotta do me a favor.
7,15,135,HELEN,"Elaine, I really--"
7,15,135,ELAINE,"Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld, I need your sample."
7,15,135,HELEN,You want my urine?
7,15,135,ELAINE,I need a clean urine sample from a woman.
7,15,135,HELEN,I don't know.
7,15,135,ELAINE,"Oh please, Mrs. Seinfeld, please?"
7,15,135,HELEN,"Well, what am I gonna do it in?"
7,15,135,ELAINE,"Well, one of those glasses."
7,15,135,HELEN,Jerry's glasses?
7,15,135,ELAINE,"Yeah, he won't mind. C'mon, you're his mom."
7,15,136,ELAINE,"Yeah, a coffee cup's fine."
7,15,136,HELEN,Or maybe a juice glass.
7,15,136,ELAINE,"Yes, fine, fine, a juice glass is perfect."
7,15,136,HELEN,This one is kind of scratched.
7,15,136,ELAINE,It doesn't matter.
7,15,136,HELEN,Howbout A milk glass.
7,15,136,ELAINE,"A milk glass, a juice glass, any glass, just pick a glass."
7,15,136,HELEN,Jerry doesn't wash these very well.
7,15,136,ELAINE,"Mrs. Seinfeld, pick a glass! Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld!"
7,15,137,SALESMAN,"All right, I got everything here. I got the Cyclone F series, Hydra"
7,15,138,JERRY,What do you recommend?
7,15,138,SALESMAN,What are you looking for?
7,15,138,KRAMER,"Power, man. Power."
7,15,138,NEWMAN,Like Silkwood.
7,15,138,KRAMER,That's for radiation.
7,15,138,NEWMAN,That's right.
7,15,138,KRAMER,"Now, what is this?"
7,15,138,SALESMAN,"That's the Commando 450, I don't sell that one. What about thi-"
7,15,138,KRAMER,"Well that's what we want, the Commando"
7,15,139,NEWMAN,We'll pay anything. We've got the
7,15,140,KRAMER,"He couldn't handle that, he's delicate."
7,15,141,HELEN,It's nice being back at Leo's Jerry's place was too small.
7,15,141,MORTY,"First Leo breaks up, then he goes back. What the hell's going on?"
7,15,142,MORTY,Who is it?
7,15,142,SUPER,It's the super. We're installing new low-flow showerheads in all the
7,15,143,MORTY,Low flow? I don't like the sound of that.
7,15,144,PETERMAN,"So as a result of your test being free of opium, I am reinstating you."
7,15,144,ELAINE,Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa?
7,15,144,PETERMAN,I'm afraid I can't take you.
7,15,144,ELAINE,What? Why not?
7,15,144,PETERMAN,"Elaine, according to your urine analysis, you're menopausal. you"
7,15,145,ELAINE,But I wanted to see the bushmen.
7,15,145,PETERMAN,"Oh, and one more thing. You may have osteoporosis."
7,15,147,JERRY,"Well, it's been a great visit."
7,15,147,MORTY,"Jerry, I'll tell ya. The first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to"
7,15,148,JERRY,"Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move."
7,15,149,HELEN,George must be happy about that.
7,15,149,JERRY,You have no idea.
7,15,150,FRANK,Take my swim trunks. I won't need them.
7,15,150,ESTELLE,What does he want with your swim trunks?
7,15,150,FRANK,Why should they go to waste?!?
7,15,151,THE END,
