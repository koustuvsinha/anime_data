7,17,0,THE FRIARS CLUB,Written by David Mandel
7,17,1,JERRY,"The other thing I love is when you're in the middle of a dream, and the alarm goes off. You incorporate the sound of the alarm into the dream, so you can keep sleeping. And you'll make any adjustment in the dream to do it. I was with Marie Antoinette in a dream last night, and she was on the guillotine, the blade came down, her head fell into the basket, it rolled over and she started singing Neil Diamond's 'Solitary Man'. And, I thought, ""That is not my alarm going off. This is actually happening."""
7,17,4,GEORGE,June. It's June.
7,17,6,GEORGE,Hey!
7,17,8,GEORGE,It's June.
7,17,10,GEORGE,"June, June, June."
7,17,11,GEORGE,"Hey, he-hah. It's June, June."

7,17,23,GEORGE,"Aah, hey. If this works out, forget about it."
7,17,25,JERRY,"So, set it up. You know what, we could have dinner at the Friars Club."

7,17,30,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, turns out that the master slept only twenty minutes every"
7,17,33,JERRY,Just imagine how much more you'll accomplish.
7,17,33,KRAMER,"Oh, I got a lot of things in the hopper, buddy."

7,17,34,KRAMER,"Oh, I got a hopper. A big hopper."

7,17,44,BOB,"Ah, could you repeat that?"
7,17,44,PETERMAN,Why don't you handle all the copy-editing?
7,17,45,BOB,I..I'm sorry. What?
7,17,45,PETERMAN,Copy-editing!
7,17,46,PETERMAN,"Eh, never mind. Elaine, you do it."

7,17,106,ELAINE,"I'm stuck here, editing the stupid catalogue, because of"
7,17,109,ELAINE,"Listen, there is something really suspicious about this guy. Every"
7,17,111,JERRY,You think he's faking?
7,17,111,ELAINE,"I don't know. But I'd like to try that earpiece on, see if it's real."
7,17,112,BOB,"Hey Elaine. Oh, you have a friend."

7,17,117,BOB,Thank you. I'm having lunch with Mr P. I better get going.
7,17,118,ELAINE,"Did you see that? Did you see that, Jerry?"
7,17,118,JERRY,That was him?
7,17,118,ELAINE,Yes.
7,17,118,JERRY,Somehow I thought he'd be taller.
7,17,118,ELAINE,"Alright, listen, we'll have to do this again some other time, okay? I"
7,17,119,JERRY,"Alright, I'll see you later."

7,17,146,GEORGE,We might have an 'it'!
7,17,146,JERRY,She's got 'it' written all over her.
7,17,146,GEORGE,"She's got everything, right? She's"
7,17,147,JERRY,"Well, I dunno. I didn't really talk to her."
7,17,147,GEORGE,"Well, she's smart. You take my word for it."
7,17,147,JERRY,Whatever.
7,17,147,GEORGE,Hehee. W..we could be like the Gatsbys. Didn't they always
7,17,148,JERRY,That doesn't sound right.

7,17,155,JERRY,The cleaners? How did it get there?
7,17,155,KRAMER,"Well, I, uh, I borrowed it last night and it got a little dirty."
7,17,155,JERRY,Great.
7,17,155,KRAMER,Somehow I dozed off and woke up in a pile of
7,17,156,JERRY,Somehow? You've had an hour and twenty minutes sleep in three days!
7,17,156,KRAMER,"Well, so, look, the cleaner said you could pick it up tonight at six."

7,17,283,GEORGE,Why not?
7,17,283,JERRY,"Ah, I'm a little turned off."
7,17,283,GEORGE,"C'mon, what're you talking about?"
7,17,283,JERRY,"Ahh, I'm, I'm kinda soured."
7,17,283,GEORGE,You're soured?
7,17,283,JERRY,"Yeah, I'm soured."
7,17,283,GEORGE,Don't be soured.
7,17,283,JERRY,I'm sorry. I'm soured.
7,17,283,GEORGE,What're you kidding me? We were all getting along so well.
7,17,284,JERRY,"Well, you know, frankly, I don't think she was too concerned about my"
7,17,285,GEORGE,What're you talking about?! She's very concerned! She said
7,17,286,JERRY,"Yeah, we'll see."
7,17,286,GEORGE,"Because if she gets it back, then you'll have no reason"
7,17,287,JERRY,I'll try and de-sour.
7,17,287,GEORGE,"Oh, that's not good enough! You don't try and de-sour."
7,17,288,JERRY,I'll try! I'll try and de-sour and sweeten.
7,17,288,GEORGE,I wanna get it back when we were the Gatsbys.
7,17,288,JERRY,I still don't know what that means.
7,17,288,GEORGE,"Yeah, well."

7,17,289,JERRY,Who?
7,17,289,KRAMER,Connie!
7,17,289,JERRY,What'd she do?
7,17,289,KRAMER,I don't know! But I woke up in the Hudson river
7,17,291,JERRY,Why would she try and kill you?
7,17,291,KRAMER,"Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't want anybody else to"
7,17,293,KRAMER,Gah!
7,17,297,JERRY,"Hey, there's uncle Milty."
7,17,297,GEORGE,"Yeah, it is."
7,17,297,JERRY,And there's David Steinberg.

7,17,298,JERRY,"Hey, there's Pat. Hey, Pat."
7,17,298,PAT,"Hey, Jerry. What the hell went wrong? What's the matter with you? Are"
7,17,299,JERRY,I forgot to take it off.
7,17,299,PAT,"You forgot to take it off? Oh, you go into a department store,"
7,17,301,JERRY,I'm sorry.
7,17,301,PAT,Where's the jacket?
7,17,301,JERRY,"Well, one of the gypsies took it."
7,17,301,PAT,"Aww, the gypsies took it! Of course, New York has a lot of"
7,17,302,GEORGE,"Well, it's true. I saw it."
7,17,302,PAT,"Excuse me, are you an entertainer? Are you in showbusiness?"
7,17,302,GEORGE,"No, I uh..."
7,17,302,PAT,"Then what am I talking to you for? Jerry,"
7,17,303,JERRY,Alright.
7,17,305,GEORGE,"Wait a minute, wait a minute."
7,17,307,GEORGE,Look at that guy. Right there. Isn't that the guy from the show?
7,17,308,JERRY,"God, you're right."
7,17,308,GEORGE,C'mon.
7,17,310,MAITRE D',"Wait a second! Excuse me gentlemen, are you members?"
7,17,310,JERRY,"Well, I'm a prospective member."
7,17,310,MAITRE D',"Until then, that's the way out."
7,17,310,JERRY,But that guy has my jacket.
7,17,310,MAITRE D',"C'mon, let's go."
7,17,312,GEORGE,"Excuse me, the guy is wearing a jacket that my friend is..."
7,17,312,MAITRE D',Come on.
7,17,312,JERRY,Come on.
7,17,312,MAITRE D',Let's go.
7,17,312,GEORGE,If I could talk to the guy for just a sec...
