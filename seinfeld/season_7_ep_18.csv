7,18,0,THE WIG MASTER,Written by Spike Feresten
7,18,1,JERRY,"I really like the wig historically. I guess the revolutionary war, the last war fought in wig, and it seems that it must have been hard. You know they're going in to battle, they think.. well do I have my bullets? Do I have my bobby pins.. and you got to make sure you have everything... lot more to worry about What if I get killed.? Is my wig on straight? I don't know when the whole wig thing came in to style for men... but I know when it went out.! When the mirror was invented. No guy is looking in the mirror powdering a patch of horsehair on his head going ..All right! lets go rap to the ladies.."
7,18,2,JERRY,I'm looking for a crested blazer
7,18,2,CRAIG,A crested blazer..
7,18,2,JERRY,I've worn one once and I really think it did something for me.
7,18,2,CRAIG,: Yes .I Think we may have something.
7,18,5,JERRY,Hmm.. they'll match my sneakers.
7,18,5,CRAIG,It looks fabulous on you... shall I wrap it up?
7,18,5,JERRY,You know...I'm not sure. I'll tell you what. I'll come back later with someone and see what they think.
7,18,5,CRAIG,A Hum!
7,18,5,JERRY,Really I'll be back.
7,18,5,CRAIG,Yeah!
7,18,7,JERRY,"So I didn't like the crest all that much., but the guy spent fifteen minutes with me so to get out of the store I told I wanted to see what someone else thought.... And then he makes a face like he doesn't believe me."
7,18,7,ELAINE,Ah! So he knew that you were making it up!
7,18,7,JERRY,Yeah..... He caught me. So here's what I want you to do. Come back with me to the store and we'll pretend to look at the coat.
7,18,7,ELAINE,That's ridiculous. Why do do you want to go back there if you don't want the coat?
7,18,7,JERRY,Because he thinks I was lying and I want to show him I wasn't.
7,18,7,ELAINE,But you were!!
7,18,7,JERRY,"But if you go back with me, then I'm not."
7,18,7,GEORGE,All right fine.... Whatever
7,18,8,JERRY,Problems with the house guest?
7,18,8,ELAINE,What house guest?

7,18,8,KRAMER,Well Bob Sacamano he stayed with me once for a year and a half.
7,18,8,ELAINE,Who is he?
7,18,8,GEORGE,He's a wig master

7,18,8,JERRY,Boy.. imagine.. liking wigs to the point it becomes a career choice.
7,18,8,KRAMER,"About some tickets George, you know I'd kill for a peek.."
7,18,8,GEORGE,"Yeah, Sure, sure ,,, I got to drop my car off at the new lot."
7,18,8,KRAMER,Euh what...What lot is that?

7,18,64,GEORGE,You got hookers turning tricks in my car. How's that for starters.
7,18,64,ATTENDANT,Haaan! That is all hearsay.
7,18,64,GEORGE,"Allright, very good I'd like my car and my deposit back please"
7,18,64,ATTENDANT,Can't do it'
7,18,64,GEORGE,Whadday'mean.?

7,18,66,JERRY,........For spite...
7,18,66,TELLER,Spite?
7,18,66,JERRY,That's right. I don't care for the salesman that sold it to me.
7,18,66,TELLER,I don't think you can return an item for spite.
7,18,66,JERRY,What do you mean?
7,18,66,TELLER,"Well if there was some problem with the garment. If it were unsatisfactory in some way,then"
7,18,67,JERRY,"That's ridiculous, I want to return it. What's the difference what the reason is."
7,18,67,TELLER,Let me speak with the manager...excuse me .............Bob!
7,18,69,BOB,What seems to be the problem?
7,18,69,JERRY,Well I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she
7,18,70,BOB,That's true. You can't return an item based purely on spite.
7,18,70,JERRY,. Well So fine then ..then I don't want it and then that's why I'm returning it
7,18,70,BOB,Well you already said spite so......
7,18,70,JERRY,But I changed my mind..
7,18,70,BOB,No...you said spite...Too late.
