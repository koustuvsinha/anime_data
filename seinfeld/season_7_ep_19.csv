7,19,1,GEORGE,"I believe the doors on the bathroom stalls, here at the stadium, don't offer much by way of privacy. But I was thinking if we extend the doors all the way to the floors..."
7,19,1,MR. STEINBRENNER,All the way to the floor! What are you crazy! You'd suffocate in there. Your lucky you have any doors at all. You know when I was in the army... Hey Costanza. What's that your eating over there? It looks pretty tasty.
7,19,1,GEORGE,"It's a calzone, sir."
7,19,1,MR. STEINBRENNER,"A calzone huh. Pass it down here. Let's have a look at at it. I want a little taste. Come on, come on. Pass it down here. That's a good boy. Okay. What's in this thing?"
7,19,1,GEORGE,"Uh. Cheese, pepperoni, eggplant."
7,19,1,MR. STEINBRENNER,"Eggplant. Yes. That's a hell of a thing. Okay let's get back to business. Okay here you go. Very good, very good. Excellent. Excellent calzone you got there Costanza. Okay a little jealous now. Okay let's go. Ok last week.... You know that eggplant was very good. Everybody out. I got eggplant on my mind. Costanza get me couple of those calzones right now. Pronto. Move out. Big Stein wants an eggplant calzone. Must have one. Everybody out. Out."
7,19,2,ELAINE,One of those fabric wholesalers. This guy Todd Gack. I won a bet from him.
7,19,2,JERRY,What bet?
7,19,2,ELAINE,He bet me Dustin Hoffman was in Star Wars.
7,19,2,JERRY,Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars!?! Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader. I don't think so.
7,19,2,ELAINE,That's what I said.
7,19,2,JERRY,So the bet was that the loser has to buy dinner?
7,19,2,ELAINE,Yeah.
7,19,2,JERRY,Huh.
7,19,2,ELAINE,What?
7,19,2,JERRY,"No, nothing."
7,19,3,JERRY,What's with you?
7,19,3,KRAMER,Feel this.
7,19,3,JERRY,Wow.That's hot.
7,19,3,KRAMER,Yeah. It's piquing hot. It's fresh out of the dryer. Hey Elaine

7,19,5,JERRY,She's also quite bold.
7,19,5,KRAMER,Oh bold and beautiful.
7,19,6,MR. STEINBRENNER,I am loving this calzone. The pita pocket prevents it from dripping. The pita pocket. What is it Watson? A lost and found? No. I don't think we need that. If people keel over because they lost something that's there tough luck. You got a drip on your mouth by the way.
7,19,6,GEORGE,You know a lost and found could be a good idea.
7,19,6,MR. STEINBRENNER,Hold on Watson. You like lost and found George?
7,19,6,GEORGE,Definitely.
7,19,6,MR. STEINBRENNER,All right lost and found. But there's got to be a time limit. We're not running a pawn shop here.

7,19,9,TODD,Hey Jerry. Do you like cigars?
7,19,9,JERRY,Yeah. Why?
7,19,9,TODD,I am going to Montreal tomorrow and they sell them dirt cheap.

7,19,14,JERRY,With you two guys at the helm. The last piece of the puzzle is in
7,19,15,GEORGE,So let me ask you a question about the tip jar. I had a little
7,19,19,JERRY,So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind.
7,19,19,GEORGE,Not bills.
7,19,19,JERRY,So George. Remember when I told you Nikki gets whatever she wants.
7,19,21,GEORGE,Beautiful women. You know they could get away with murder. You
7,19,23,JERRY,She's like a beautiful Godzilla.
7,19,23,GEORGE,Without thousands of fleeing Japanese.
7,19,24,KRAMER,Hey buddy.
7,19,24,JERRY,What the hell is all this?
7,19,24,KRAMER,I am looking for quarters for the dryer.
7,19,24,JERRY,Why can't you do this on your table?
7,19,24,KRAMER,Because I don't have a table.

7,19,25,ELAINE,Huh. Yeah thanks for getting us tickets too.
7,19,25,JERRY,Oh!! Let me ask you a question. Was the movie part of the bet?
7,19,26,ELAINE,No. We were both in the mood for one.
7,19,26,JERRY,"You know Elaine, It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of"
7,19,27,ELAINE,Oh is that so.
7,19,27,JERRY,Absolutely. But I feel I must inform you that what happened last

7,19,28,JERRY,Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. He made a bet he knew he was
7,19,29,ELAINE,If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me.
7,19,29,JERRY,Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected. He has
7,19,30,ELAINE,I don't buy it.
7,19,31,JERRY,So what happened after the movie?
7,19,31,ELAINE,Nothing. He walked me home.
7,19,31,JERRY,To the door?
7,19,31,ELAINE,Yeah.
7,19,31,JERRY,That's a date.
7,19,31,ELAINE,No it's not.
7,19,31,JERRY,But I never walk you home.
7,19,31,ELAINE,That's just because your a jackass.
7,19,31,KRAMER,Ah!! I found a quarter. Anybody want there clothes heated up?
7,19,31,JERRY,"No, no."
7,19,31,ELAINE,"No, no."
7,19,31,JERRY,So how did you leave it with him?
7,19,31,ELAINE,I am supposed to meet him to pick up your cigars.
7,19,31,JERRY,That's another loop hole. That's two dates without asking you out.
7,19,31,ELAINE,Your crazy!
7,19,31,JERRY,Crazy like a man.
7,19,32,WORKER,Number 49.
7,19,32,GEORGE,You know my last name is Costanza. That's Italian. So you and I are
7,19,33,WORKER,$ 6.50 your change.

7,19,36,WORKER,Hey! You steal my money!!
7,19,36,GEORGE,No no. That's not what I was trying to do.
7,19,36,WORKER,I know what you try to do. Get out. Don't ever come back ever.
7,19,37,GEORGE,I got your calzones Mr. Steinbrenner.
7,19,37,MR. STEINBRENNER,Beautiful. I am starving George.
7,19,37,GEORGE,I thought tomorrow maybe we'd try a little corn beef.
7,19,37,MR. STEINBRENNER,Corn beef. I don't think so. It is a little fatty.
7,19,37,GEORGE,How about Chinese?
7,19,37,MR. STEINBRENNER,"Uhhhhh. No. Too many containers. Big mess, big mess."
7,19,39,GEORGE,I just thought it would be nice. A little variety.
7,19,39,MR. STEINBRENNER,"No, no, no. George let me tell you something. When I"
7,19,44,ELAINE,Thanks for the dinner.
7,19,44,TODD,Well I had to give these cigars and we were both hungry.

7,19,45,TODD,What?
7,19,45,ELAINE,I mean Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?
7,19,45,TODD,Elaine that was a legitimate bet and I lost so I bought you dinner.
7,19,45,ELAINE,"Oh all right. Okay well, goodnight."
7,19,45,TODD,"Hey, if your not doing anything Saturday do you want to meet somewhere"
7,19,45,ELAINE,See what is that? Is that a date?
7,19,45,TODD,Why can't two people go and do something without it being a date?
7,19,45,ELAINE,All right. I am sorry it's not a date.
7,19,45,TODD,No way. So I'll see you Saturday night?

7,19,46,JERRY,I was got to be 55.
7,19,46,POLICE OFFICER,That's right it is. Do you know how fast you were going?
7,19,46,JERRY,A lot faster than that!
7,19,46,POLICE OFFICER,Step out of the car sir.
7,19,46,JERRY,Okay dokey
7,19,46,POLICE OFFICER,Can I have your license and registration please?
7,19,46,JERRY,Absolutely. Nikki!
7,19,46,NIKKI,Yes.
7,19,46,JERRY,Would you mind bringing the officer the registration?
7,19,46,NIKKI,Not at all.
7,19,46,POLICE OFFICER,I got you on the radar at 93 miles per hour.
7,19,46,JERRY,You must have gotten me when I slowed down to take that curve because
7,19,47,NIKKI,Officer. Hi. Do you really have to give us a ticket?
7,19,47,JERRY,All right Nik. That's it.
7,19,48,KRAMER,Hey buddy. I am waiting for my shirt.
7,19,48,JERRY,You got your shirt in my oven!?!
7,19,48,KRAMER,I didn't have any quarters for the dryer. Anyway this is better.
7,19,49,JERRY,For both of us.
7,19,49,KRAMER,And I have a lot more control. I have one shirt going for 10 minutes
7,19,50,JERRY,What's wrong with your oven?
7,19,50,KRAMER,I am baking a pie!
7,19,51,JERRY,Yeah.
7,19,51,GEORGE,Yeah.
7,19,51,JERRY,Come on up.
7,19,51,KRAMER,"You got cigars, huh."
7,19,51,JERRY,I got some Cubans for George's wedding. They were more than I wanted
7,19,52,KRAMER,"Oh yeah baby. spit, spit. What are these? "" Perducto de Peru """
7,19,53,JERRY,Peru! I paid $300 bucks for these. I could have bought a house in
7,19,54,KRAMER,You got ripped buddy.
7,19,54,JERRY,I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuse
7,19,55,KRAMER,That's a nice name. Todd Gack. Is that Dutch?
7,19,58,GEORGE,Well this is bad. I am really in a bad situation now.
7,19,58,JERRY,so what is Steinbrenner going to do if he doesn't get his calzones?
7,19,58,GEORGE,What's he going to do? That's exactly the point. Nobody knows what
7,19,59,JERRY,Why don't you get someone else from the office to go get Pisano's for
7,19,60,GEORGE,Because before you know it he'll be having lunch with him. You know
7,19,61,JERRY,No. I never had a job.
7,19,62,KRAMER,I decided to go with the brown one 's.
7,19,62,GEORGE,What the hell is this?
7,19,62,JERRY,Kramer's cooking up some corduroy.
7,19,62,GEORGE,There has got to be some way to get back into Pisano's.
7,19,62,KRAMER,Pisano's. That's the place by the stadium right?
7,19,62,GEORGE,Yeah. You've heard of it?
7,19,62,KRAMER,Yeah. Newman raves about it. It's on his mail route. He goes by
7,19,63,GEORGE,I'll see you guys later.
7,19,63,JERRY,What kind of pie are you cooking?
7,19,63,KRAMER,Huckleberry.
7,19,64,NEWMAN,You certainly are in a bind.
7,19,64,GEORGE,Yeah. And since you go buy there everyday. I was hoping that we
7,19,65,NEWMAN,Oh well. Let me perfectly blunt. I don't care for you Costanza.
7,19,67,GEORGE,Are you going to help me or not?
7,19,67,NEWMAN,"All right, all right. I'll help you but I will except something in"
7,19,68,GEORGE,What?
7,19,68,NEWMAN,Well for starters I want a calzone of my own...
7,19,68,GEORGE,All right.
7,19,68,NEWMAN,And a slice of pepperoni pizza and a large soda and three times a
7,19,69,GEORGE,That's a little steep don't you think?
7,19,69,NEWMAN,You know I hear Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic. I would hate
7,19,70,GEORGE,"All right, all right."
7,19,70,NEWMAN,Do we have a deal?
7,19,70,GEORGE,But I have to have them by one o'clock. He's very regiment about his
7,19,71,NEWMAN,I know exactly how he feels. Pleasure doing business with you. Do
7,19,73,ELAINE,This is nice.
7,19,73,TODD,Gack. Party of four.

7,19,73,ELAINE,Hellllllooooo.
7,19,74,MOM,Nice meeting you.
7,19,74,TODD,Bye mom.
7,19,74,MOM,She's wonderful.
7,19,74,ELAINE,What the hell was that?
7,19,74,TODD,What?
7,19,74,ELAINE,Why did you introduce me to your parents?
7,19,74,TODD,There nice people. I thought you would like them.
7,19,74,ELAINE,"Come on Todd. Admit it, this is a date."
7,19,74,TODD,Why is this a date?
7,19,74,ELAINE,Saturday night with your parents. Unless I'm your sister this is a
7,19,75,TODD,Elaine. I don't understand why you can't meet someone else's parents
7,19,76,ELAINE,Well if it's not a date then what is it?
7,19,76,TODD,It's a lovely evening together.
7,19,76,ELAINE,I don't believe this.

7,19,79,GEORGE,"You don't work in the rain? Your a mailman. "" Neither rain nor sleet"
7,19,80,NEWMAN,I was never that big on creeds.
7,19,80,GEORGE,You were supposed to deliver my calzones. We had a deal!
7,19,80,NEWMAN,I believe the deal was that I get the calzones on my mail route.
7,19,81,GEORGE,But I'm paying you!
7,19,81,NEWMAN,Yes thank you.
7,19,81,GEORGE,Newman!!
7,19,82,NIKKI,Peru? I thought you wanted cigars from Cuba?
7,19,82,JERRY,I did.
7,19,82,NIKKI,Well if these aren't what you wanted then why did you pay him?
7,19,82,JERRY,Well what could I do? Unless you pay him a visit.
7,19,82,NIKKI,Okay.
7,19,84,GEORGE,Kramer!
7,19,84,KRAMER,Hey you!
7,19,84,GEORGE,Look I need you to do me a favor. I need you to get me lunch at
7,19,85,KRAMER,What happened to Newman?
7,19,85,GEORGE,He called in sick.
7,19,85,KRAMER,Oh yeah right it's raining.
7,19,85,GEORGE,Can you do it?
7,19,85,KRAMER,What time do you need it at?
7,19,85,GEORGE,1:00 p.m. Do you need any money?
7,19,85,KRAMER,No. I got eight tons of change. I'm loaded.
7,19,86,KRAMER,Hey hold that bus!
7,19,87,KRAMER,Hey. It's really wet out there.
7,19,87,WORKER,What can I get you?
7,19,87,KRAMER,I here you make a pretty mean calzone.
7,19,87,WORKER,Calzone!
7,19,87,KRAMER,Yeah calzone.
7,19,87,WORKER,The best!
7,19,87,KRAMER,All right. Lay them on me. I'll take three.
7,19,87,WORKER,Three calzones.
7,19,87,KRAMER,Hey. That's a big oven. Huh. Listen. I was wondering if you could
7,19,89,ELAINE,Hey Todd.
7,19,89,TODD,Hi. You know Nikki.
7,19,90,NIKKI,"Wait. Elaine will settle this. What's the ""M"" stand for in Richard"
7,19,91,ELAINE,Milhouse.
7,19,91,NIKKI,I told you so. He said it was Moe. You owe me a dinner.
7,19,92,WORKER,Your order is ready. Three calzones and one shirt and jacket.
7,19,92,KRAMER,Oh. This is all burned up. Look at this.
7,19,92,WORKER,What the hell do I know about cooking a shirt? What the hell is
7,19,93,KRAMER,That's all I got.
7,19,93,WORKER,No. You have to have bills. Paper money. You can't pay with this.
7,19,93,KRAMER,I told you this is all I got.
7,19,93,WORKER,Then no calzones.
7,19,95,GEORGE,What happened? Where have you been?
7,19,95,KRAMER,The guy wouldn't give them to me because I wanted to pay in change.
7,19,95,GEORGE,What the hell happened to your shirt?
7,19,95,KRAMER,He overcooked it. It's ruined.
7,19,95,GEORGE,Your clothes smell just like Pisano's. There's another Italian place
7,19,103,JERRY,Stupid cigars. You know if I didn't send Nikki over to talk to him
7,19,104,ELAINE,These are terrible.
7,19,104,JERRY,It's like trying to smoke a chicken bone.
7,19,104,ELAINE,What kind of a name is Todd Gack anyway.
7,19,104,JERRY,I think it's Dutch. I got to get going.
7,19,104,ELAINE,Where are you going?
7,19,104,JERRY,
7,19,104,ELAINE,But she broke up with you.
7,19,104,JERRY,"I know, I know. But some how she explained it to me and I couldn't"
7,19,105,ELAINE,It smells like a rubber fire.
7,19,105,JERRY,What's that?
7,19,105,ELAINE,I said rubber fire.
7,19,105,JERRY,Oh.
7,19,105,ELAINE,Did you ever pay Todd for these things?
7,19,105,JERRY,Actually it's being taken care of right now.
7,19,107,KRAMER,You Gack?
7,19,107,TODD,Yeah.
7,19,107,KRAMER,Here's your money.
7,19,109,MR. STEINBRENNER,George. Why do these clothes smell like Pisano's?
7,19,109,GEORGE,Because they were heated up there.
7,19,109,MR. STEINBRENNER,Heating up your clothes? That's not a bad idea.
7,19,109,THE END,
