7,2,1,GEORGE,"And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine."
7,2,1,ELAINE,"I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing."
7,2,1,GEORGE,"Ya know, I was just a little surprised."
7,2,1,JERRY,Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer that?
7,2,1,GEORGE,What about all the loser stuff?
7,2,1,ELAINE,"I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said ""I've never seen you looser""."
7,2,1,JERRY,"I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit it's available, it's there, it's 2 aisles over."
7,2,1,GEORGE,"Well, scintillating as always."
7,2,1,JERRY,Where you going?
7,2,1,GEORGE,I'm going shopping with Susan.
7,2,1,ELAINE,What kind of shopping?
7,2,1,GEORGE,Clothes shopping.
7,2,1,ELAINE,Where are you going?
7,2,1,GEORGE,Ross'.
7,2,1,ELAINE,Oh that's a nice store.
7,2,1,GEORGE,"Yeah, it's her uncle's."
7,2,1,JERRY,Discount?
7,2,1,GEORGE,One would hope.
7,2,3,KRAMER,"So ya know, my friend and I we were going to the movies and we stopped off"
7,2,4,JACKIE,Hm Hm. Oh what is that like Italian coffee?
7,2,4,KRAMER,Yeah that's right.
7,2,4,JACKIE,"Half milk, half coffee?"
7,2,4,KRAMER,Yeah.
7,2,4,JACKIE,Hm Hm. You take a sip?
7,2,4,KRAMER,Yes I did.
7,2,4,JACKIE,"Now when you took a sip, did you notice it was hot? Were you able to sip"
7,2,5,KRAMER,No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal fashion.
7,2,5,JACKIE,"Hm Hm. All right, all right. You take big sips?"
7,2,5,KRAMER,Well I think I take a normal sip.
7,2,5,JACKIE,
7,2,5,KRAMER,"Well you know ahh, they don't allow outside drinks in the movie theater."
7,2,6,JACKIE,"Yeah, see they like to sell their own coffee."
7,2,6,KRAMER,"Yeah, now is that going to be a problem?"
7,2,6,JACKIE,Yeah that's going to be a problem. It's gonna be a problem for them.
7,2,8,KRAMER,It's definitely preposterous.
7,2,8,JACKIE,So. Then what happened?
7,2,8,KRAMER,Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step over someone and
7,2,9,JACKIE,Was there a top on it?
7,2,9,KRAMER,Yeah.
7,2,9,JACKIE,Now did you put the top on or did they put the top on for you?
7,2,9,KRAMER,No. They put the top on.
7,2,9,JACKIE,And they made the top. You didn't make the top did you?
7,2,10,JACKIE,Suzie. I want you to go down to Java World.
7,2,12,KRAMER,"Ah No no, I haven't."
7,2,12,JACKIE,Suzie. Call Dr. Bison. Set up an appointment
7,2,13,KRAMER,"So ah, what do you think Mr. Chiles."
7,2,13,JACKIE,Jackie.
7,2,13,KRAMER,"Jackie. I mean, we have a chance?"
7,2,13,JACKIE,"Do we have a chance? You get me one coffee drinker on that jury, you"
7,2,16,GEORGE,"I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy."
7,2,16,SUSAN,Well you could use a little flash.
7,2,16,GEORGE,All right. Don't change me. Susan. Don't change me. Ya know there are a lot
7,2,17,SUSAN,Name one.
7,2,17,MR ROSS,"So, you find anything?"
7,2,17,SUSAN,"Oh, he's impossible to shop for uncle Ned."
7,2,17,MR ROSS,I'm going on vacation to Costa Rica. Maybe I'll see you in a couple of
7,2,18,SALESMAN,Excuse me Mr Ross.
7,2,19,GEORGE,See now this I don't get.
7,2,19,SUSAN,What?
7,2,19,GEORGE,The security guard.
7,2,19,SUSAN,What about him?
7,2,19,GEORGE,Why does he have to stand?
7,2,19,SUSAN,Because he's a security guard.
7,2,19,GEORGE,But I mean look at him. He's gotta be on his feet like that all day?
7,2,20,SUSAN,"George, you just met him. Don't say anything to him."
7,2,20,GEORGE,Aren't you concerned about the security guard?
7,2,20,SUSAN,Not really.
7,2,20,GEORGE,She's not concerned about the security guard. What
7,2,22,SUSAN,All right George. What do you
7,2,24,JERRY,"So ah, what did you do last night?"
7,2,24,ELAINE,Nothing.
7,2,24,JERRY,"I know nothing, but what did you actually do?"
7,2,24,ELAINE,Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared.
7,2,24,JERRY,Wow. That really is nothing.
7,2,24,ELAINE,I told ya.
7,2,25,KRAMER,Hey.
7,2,25,JERRY,Hey.
7,2,25,ELAINE,Hey.
7,2,25,JERRY,What are you all dressed up for?
7,2,25,KRAMER,Oh I ah just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
7,2,25,JERRY,"Oh yeah, how's that looking?"
7,2,25,KRAMER,Oh I'll tell you how it's looking. My lawyer Jackie says if there is one
7,2,26,ELAINE,That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote?
7,2,27,KRAMER,"Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have weeded you out."
7,2,27,JERRY,Frankly I'm surprised you're so litigious.
7,2,27,KRAMER,Oh I can be quite litigious.
7,2,27,ELAINE,What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company because there
7,2,28,KRAMER,Yeah but Jackie says the top was faulty.
7,2,28,ELAINE,Jackie says the top was faulty.
7,2,29,KRAMER,Hey Maestro!
7,2,29,MAESTRO,"Ah, Kramer."
7,2,29,KRAMER,I'm in here. How's it going.
7,2,29,MAESTRO,Fine.
7,2,29,JERRY,Hi Bob.
7,2,30,JERRY,"Oh, I'm sorry. Maestro."
7,2,30,KRAMER,"Well, this is a surprise ha?"
7,2,30,MAESTRO,I just wanted to drop off this Chinese balm for your burns. It's supposed
7,2,31,KRAMER,"Oh Maestro, you, what are you doing? You don't have to do this. Do you"
7,2,32,MAESTRO,It's nothing.
7,2,32,KRAMER,"Yeah, ya know you haven't been around for a while."
7,2,32,MAESTRO,"Oh yeah, I've been at my house in Tuscany."
7,2,32,KRAMER,Oh Tuscany huh? Hear that Jerry? That's in Italy.
7,2,32,JERRY,I hear it's ah beautiful there.
7,2,32,MAESTRO,Well if you're thinking of getting a place there don't bother. There's
7,2,33,JERRY,Huh?
7,2,34,MAESTRO,Oh!
7,2,34,ELAINE,Hello.
7,2,34,MAESTRO,Well Hello. And who might you be?
7,2,34,ELAINE,I might be Elaine.
7,2,34,JERRY,"This is a, Bob Cobb."
7,2,34,KRAMER,Maestro.
7,2,34,ELAINE,"Oh, Maestro."
7,2,34,MAESTRO,It is my very great pleasure.
7,2,34,ELAINE,Enchante.
7,2,34,MAESTRO AND ELAINE,Well I have to be going.
7,2,34,ELAINE,Jinx buy me a coke.
7,2,34,MAESTRO,Oh. Love it when that happeneds.
7,2,34,ELAINE,I know I know. That is so ahh ......
7,2,34,MAESTRO,Coincidental.
7,2,34,ELAINE,"Yeah, thanks. O.K. Bye you guys."
7,2,34,MAESTRO,Ciao.
7,2,35,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah oh hey and a thanks for the balm. Yeah."
7,2,36,KRAMER,You know you hurt the Maestro's feelings.
7,2,36,JERRY,"Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?"
7,2,36,KRAMER,That's right.
7,2,36,JERRY,Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro.
7,2,36,KRAMER,Why?
7,2,36,JERRY,Because it's a stupid thing to be called.
7,2,36,KRAMER,Jerry he's a conductor.
7,2,36,JERRY,Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association Orchestra.
7,2,36,KRAMER,"Well, he's still a conductor."
7,2,36,JERRY,Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine.
7,2,36,KRAMER,"Oh, you should see him do 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'."
7,2,38,JERRY,New shirt?
7,2,38,GEORGE,Yeah. You like it.
7,2,38,JERRY,"No, not particularly."
7,2,38,GEORGE,"Why, the color?"
7,2,38,JERRY,Yeah.
7,2,38,GEORGE,Too flashy?
7,2,38,JERRY,"Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right?"
7,2,38,GEORGE,No.
7,2,38,JERRY,All right what's it going to be here.
7,2,38,GEORGE,"Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does it bother you"
7,2,39,JERRY,No.
7,2,39,GEORGE,"See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different. I can sense"
7,2,40,JERRY,Are you sensing anything right now?
7,2,40,GEORGE,"Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in"
7,2,41,JERRY,"Well, what about criminal activity? He's got to be alert."
7,2,41,GEORGE,"What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that take?"
7,2,43,JERRY,Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.
7,2,43,GEORGE,Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair? I would be
7,2,45,JERRY,I know you will.
7,2,46,KRAMER,"Hey, hey, hey, listen to this. Jackie just called."
7,2,46,GEORGE,Who?
7,2,46,JERRY,His lawyer.
7,2,46,KRAMER,"Yeah, Java World wants to settle."
7,2,46,JERRY,What?
7,2,46,KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm gonna be rich."
7,2,46,JERRY,Why are they settling?
7,2,46,KRAMER,Cause their afraid of bad publicity.
7,2,46,JERRY,All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?
7,2,46,KRAMER,Yeah that's right.
7,2,46,GEORGE,I'm gonna need a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling!
7,2,47,MAESTRO,And then about four years ago I was on holiday in Tuscany.
7,2,47,ELAINE,Uh ha.
7,2,47,MAESTRO,And I fell in love with this house.
7,2,48,WAITER,Are you ready to order?
7,2,48,ELAINE,Oh God. What are you getting Bob?
7,2,49,MAESTRO,Good question. We'll need a few minutes.
7,2,50,MAESTRO,"You know, I'm sorry but, I didn't mention it earlier but actually I"
7,2,51,ELAINE,Excuse me?
7,2,51,MAESTRO,"Well, ya know I am a conductor."
7,2,51,ELAINE,"Yeah, so?"
7,2,51,MAESTRO,Oh I suppose it's O.K. for Leonard Burnstein to be called Maestro because
7,2,52,ELAINE,"Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he"
7,2,54,MAESTRO,"I happen to know for a fact, that he was called Maestro in social"
7,2,56,ELAINE,Maestro huh? O.K.
7,2,58,KRAMER,Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry my burn is gone look..
7,2,58,JERRY,What do you mean?
7,2,58,KRAMER,"Well I put that Chinese balm on that the Maestro gave me. And look, it"
7,2,59,JERRY,So?
7,2,59,KRAMER,So? My lawsuit. I'm finished.
7,2,59,JERRY,I thought they wanted to settle.
7,2,59,KRAMER,Well what happens if they want to see it?
7,2,59,JERRY,Then you're in a lot of trouble.
7,2,59,KRAMER,Yeah!!
7,2,60,GEORGE,Tired?
7,2,60,GUARD,No.
7,2,60,GEORGE,"How come uh, no chair?"
7,2,60,GUARD,What?
7,2,60,GEORGE,
7,2,60,GUARD,I don't need a chair.
7,2,60,GEORGE,No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously a very well
7,2,61,GUARD,Nope.
7,2,61,GEORGE,Would you like a chair?
7,2,61,GUARD,I suppose if they gave me one I'd sit down.
7,2,61,GEORGE,"Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?"
7,2,61,GUARD,"Obviously I'd rather sit than stand, if that's what your asking."
7,2,61,GEORGE,That's exactly my point.
7,2,61,GUARD,Well who wouldn't?
7,2,61,GEORGE,"Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear one day and find"
7,2,64,JACKIE,You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didn't tell you
7,2,66,KRAMER,I guess I screwed up huh Jackie?
7,2,66,JACKIE,Your damn right you screwed up. Where the hell did you get that damm balm
7,2,67,KRAMER,The Maestro.
7,2,67,JACKIE,The who? What are you talking about Maestro?
7,2,67,KRAMER,My friend he's a conductor.
7,2,67,JACKIE,"Oh oh oh, so a Maestro tells you to put a balm on and you do it?"
7,2,67,KRAMER,Well my stomach was burning.
7,2,67,JACKIE,I tell you what this is. This is a public humiliation.
7,2,67,KRAMER,Well I didn't know the balm was gonna work.
7,2,67,JACKIE,Do you know what a balm is? Have you ever seen a balm? Didn't you read
7,2,68,KRAMER,Well I ...
7,2,68,JACKIE,No one can tell what a balm's gonna do. They're unpredictable.
7,2,68,KRAMER,I'm sorry Jackie.
7,2,68,JACKIE,Pull over here driver this is it.
7,2,68,KRAMER,"Yeah, get over."
7,2,69,JERRY,Did you have a good time?
7,2,69,ELAINE,"Yeah, he's very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died while he was"
7,2,70,JERRY,"Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus."
7,2,70,ELAINE,Really?
7,2,70,JERRY,"So what about the ""Maestro"" stuff. Did he make you call him Maestro."
7,2,70,ELAINE,"Yeah, I called him Maestro."
7,2,70,JERRY,You didn't mind?
7,2,70,ELAINE,"Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it."
7,2,70,JERRY,
7,2,70,ELAINE,"I am not calling you ""Jerry the Great""."
7,2,70,JERRY,Why not you call him Maestro.
7,2,70,ELAINE,He is a Maestro.
7,2,70,JERRY,"Well, I'm great."
7,2,70,ELAINE,So you say.
7,2,70,JERRY,"What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?"
7,2,70,ELAINE,Yeah. I'm invited.
7,2,70,JERRY,"You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of the clear blue sky"
7,2,71,ELAINE,Why?
7,2,71,JERRY,I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.
7,2,71,ELAINE,"Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there."
7,2,71,JERRY,In all of Tuscany? I wonder.
7,2,72,MR STAR,"I say we offer him $50,000 that's it, take it or leave it."
7,2,72,MR BURNS,How do we know how severe the burns are? Why don't we have him
7,2,73,MS. JORDAN,"Listen, the faster we dispose of this the better. This thing gets into"
7,2,74,MR STAR,"All right, we'll start at 50,000 and free coffee at all of our stores."
7,2,75,MR STAR,Yes?
7,2,76,SECRETARY,Mr. Chiles and Mr. Kramer are here.
7,2,77,MR STAR,Send them in.
7,2,78,MR STAR,Gentleman.
7,2,79,MR STAR,Gentleman come in. Now we don't want to take up much of your time. Let's
7,2,81,KRAMER,
7,2,82,JACKIE,I'll take it? Who told you to take it? Did I tell you to take it?
7,2,82,KRAMER,No.
7,2,82,JACKIE,"I know the Maestro didn't tell you to take it, he wasn't there."
7,2,82,KRAMER,Well I thought we were lucky to get anything.
7,2,82,JACKIE,Free coffee?
7,2,82,KRAMER,Yeah.
7,2,82,JACKIE,I don't want free coffee. It's not hard to get coffee. I can get my own
7,2,83,KRAMER,Well I didn't hear any Plus.
7,2,83,JACKIE,20 years practicing law I've never experienced anything like this.
7,2,84,KRAMER,"Look, Java World. Hey listen I'm gonna get out here. I'm"
7,2,87,ELAINE,Hey. Hi Maestro.
7,2,88,MAESTRO,Beethoven's 7th.
7,2,88,ELAINE,Yeah.
7,2,88,JERRY,Hey you know we were just talking about you.
7,2,88,MAESTRO,Oh yeah?
7,2,88,JERRY,"Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses"
7,2,89,MAESTRO,"You didn't find one, did you?"
7,2,89,JERRY,No. I'm not really looking.
7,2,89,MAESTRO,Nor should you.
7,2,89,JERRY,So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all of Tuscany?
7,2,89,MAESTRO,"The houses are passed down from generation to generation, it's very hard."
7,2,89,JERRY,"I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?"
7,2,89,MAESTRO,It's booked solid!
7,2,89,ELAINE,It's BOOKED Jerry!
7,2,89,JERRY,How'd you get yours?
7,2,89,MAESTRO,"Got lucky. Come on, Elaine, let's take a ride, I was about to pop in some"
7,2,91,JERRY,Maybe I'll check out France.
7,2,92,JERRY,"Hey George, do you believe this guy?"
7,2,92,GEORGE,Who?
7,2,92,JERRY,Bob Cobb.
7,2,92,GEORGE,Bob Cobb?
7,2,92,JERRY,"You know, the Maestro."
7,2,92,GEORGE,Oh I missed the Maestro?
7,2,92,JERRY,"Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where in Tuscany to rent."
7,2,92,GEORGE,Huh. Your renting a house in Tuscany?
7,2,92,JERRY,No.
7,2,92,GEORGE,So what do you care?
7,2,94,JERRY,I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of
7,2,95,GEORGE,Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. Do you
7,2,96,JERRY,I have no idea.
7,2,96,GEORGE,It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.
7,2,96,JERRY,"Oh, no way it's that big."
7,2,96,GEORGE,It's a big region.
7,2,96,JERRY,Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?
7,2,96,GEORGE,I don't know why I bother even talking to you.
7,2,96,JERRY,"Hey, no one's got a gun to your head."
7,2,96,GEORGE,All right.
7,2,97,GEORGE,So I spoke to the security guard.
7,2,97,JERRY,Yeah and?
7,2,97,GEORGE,"Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair,"
7,2,98,JERRY,So are you gonna get him a chair?
7,2,98,GEORGE,Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool.
7,2,98,JERRY,"Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out. With a"
7,2,99,GEORGE,Oh I think I'd go for the back.
7,2,99,JERRY,Swivel?
7,2,99,GEORGE,I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's chairs. What
7,2,100,JERRY,I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents used to have a
7,2,101,GEORGE,You mean one of those vinyl things?
7,2,101,JERRY,Yes.
7,2,101,GEORGE,"Vinyl yeah, maybe."
7,2,101,JERRY,How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany? Wait a
7,2,103,GEORGE,"Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside."
7,2,105,JERRY,"Poppy told me to talk to his cousin, he lives down in Little Italy."
7,2,105,GEORGE,What do you think about a rocking chair?
7,2,106,KRAMER,"You can't put a limit on my cafe lattes,"
7,2,110,JERRY,"Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?"
7,2,110,KRAMER,Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of cafe lattes. But I'm
7,2,111,JERRY,That's it?
7,2,111,KRAMER,That's it. What you want one George? I can get one for you. No problem.
7,2,112,JERRY,You've got to stop it. Your your all hopped up on the caffein.
7,2,112,KRAMER,Well I feel like I'm talking fast but it's very hard to tell.
7,2,112,JERRY,You're racing!
7,2,112,KRAMER,Well well I've got things to do. I'll see you later. Bye.
7,2,115,ELAINE,Oh Bob! Bob!

7,2,118,GEOGE,"Nope. Just a, giving a chair to the security guard."
7,2,118,CLERK,Did Mr. Ross tell you to do this?
7,2,119,GEORGE,What's your name?
7,2,119,CLERK,Evan Fayne.
7,2,119,GEORGE,I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking over this
7,2,120,CLERK,"I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know."
7,2,120,GEORGE,Innocent mistake.
7,2,121,GEORGE,"Well, here you go. What do you think?"
7,2,121,GUARD,Mr. Ross says this is O.K.?
7,2,121,GEORGE,"Hey, I'm his nephew, all right? Don't worry about it. Go ahead. Check it out."
7,2,122,GUARD,Not bad. Not bad at all.
7,2,123,JERRY,"Ah, excuse me, I'm looking for a Mr. Giggio."
7,2,123,GIGGIO,"Si, Si, imma Giggio."

7,2,123,GIGGIO,"Si, the house in Tuscana."
7,2,123,JERRY,"Yeah, right, right. So is there anything there to rent?"
7,2,123,GIGGIO,Si. Two million lira. You give me the check.
7,2,123,JERRY,I didn't actually want to rent it.
7,2,123,GIGGIO,"The keys, here are the keys. You give me the check. Two million"
7,2,125,GIGGIO,"Si, Si."
7,2,126,JERRY,"So see um, I didn't say that I wanted to rent it, I was just wondering if"
