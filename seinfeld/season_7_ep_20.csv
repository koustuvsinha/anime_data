7,20,0,THE BOTTLE DEPOSIT PART 1,Written by Gregg Kavet & Andy Robin
7,20,1,JERRY,"I love it when you get your car back from the car place, and it's got that paper mat on the floor. Like they're so obsessed with cleanliness, they don't even want their shoes to touch the carpet. Meanwhile, the mechanic comes out; he looks like Al Jolson. He's covered in goo, from head to toe. You can't even see him. Although, I prefer that to when they have the lab coat, The clipboard and the nice glasses. Now you know you're getting screwed. 'Can I see it?' 'You better not. It's idling quietly right now. I think it should stay overnight. We wanna keep an eye on it, and we wanna keep the bill running up.'"
7,20,5,WILHELM,And you can tell the players that I reimburse the trainer for
7,20,6,GEORGE,"Sorry, the players will be reimbursed?"
7,20,6,WILHELM,"The trainer, George. Tell the players I'll reimburse the trainer. What's the matter with you? This is the third time I've had to repeat myself."
7,20,6,GEORGE,"Sorry, Mr Wilhelm."
7,20,6,WILHELM,"Look, sorry doesn't cut it. We're running a ball club here"
7,20,7,GEORGE,"I know, sir. It won't happen again."
7,20,7,WILHELM,"Lemme see, I uh, I had an assignment for you... uh."

7,20,13,ELAINE,The pygmy pullover.
7,20,13,PETERMAN,Sotheby's is having an auction of JFK's memorabilia. One item
7,20,15,ELAINE,Whatever.

7,20,17,ELAINE,"Oh. Oh yeah, I'd be happy to. Uhm, how much"
7,20,19,PETERMAN,"I would see no trouble in spending up to, say, ten thousand"

7,20,32,GEORGE,No kidding?
7,20,32,JERRY,Oh yeah. He'd hold national security meetings in there. He
7,20,33,GEORGE,"Well, I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't even"
7,20,34,JERRY,Ask him to repeat it. Tell him there was an echo in there.
7,20,34,GEORGE,I can't. He's been on my case about not paying attention.
7,20,35,JERRY,You know what you do? Ask him a follow-up question. Tell him
7,20,36,GEORGE,"Yeah, follow-up question, that'll work."

7,20,118,JERRY,"No, I hadn't noticed."
7,20,118,TONY,Have you been picking at it?
7,20,118,JERRY,Have I been picking at it? No. You know. It's just wear and

7,20,232,ELAINE,"Listen, I need to come over and pick up the clubs for Peterman."
7,20,232,JERRY,"Oh, you know what?"
7,20,232,ELAINE,Oh no. What?
7,20,232,JERRY,"Oh, no. It's no big deal. I left the clubs in the car."
7,20,232,ELAINE,You left them in the car? How could you leave them in the car?
7,20,232,JERRY,I forgot.
7,20,232,ELAINE,"Oh, go down and get them."
7,20,232,JERRY,I can't. The car's at the mechanics.
7,20,232,ELAINE,"Ah, this is great. Alright, well, where is the mechanic? I'll just go and pick 'em up myself."
7,20,232,JERRY,"No, no, you can't. He's working on the car right now. You can not disturb him while he's working. But I'm going down there in like an hour, if you wanna meet me down there. You know the place, it's on fifty-sixth street?"
7,20,232,ELAINE,"Ugh, okay, alright, fine."
7,20,234,JERRY,"Hey, Tony."
7,20,234,TONY,"Thanks for coming in, Jerry."
7,20,234,JERRY,Sure.
7,20,234,TONY,"I think I know what's goin' on here, and I just wanna hear it from you. But I want you to be straight with me. Don't lie to me, Jerry. You know that motor oil you're puttin' in there? From one of those quicky lube places, isn't it?"
7,20,234,JERRY,"Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down here..."
7,20,234,TONY,"Jerry, motor oil is the lifeblood of a car. Okay, you put in a low-grade oil, you could damage vital engine parts. Okay. See this gasket? I have no confidence in that gasket."
7,20,234,JERRY,I really wanna...
7,20,234,TONY,"Here's what I wanna do. I wanna overhaul the entire engine. But it's gonna take a major commitment from you. You're gonna have to keep it under sixty miles an hour for a while. You gotta come in, and you gotta get the oil changed every thousand miles."
7,20,234,JERRY,How much money is this gonna cost me?
7,20,234,TONY,"Huh. I don't understand you. It's your own car we're Talking about. You know you wrote the wrong mileage down on the form? You barely know the car. You don't know the mileage, you don't know the tyre pressure. When was the last time you even checked the washer fluid?"
7,20,234,JERRY,The washer fluid is fine.
7,20,234,TONY,The washer fluid is not fine!
7,20,234,JERRY,"Alright, you know what, uhm... I just wanna take my car, and I'm gonna bring it someplace else."
7,20,234,TONY,What d'you mean?
7,20,234,JERRY,"Just, can I have my car? I wanna pay my bill, I'm gonna be on my way."
7,20,234,TONY,"Well, the car's on a lift."
7,20,234,JERRY,"Well, just get it down."
7,20,234,TONY,"Alright. Okay. Well, uhm, wait here and I'll uh, I'll bring it around."
7,20,234,JERRY,"Okay. Thank you, very much."
7,20,235,ELAINE,Hey. Where's the car?
7,20,235,JERRY,He's bringing it.
7,20,235,ELAINE,Good.
