7,21,2,JERRY,"Okay, thank you."
7,21,2,ELAINE,So? What'd they say?
7,21,2,JERRY,They're sending a detective to my apartment tomorrow.
7,21,2,ELAINE,What the hell were you thinking leaving my clubs in that car?!
7,21,2,JERRY,"Well, I didn't count on my mechanic pulling a Mary-Beth"
7,21,3,ELAINE,What kind of maniac is this guy?
7,21,3,JERRY,He's a very special maniac.
7,21,3,ELAINE,What am I supposed to tell Mr Peterman.
7,21,3,JERRY,I don't know.
7,21,3,ELAINE,Why couldn't you take better care of that car?!
7,21,5,PETERMAN,"Well, are they here?"
7,21,5,ELAINE,"Mr Peterman, uh... There seems to be a bit of a snag."
7,21,5,PETERMAN,Snag?
7,21,5,ELAINE,It seems that a psychotic mechanic has absconded with my
7,21,6,PETERMAN,What does that have to do with my clubs?
7,21,6,ELAINE,They happened to be in the back seat at the time.
7,21,8,DETECTIVE,What was the suspect wearing at the time of the incident?
7,21,8,JERRY,"You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'. Lemme"
7,21,9,DETECTIVE,"All the time. A mechanic forms an emotional attachment,"
7,21,12,JERRY,Had I been taking...?
7,21,12,DETECTIVE,"Well, did you leave the A/C on? Do you zip over speed bumps?"
7,21,13,JERRY,"W-well, what does it matter? It's my car, I can do whatever I"
7,21,15,JERRY,Not that I would think of doing such things.
7,21,15,DETECTIVE,"Alright Mr Seinfeld, we'll let you know if"
7,21,16,JERRY,"Well uh, whatever you can do. Thanks."
7,21,19,GEORGE,"Uh, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, about the project..."
7,21,19,WILHELM,That's what I came to talk to you about. Great job George.
7,21,20,GEORGE,I did?
7,21,20,WILHELM,"Oh yes, I read through it this morning. I couldn't have done"
7,21,25,JERRY,"I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow"
7,21,26,GEORGE,Maybe somebody did it and didn't take credit for it. Maybe it
7,21,32,WILHELM,"The gardener did a nice job planting the rose bushes, didn't"
7,21,33,MRS WILHELM,"You planted the rose bushes, dear."
7,21,33,WILHELM,I did?
7,21,33,MRS WILHELM,Yesterday. You remember.
7,21,33,WILHELM,That's right. What's for dinner?
7,21,33,MRS WILHELM,We just ate. Did you forget to take your medicine?
7,21,36,GEORGE,"The point is, however it got done, it's done. So, any luck with"
7,21,37,JERRY,No. The police have no leads and I
7,21,38,GEORGE,Why not?
7,21,38,JERRY,"They don't consider it stolen, if you wilfully give the guy the"
7,21,40,ELAINE,Hey.
7,21,40,GEORGE,Hey.
7,21,40,ELAINE,Hey. What did the detective say?
7,21,40,JERRY,They're looking.
7,21,40,GEORGE,I gotta go.
7,21,41,JERRY,Y'hello.
7,21,41,DETECTIVE,Mr Seinfeld?
7,21,41,JERRY,Yeah.
7,21,41,DETECTIVE,It's Detective McMahon...
7,21,42,DETECTIVE,"...I'm at the warehouse on Pier 38. Ah, I think you'd"
7,21,43,JERRY,"Yeah, okay. They may have found the car."
7,21,43,ELAINE,Are the clubs in it? Ask him.
7,21,43,JERRY,Are there golf clubs in the back?
7,21,43,DETECTIVE,We really can't tell. You better bring your service
7,21,49,YOUNG COP,Watch where you step. There's quite a bit of... grease.
7,21,50,DETECTIVE,How d'you do. Thanks for coming down.
7,21,50,JERRY,This is Elaine Benes.
7,21,50,ELAINE,"We used to date, but now we're just friends."
7,21,50,DETECTIVE,I see.
7,21,50,JERRY,Yeah.
7,21,50,DETECTIVE,"I'm sorry to make you go through this, but we need to make"
7,21,51,JERRY,"Well, what's going on? What is this thing?"
7,21,51,DETECTIVE,One of our patrolmen stumbled over this.
7,21,52,ELAINE,Huuh!
7,21,52,JERRY,Oh my God!
7,21,53,DETECTIVE,The block is nearly split apart. We found the overhead cams
7,21,54,ELAINE,"Oh, my God."
7,21,54,DETECTIVE,And we know it's a Saab. The angle on the Vee-6 is
7,21,56,JERRY,What is that smell?
7,21,56,DETECTIVE,Look at the clutch.
7,21,57,ELAINE,Uuh.
7,21,58,YOUNG COP,Excuse me.
7,21,58,DETECTIVE,"Whoever did this didn't just dismantle it. I mean, they took"
7,21,61,ELAINE,Uhh
7,21,61,JERRY,Wait a second. Turbo? I didn't have a turbo.
7,21,61,DETECTIVE,Your car's not a turbo?
7,21,61,JERRY,"No, it's a nine-hundred S. It's a turbo, Elaine, a"
7,21,62,ELAINE,It's a tu-hur-bo.
7,21,64,WOMAN,"Excuse me, did you say turbo? Saab turbo nine-thousand? Is it..."
7,21,65,DETECTIVE,Yes ma'am.
7,21,67,KRAMER/NEWMAN,"Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine"
7,21,76,JERRY,Hello.
7,21,76,TONY,"Hey Jerry, it's Tony."
7,21,76,JERRY,"Tony, where are you?"
7,21,77,TONY,"Aw look, I just want you to know that the car is fine. I got her"
7,21,81,JERRY,"Tony, y-you better bring that car back!"
7,21,81,TONY,Nobody's giving anything back! You tried to take it from
7,21,82,JERRY,"Tony, it is my car, and I want it back!"
7,21,82,TONY,"Oh, your car. You want your car back!"
7,21,82,JERRY,Tony.
7,21,82,TONY,"Listen, that registration may have your name on it, Jerry. But"
7,21,84,JERRY,Where do I find these guys?
7,21,86,NEWMAN,How much gas we got?
7,21,86,KRAMER,Three quarters of a tank.
7,21,87,KRAMER,That's better than we estimated.
7,21,87,NEWMAN,That is seven dollars and twenty-two cents better.
7,21,88,NEWMAN,"Maybe we could uh, stop for a snack."
7,21,88,KRAMER,"Ah, no, that's not in the budget."
7,21,88,NEWMAN,"Yeah well, the budget changed, you know. I mean, it might be a"
7,21,89,KRAMER,"That's not a good investment, that's a loss."
7,21,90,KRAMER,"Hey, d'you see that car? Looks like Jerry's. I'm gonna check"
7,21,93,KRAMER,"Yeah, those are New York plates."
7,21,93,NEWMAN,Is that Jerry's number?
7,21,93,KRAMER,"I don't know, but that's New York and we're in Ohio. Those are"
7,21,95,NEWMAN,What're you doing?
7,21,95,KRAMER,I'm calling Jerry.
7,21,95,NEWMAN,On what?
7,21,95,KRAMER,Brought my phone.
7,21,97,JERRY,Y'hello.
7,21,97,KRAMER,"Yeah, hey Jerry, what's your licence plate number?"
7,21,97,JERRY,"Why, what's up?"
7,21,97,KRAMER,"Yeah, well I think I spotted your car."
7,21,97,JERRY,"Oh my god, you're kidding. Hang on a"
7,21,98,KRAMER,"Hey, that's it! That's it. Hey,"
7,21,99,JERRY,"Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, he said he brought it to the country."
7,21,99,KRAMER,Well we're in the country and we're right on his tail.
7,21,99,JERRY,"Good work Kramer, this is incredible."
7,21,99,KRAMER,"Yeah, don't worry Jerry. We're right on this guy like stink on"
7,21,102,ELAINE,Elaine Benes.
7,21,102,JERRY,"Yeah, it's me. Kramer found the car!"
7,21,102,ELAINE,"Oh my god, where is it?"
7,21,102,JERRY,"It's somewhere in the country, they're following 'em."
7,21,102,ELAINE,Are the clubs there?
7,21,102,JERRY,I don't know. They're tailing him. I'm waiting for them to call
7,21,103,ELAINE,"Alright, I'm heading over right now."
7,21,105,ELAINE,What's the status?
7,21,105,JERRY,"Last check-in, they were still on him."
7,21,105,ELAINE,"Well, have they called the police yet?"
7,21,105,JERRY,"No, they won't call the police."
7,21,105,ELAINE,What? Why not?
7,21,105,JERRY,They're afraid they'll get in trouble for misusing a mail truck.
7,21,106,ELAINE,Kramer has a record.
7,21,106,JERRY,Not a Federal record.
7,21,109,ELAINE/JERRY,Kramer?
7,21,109,JERRY,What's going on?
7,21,109,KRAMER,"Yeah, nothing. We're still following him."
7,21,111,KRAMER,"Wait a second, he's getting off. Yeah, he's gonna be going"
7,21,112,ELAINE,Keep following him.
7,21,112,KRAMER,"Alright, alright, I'll follow him."
7,21,112,NEWMAN,"Hey, we can't follow him, we're going north to Michigan."
7,21,112,KRAMER,"Yeah, hey listen, I can't. It's gonna be taking us out of our"
7,21,113,ELAINE,I need those clubs.
7,21,113,JERRY,"Kramer, I want my car."
7,21,113,KRAMER,"Well, I don't know what to do."

7,21,115,KRAMER,Alright! Alright. I'm getting off! I'm gonna go on the ramp.
7,21,118,NEWMAN,I hope you realise what you've done. You've destroyed our whole
7,21,119,KRAMER,This ramp is steep.
7,21,119,NEWMAN,"All my work, my planning, my genius. All for nought."
7,21,119,KRAMER,"Alright, look, we're pulling too much weight. He's getting away"

7,21,276,ELAINE,"Yep. Lemme get 'em for you, Mr Peterman."
7,21,276,PETERMAN,"Oh, I'll be inaugrating them this weekend, with none other than Ethel Kennedy. A woman whose triumph in the face of tragedy is exceeded only by her proclivity to procreate."
7,21,277,ELAINE,"The uh, the letter of, authenticity's in the side pocket there."
7,21,277,PETERMAN,Elaine. I never knew Kennedy had such a temper.
7,21,277,ELAINE,Oh. Oh yeah. The only thing worse was his slice.
