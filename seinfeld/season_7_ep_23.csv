7,23,0,THE INVITATIONS,Written by Larry David
7,23,1,JERRY,"I think that if the wedding invitations were left up to the men, we'd just drive around sticking flyers in windshields ...y' know... Not even typed up either, just Magic Marker, Zerox, you know...Party!!.. What's needed is a divorce announcement; Mr and Mrs Fred Johnson are requesting the honour of your presence at the ""returning"" of their daughter back to Mr,and Mrs Fred Johnson."
7,23,3,SUSAN,Hi.
7,23,3,CLERK,Hi.. May I help you?
7,23,3,SUSAN,"Yes, we'd like some wedding invitations."

7,23,6,GEORGE,What's the difference you just read it and mail it right back. These we'll do.
7,23,6,SUSAN,Why don't they make'em anymore?
7,23,6,CLERK,Well.. For one thing the glue isn't very adhesive. It takes a lot of moisture to make them stick.
7,23,6,GEORGE,So we pick up some Elmers
7,23,6,SUSAN,All right. You see what I do for you.
7,23,7,GEORGE,Hey! Kramer.

7,23,20,JERRY,"You know, I think I'm getting a little depressed about George's wedding."
7,23,20,ELAINE,Really?
7,23,20,JERRY,"Yeah. Well once he gets married that's it, she'll probably get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester."
7,23,21,ELAINE,Yeah! You're probably right.
7,23,21,JERRY,"Then it'll just be me, you and Kramer."
7,23,21,ELAINE,No! Not me pal. I can't keep this up much longer. I'm sick of being single.
7,23,22,JERRY,So it's just gonna be me and Kramer.

7,23,27,KRAMER,Huh! You make a higher roof.
7,23,27,JERRY,They're not making higher roofs.
7,23,27,KRAMER,why can't you make a higher roof.

7,23,47,ELAINE,"So I'm nothing. Jerry is best man , Kramer is an usher and I am nothing."
7,23,47,GEORGE,Well Kramer's not an usher anymore.
7,23,48,GEORGE,You've been demoted.
7,23,49,GEORGE,Because you called her by the wrong name.
7,23,49,KRAMER,But she really looks like a Lily
7,23,49,ELAINE,"Jerry Jerry, Susan says I can't be an usher at he wedding."
7,23,49,KRAMER,Yeah. me neither.

7,23,49,KRAMER,Ask her to sign a pre-nup.
7,23,49,GEORGE,What does that do?
