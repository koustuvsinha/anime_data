7,5,0,THE SOUP NAZI,Written by Spike Feresten
7,5,0,GEORGE,"All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We got 61st and 3rd or 84th and Broadway."
7,5,0,JERRY,Which one you wanna go to shmoopy?
7,5,0,SHEILA,You called me shmoppy. You're a shmoopy.
7,5,0,JERRY,You're a shmoopy!
7,5,0,SHEILA,You're a shmoopy!
7,5,0,JERRY,You're a shmoopy!
7,5,0,GEORGE,"All right, shmoopies...what's it gonna be? Pick a theater."
7,5,0,JERRY,"Uh..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place?"
7,5,0,SHEILA,No. You have a good lunch. But I'll meet you back here for the movie.
7,5,0,GEORGE,Hey.
7,5,0,ELAINE,Hey.
7,5,0,SHEILA,Hi Elaine.
7,5,0,ELAINE,Hi Sheila.
7,5,0,JERRY,"All right, then. I'll see you later."
7,5,0,SHEILA,Bye shmoopy.
7,5,0,JERRY,Bye shmoopy.
7,5,0,ELAINE,Okay. We ready to go?
7,5,0,GEORGE,"Yes. Please. Please, let's go."
7,5,0,ELAINE,"Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger."
7,5,0,JERRY,No. We gotta go to the soup place.
7,5,0,ELAINE,What soup place?
7,5,0,GEORGE,"Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there."
7,5,0,JERRY,"He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned."
7,5,0,ELAINE,Stunned by soup?
7,5,0,JERRY,"You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle."
7,5,0,ELAINE,Huh. All right. Come on.
7,5,0,JERRY,"There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi."
7,5,0,ELAINE,Why? What happens if you don't order right?
7,5,0,JERRY,He yells and you don't get your soup.
7,5,0,ELAINE,What?
7,5,0,JERRY,Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.
7,5,0,GEORGE,All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again.
7,5,0,JERRY,All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.
7,5,0,ELAINE,What?
7,5,0,JERRY,The main thing is to keep the line moving.
7,5,0,GEORGE,"All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive."
7,5,0,JERRY,Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.
7,5,0,ELAINE,"Oh, boy, I'm really scared!"
7,5,0,JERRY,Elaine.
7,5,0,ELAINE,"All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. Whoa! Wow! Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow! It's French. Armoire."
7,5,0,JERRY,Ar-moire.
7,5,0,ELAINE,How much is this?
7,5,0,FURNITURE GUY,"I was asking 250, but you got a nice face. 2 even."
7,5,0,ELAINE,"Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these things."
7,5,0,JERRY,He gave you the nice face discount.
7,5,0,ELAINE,Yeah. All right. You guys go ahead.
7,5,0,JERRY,What about the soup?
7,5,0,ELAINE,"I'm getting an armoire, Jerry."
7,5,0,JERRY,Pardon.
7,5,0,GEORGE,This line is huge.
7,5,0,JERRY,It's like this all the time.
7,5,0,GEORGE,Isn't that that Bania guy?
7,5,0,JERRY,"Oh, no. It is. Just be still."
7,5,0,GEORGE,Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent.
7,5,0,BANIA,"Hey, Jerry! I didn't know you liked soup."
7,5,0,JERRY,Hard to believe.
7,5,0,BANIA,"This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry. The best. You know what they call him? Soup Nazi."
7,5,0,JERRY,"Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line."
7,5,0,BANIA,Why not?
7,5,0,JERRY,"Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again."
7,5,0,BANIA,Okay. Okay.
7,5,0,GEORGE,Medium turkey chili.
7,5,0,JERRY,Medium crab bisque.
7,5,0,GEORGE,I didn't get any bread.
7,5,0,JERRY,Just forget it. Let it go.
7,5,0,GEORGE,"Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread."
7,5,0,SOUP NAZI,Bread -- $2 extra.
7,5,0,GEORGE,$2? But everyone in front of me got free bread.
7,5,0,SOUP NAZI,You want bread?
7,5,0,GEORGE,"Yes, please."
7,5,0,GEORGE,What?
7,5,0,SOUP NAZI,No soup for you!
7,5,1,ELAINE,What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here.
7,5,1,SUPER,"It's Sunday, Elaine. There's no moving on Sunday. That's the rule."
7,5,1,ELAINE,"But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception? Please. I've got a nice face."
7,5,1,SUPER,"Tomorrow, okay? You can move it in tommorrow. I'll even give you a hand, all right?"
7,5,1,ELAINE,"Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me."
7,5,1,FURNITURE GUY,I'm a guy on the sidewalk. I don't have layaway.
7,5,1,ELAINE,"Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away."
7,5,1,JERRY,"Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?"
7,5,1,GEORGE,"You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any?"
7,5,1,JERRY,I gave you a taste. What do you want?
7,5,1,GEORGE,Why can't we share?
7,5,1,JERRY,"I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!"
7,5,1,GEORGE,Do you hear yourself?
7,5,1,JERRY,I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.
7,5,1,GEORGE,"Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila."
7,5,1,SHEILA,Hi. Hi shmoopy.
7,5,1,JERRY,Hi shmoopy.
7,5,1,SHEILA,"No, you're a shmoopy!"
7,5,1,JERRY,You're a shmoopy!
7,5,1,GEORGE,I'm going.
7,5,1,JERRY,"Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?"
7,5,1,GEORGE,"You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so."
7,5,1,JERRY,Why?
7,5,1,GEORGE,I just don't feel like it anymore.
7,5,1,JERRY,Just like that?
7,5,1,GEORGE,Just like that.
7,5,1,SHEILA,"Boy, he's a weird guy, isn't he?"
7,5,1,KRAMER,Hey.
7,5,1,JERRY,Hey.
7,5,1,KRAMER,Yeah.
7,5,1,JERRY,Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing?
7,5,1,KRAMER,"Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street all"
7,5,2,JERRY,"Well, sit on one of your couch cushions."
7,5,2,KRAMER,"Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!"
7,5,2,ELAINE,"Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this."
7,5,2,KRAMER,"Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it."
7,5,2,ELAINE,Do you need anything?
7,5,2,KRAMER,"Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot."
7,5,2,ELAINE,Mulligatawny?
7,5,2,KRAMER,Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of
7,5,4,ELAINE,Oh! Who? The Soup Nazi?
7,5,4,KRAMER,He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most
7,5,5,ELAINE,All right. I'll be back.
7,5,5,KRAMER,Wait a second. You don't even know how to order.
7,5,5,ELAINE,"Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it."
7,5,5,KRAMER,"No. No, Elaine!"
7,5,5,ELAINE,"Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup?"
7,5,5,GEORGE,No. I didn't get it.
7,5,5,ELAINE,Why? What happened?
7,5,5,GEORGE,I made a mistake.
7,5,5,ELAINE,
7,5,5,GEORGE,"All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you."
7,5,5,ELAINE,"Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of"
7,5,6,GEORGE,"Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or do you"
7,5,7,ELAINE,"Oh, I know! It is awful!"
7,5,7,GEORGE,Why do they have to do that in front of people?
7,5,7,ELAINE,I don't know.
7,5,7,GEORGE,What is that with the shmoopy?
7,5,7,ELAINE,Ohh!
7,5,7,GEORGE,"The shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmmopy, shmoopy!"
7,5,7,ELAINE,Ohh! Stop it! I know.
7,5,7,GEORGE,I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one is
7,5,8,ELAINE,Ugh!
7,5,8,GEORGE,And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight.
7,5,8,ELAINE,"You know, we should say something."
7,5,8,GEORGE,"You know, we absolutely should."
7,5,8,ELAINE,"I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff"
7,5,9,GEORGE,I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes.
7,5,9,ELAINE,Yeah.
7,5,9,GEORGE,I still haven't figured him out.
7,5,9,ELAINE,No. Me neither.
7,5,9,GEORGE,All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode.
7,5,9,ELAINE,"Oh, God!"
7,5,9,GEORGE,Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go. Bread. Beautiful.
7,5,9,SOUP NAZI,You're pushing your luck little man.
7,5,9,GEORGE,Sorry. Thank you.
7,5,9,ELAINE,"Hi there. Um, uh -- Oh! Oh! Oh! One"
7,5,11,SOUP NAZI,Yes.
7,5,11,ELAINE,Never been a big fan. Um..you know what? Has anyone ever
7,5,13,SOUP NAZI,Very good. Very good.
7,5,13,ELAINE,"Well, I --"
7,5,13,SOUP NAZI,You know something?
7,5,13,ELAINE,Hmmm?
7,5,13,SOUP NAZI,No soup for you!
7,5,13,ELAINE,What?
7,5,13,SOUP NAZI,Come back one year! Next!
7,5,13,RAY,Look at this.
7,5,13,BOB,It's an antique.
7,5,13,RAY,It's all hand made and I love the in-lay.
7,5,13,BOB,"Yes. Yes. me, too. Ay, it's gorgeous. Completely. Pick it up. No. No."
7,5,14,KRAMER,Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing?
7,5,14,BOB,What does it look like we're doing? We're taking this.
7,5,14,KRAMER,You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine.
7,5,14,BOB,"Look, you wanna get hurt?"
7,5,14,KRAMER,Huh?
7,5,14,BOB,I don't think you wanna get hurt. Because if you wanna get hurt I can
7,5,15,RAY,Bob.
7,5,15,BOB,Just pick it up.
7,5,15,KRAMER,"What is this, huh?"
7,5,15,BOB,You have some kind of problem here? What is it you not understanding?
7,5,16,ELAINE,"I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna"
7,5,17,GEORGE,"Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste this."
7,5,17,ELAINE,"All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta sit"
7,5,18,KRAMER,"Well, b -- it was stolen."
7,5,18,ELAINE,Wha--?
7,5,18,KRAMER,"These street toughs, they robbed me."
7,5,18,ELAINE,Street toughs took my armoire?
7,5,18,KRAMER,Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You should've
7,5,19,ELAINE,I can't believe this!
7,5,19,KRAMER,"Well, where's the soup?"
7,5,19,ELAINE,Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out.
7,5,19,KRAMER,Oh...yeah!
7,5,19,JERRY,What are you gonna get?
7,5,19,SHEILA,I'll decide at the last minute.
7,5,19,JERRY,"You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!"
7,5,20,JERRY,Uh-oh.
7,5,20,SOUP NAZI,"Hey, what is this? You're kissing in my line? Nobody kisses in"
7,5,21,SHEILA,I can kiss anywhere I want to.
7,5,21,SOUP NAZI,You just cost yourself a soup!
7,5,21,SHEILA,"How dare you? Come on, Jerry, we're leaving. Jerry?"
7,5,21,JERRY,Do I know you?
7,5,21,ELAINE,"So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?"
7,5,21,JERRY,It was a bisque.
7,5,21,ELAINE,"Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become"
7,5,22,JERRY,Really?
7,5,22,ELAINE,"Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to be married."
7,5,23,JERRY,Have you tastes the soup?
7,5,23,ELAINE,Yeah. All right. You made the right decision.
7,5,23,JERRY,"See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with"
7,5,24,JERRY,Hey.
7,5,24,KRAMER,Yeah.
7,5,24,ELAINE,Hey.
7,5,24,KRAMER,Yeah.
7,5,24,JERRY,"Oh, thanks."
7,5,24,ELAINE,There he is.
7,5,24,KRAMER,"Elaine, I'm really sorry about the armoire."
7,5,24,ELAINE,"Yeah. I know. Me, too."
7,5,24,JERRY,"So, did these thieves want any money?"
7,5,24,KRAMER,No.
7,5,24,JERRY,They just wanted the armoire?
7,5,24,KRAMER,Yeah. They were..quite taken with it.
7,5,25,JERRY,Yeah?
7,5,25,GEORGE,Hup! Hup!
7,5,25,JERRY,"Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?"
7,5,25,ELAINE,No. In what way?
7,5,25,JERRY,"I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or"
7,5,26,ELAINE,I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.
7,5,26,GEORGE,Hello.
7,5,26,JERRY,Hello.
7,5,26,KRAMER,Hey.
7,5,26,GEORGE,Hello.
7,5,26,ELAINE,Hello.
7,5,26,GEORGE,Were you just talking about me? What's going on?
7,5,26,JERRY,Absolutely not.
7,5,26,GEORGE,Something's going on here.
7,5,26,KRAMER,"All right, I'm gonna go get some soup."
7,5,26,ELAINE,One of these days that guy is gonna get his.
7,5,26,GEORGE,"So, how was the movie?"
7,5,26,JERRY,"Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs."
7,5,26,GEORGE,"Oh, yeah?"
7,5,26,JERRY,"Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?"
7,5,26,GEORGE,Happy? Why should I be happy?
7,5,26,JERRY,"I don't know, but you look like you're happy."
7,5,26,GEORGE,Why should I care?
7,5,26,JERRY,"You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know when"
7,5,27,GEORGE,"All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because the two of"
7,5,29,JERRY,Is that so?
7,5,29,GEORGE,"Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy,"
7,5,30,JERRY,Disgusting?
7,5,30,GEORGE,People who do that should be arrested.
7,5,30,JERRY,"Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her."
7,5,30,GEORGE,"Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know."
7,5,30,JERRY,What?
7,5,30,GEORGE,You shook my hand in that coffee shop.
7,5,30,JERRY,You're still with the pact?
7,5,30,GEORGE,Mmm-hmm. You reneged.
7,5,30,JERRY,All I did was shake your hand.
7,5,30,GEORGE,Ah-ha!
7,5,30,KRAMER,"And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that."
7,5,30,SOUP NAZI,Ohh! This city.
7,5,30,NEWMAN,"One large jambalaya, please."
7,5,30,SOUP NAZI,"So, continue."
7,5,30,KRAMER,"Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, she's very"
7,5,31,NEWMAN,Thank you. Jambalaya!
7,5,31,SOUP NAZI,"All right, now listen to me. You have been a good friend. I have"
7,5,33,KRAMER,How can I possibly thank you?
7,5,33,SOUP NAZI,You are the only one who understands me.
7,5,33,KRAMER,You suffer for your soup.
7,5,33,SOUP NAZI,Yes. That is right.
7,5,33,KRAMER,"You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup."
7,5,33,SOUP NAZI,How can I tolerate any less from my customer?
7,5,33,CUSTOMER,"Uh, gazpacho, por favor."
7,5,33,SOUP NAZI,Por favor?
7,5,33,CUSTOMER,"Um, I'm part Spanish."
7,5,33,SOUP NAZI,Adios muchacho!
7,5,33,KRAMER,Git.
7,5,33,JERRY,It was stupid of me.
7,5,33,SHEILA,"Well, it was very insulting."
7,5,33,JERRY,No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.
7,5,33,SHEILA,"Well, behind every joke there's some truth."
7,5,33,JERRY,What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth
7,5,37,SHEILA,"Well, I guess you're right."
7,5,37,JERRY,"So, am I forgiven, shmoopy?"
7,5,37,SHEILA,"Yes, shmoopy."
7,5,37,JERRY,Aw!
7,5,37,SUSAN,"Hey, Jerry!"
7,5,37,JERRY,"Oh, hi Susan, George. You remember Sheila."
7,5,37,GEORGE,"Oh, yes. Hello."
7,5,37,SHEILA,Hello. Won't you join us?
7,5,37,GEORGE,"No, thanks."
7,5,37,SUSAN,Of course.
7,5,37,GEORGE,"Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh?"
7,5,37,JERRY,Yeah. That's right. You got a problem?
7,5,37,GEORGE,
7,5,38,JERRY,"Well, we're changing the rules."
7,5,38,GEORGE,Ahh. Good for you.
7,5,38,SUSAN,"Aw, what are you getting George?"
7,5,38,GEORGE,"I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? I"
7,5,40,SUSAN,"Oh, George, you're so sweet."
7,5,40,GEORGE,"Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie."
7,5,40,SUSAN,Aww!

7,5,43,ELAINE,The K Man did it!
7,5,43,KRAMER,Yeah!
7,5,43,ELAINE,How much did you pay for this thing?
7,5,43,KRAMER,How 'bout zero?
7,5,43,ELAINE,What?
7,5,43,KRAMER,Yeah.
7,5,43,ELAINE,What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?
7,5,43,KRAMER,I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously
7,5,44,ELAINE,Get out!
7,5,46,ELAINE,The Soup Nazi gave it to you?
7,5,46,KRAMER,Yeah.
7,5,46,ELAINE,Why?
7,5,46,KRAMER,"Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha --"
7,5,47,ELAINE,
7,5,47,KRAMER,"Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh...."
7,5,47,ELAINE,"Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I"
7,5,48,KRAMER,"Yeah. Well, he's a dear."
7,5,48,GEORGE,How much tip do you leave on $8.15?
7,5,48,SUSAN,"You know sweetie, I just want you to know that I was so proud of you"
7,5,51,GEORGE,Huh?
7,5,51,SUSAN,Because you love your little kiki don't you?
7,5,51,CUSTOMER,How is he today?
7,5,51,BANIA,I think he's in a good mood.
7,5,51,ELAINE,"Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful."
7,5,52,SOUP NAZI,"You? If I knew it was for you, I never would have given it to"
7,5,54,JERRY,I'm heading over to Elaine's.
7,5,54,KRAMER,"Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire."
7,5,54,JERRY,Those two?
7,5,54,KRAMER,Yeah.
7,5,54,JERRY,Are you sure?
7,5,54,KRAMER,Yeah. That's them.
7,5,54,JERRY,"Well, let's confront 'em."
7,5,54,KRAMER,No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop.
7,5,54,JERRY,There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.
7,5,54,KRAMER,No!
7,5,54,JERRY,Let's go.
7,5,54,BOB,"Oh, wow look, that one is gorgeous. I would just kill for that one."
7,5,54,RAY,"Oh, not in blue. Blue does not go with all."
7,5,54,BOB,"Oh, please. Do you know what you're talking about? Because I don't"
7,5,55,KRAMER,Excuse me.
7,5,55,RAY,Are you talking to me?
7,5,55,KRAMER,"Uh, well, uh, we --"
7,5,55,RAY,"I said, are you talking to me?"
7,5,55,BOB,"Well, maybe, he was talking to me. Was you talking to him? Because you"
7,5,57,KRAMER,"Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each"
7,5,59,ELAINE,"I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life."
7,5,61,JERRY,"I don't know. "" 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of"
7,5,62,ELAINE,Let me see this. You know what this is? This is a recipe
7,5,64,JERY,So?
7,5,64,ELAINE,"So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to"
7,5,66,JERRY,"Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?"
7,5,66,ELAINE,What do you care?
7,5,66,JERRY,"Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup"
7,5,67,ELAINE,"Get out of my way, Jerry."
7,5,67,JERRY,"Elaine, let the man make his soup!"
7,5,67,ELAINE,"Don't make me hurt you, Jerry."

7,5,68,GEORGE,"Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey."
7,5,68,JERRY,Well. Well.
7,5,68,SUSAN,"Hi, Jerry."
7,5,68,JERRY,"Hey, Susan, George."
7,5,68,SUSAN,"You know, I really like Sheila a lot."
7,5,68,JERRY,"Oh, really?"
7,5,68,SUSAN,Mmm-hmm.
7,5,68,JERRY,Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.
7,5,68,SUSAN,"Oh, no! That's too bad."
7,5,68,JERRY,"Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection."
7,5,68,GEORGE,Really?
7,5,68,JERRY,"Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that."
7,5,68,SUSAN,Mmm-hmm.
7,5,68,GEORGE,You did?
7,5,68,JERRY,"Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya."
