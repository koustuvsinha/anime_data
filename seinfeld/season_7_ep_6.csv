7,6,0,THE SECRET CODE,Written by Alec Berg & Jeff Schaffer
7,6,1,JERRY,"They really got us trained to use that cash machine now, don't they? We're just like chickens in an experiment waiting for that pellet to come down the chute. You see people at the cash machine; they're just there. Just, dit dit dit dit dit dit dit, they're waiting for the sound, you know the sound, you're waiting for the sound. That's what we're trained to hear, the 'here comes the money' sound, ya know? Flip flip flip flip flip flip flip. It's exciting, don't you get excited? It's coming! It's coming! They're giving me money!"
7,6,2,SUSAN,"Hey, I gotta get some cash, I'm gonna run down to the ATM."
7,6,2,GEORGE,"Yeah, I better grab some too."
7,6,2,SUSAN,I'll get it for you; just give me your card.
7,6,2,GEORGE,You sure?
7,6,2,SUSAN,"Yeah, just tell me your code."
7,6,2,GEORGE,My code?
7,6,3,JERRY,So why didn't you tell her the code?
7,6,3,GEORGE,No. No way.
7,6,3,JERRY,"George, you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely."
7,6,3,GEORGE,"It says very clearly, 'for your protection, do not give your secret code to anyone.'"
7,6,3,JERRY,So you're taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now?
7,6,3,GEORGE,Why does everything have to be 'us'? Is there no 'me' left? Why can't there be some things just for me? Is that so selfish?
7,6,3,JERRY,"Actually, that's the definition of selfish."
7,6,3,GEORGE,Have you ever given your code to anyone?
7,6,3,JERRY,No one's ever asked. You want it? It's 'Jor-El.'
7,6,3,GEORGE,Superman's father on Krypton.
7,6,3,JERRY,"Of course. C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up inside. Sing it, sister."
7,6,3,GEORGE,No. I am not giving my code to anyone for any reason.
7,6,3,JERRY,What if my life depended on it?
7,6,3,GEORGE,"If you're in some situation where some fast cash will save your life, I'll give you the code."
7,6,4,GEORGE,What's the matter with your leg?
7,6,4,JERRY,My foot fell asleep.
7,6,4,GEORGE,How'd your foot fall asleep?
7,6,4,JERRY,"I crossed my legs, I forgot to alternate."
7,6,5,FRED,Hey Jerry.
7,6,5,JERRY,Hey Fred.
7,6,5,GEORGE,Hey Fred.
7,6,5,JERRY,My foot fell asleep.
7,6,5,FRED,"You're lucky, at least you got something to do."
7,6,6,JERRY,"Fred, do you know Elaine?"
7,6,6,FRED,"No, it's nice to meet you. Well, I'm outta here, see you guys."
7,6,6,GEORGE,"Alright, bye."
7,6,6,JERRY,Seeya.
7,6,6,ELAINE,"Did you hear that? He said, 'nice to meet you.'"
7,6,6,JERRY,So?
7,6,6,ELAINE,"So? We've met before. At Katie Ash's party, we talked for like ten"
7,6,7,JERRY,And he didn't remember you?
7,6,8,JERRY,"Where are you going, you just got here?"
7,6,8,ELAINE,I gotta go talk to him.
7,6,9,ELAINE,"Excuse me, excuse me, Fred?"
7,6,9,FRED,Yeah?
7,6,9,ELAINE,"You just said, 'nice to meet you', but actually we've met before."
7,6,9,FRED,We have?
7,6,9,ELAINE,"Yeah, at Katie Ash's party?"
7,6,9,FRED,What was your name again?
7,6,9,ELAINE,Elaine. You don't remember our conversation? I talked about how my
7,6,10,FRED,Not ringing a bell.
7,6,10,ELAINE,"When my uncle said to him, 'the president's been shot' Oswald winked at"
7,6,11,FRED,"Mmm, no."
7,6,11,ELAINE,That was right when we were in front of the bathroom door.
7,6,11,FRED,"The bathroom door. I remember someone had played tic-tac-toe on it, and"
7,6,13,JERRY,"Hey that sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should"
7,6,15,JERRY,"Uh huh, okay, alright, bye. Huh, how do you like that? I'm gonna do"
7,6,17,KRAMER,"Leapin' Larry! Yeah, that's where I bought this."
7,6,17,JERRY,What is that?
7,6,17,KRAMER,"Well, it's an emergency band scanner, it picks up everything: Fires,"
7,6,20,JERRY,"Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made."
7,6,20,KRAMER,"When I was a kid, all I ever dreamed of was steering the back of that"
7,6,21,JERRY,You're lucky they let you drive a car.
7,6,21,KRAMER,"No no no, they're talking the West Side Highway, at this time of day"
7,6,23,ELAINE,What was that?
7,6,23,JERRY,Eh.
7,6,23,ELAINE,"Alright. So, get a load of this. This guy, Fred Yerkes, remembers"
7,6,24,JERRY,"Really? I'm surprised, he doesn't meet that many women."
7,6,24,ELAINE,What are you saying?
7,6,24,JERRY,"Well, what's to be said? He didn't remember you."
7,6,24,ELAINE,"Yeah, but why? I mean, ya know."
7,6,24,JERRY,I know.
7,6,24,ELAINE,Ya know?
7,6,24,JERRY,"Yeah, I know."
7,6,24,ELAINE,"Huh, lookit, you got the new catalog."
7,6,24,JERRY,"Yeah, you wrote a good piece on the Himalayan Walking Shoe."
7,6,24,ELAINE,"Too good. Peterman was so pleased, now he wants to take me out to"
7,6,25,JERRY,Why would I wanna do that?
7,6,25,ELAINE,"Oh please, Jerry, please please please, I can't sit with him, he tells"
7,6,26,JERRY,"Yeah, sounds like fun."
7,6,27,SUSAN,"I want you to tell me, George."
7,6,27,GEORGE,Why? Why is my code so important?
7,6,27,SUSAN,"Because, it's part of our relationship, it's an indication of trust."
7,6,28,GEORGE,Well I'm sure you have secrets from me. I don't know anything about
7,6,29,SUSAN,My cycles?
7,6,29,GEORGE,"Yeah, I never know what's going on there."
7,6,29,SUSAN,Well from now on I'll keep you apprised of my cycles.
7,6,29,GEORGE,Please.
7,6,29,SUSAN,Anything else?
7,6,29,GEORGE,We're out of Bosco!
7,6,30,JERRY,"Howbout this, come one down to Leapin' Parry's if you can beat our"
7,6,31,LEAPIN' LARRY,"Ya know I've always liked your comedy, you don't take cheap"
7,6,32,JERRY,No I don't.
7,6,32,LEAPIN' LARRY,"Sorry for keeping you here so long. Again, I apologize for the"
7,6,33,JERRY,My foot's asleep again!
7,6,34,LEAPIN' LARRY,"When I lost my leg in the boating accident, I got so depressed"
7,6,36,JERRY,You know what? I'll be with you in a minute.
7,6,38,EMPLOYEE,That is a great impression!
7,6,40,JERRY,"Larry, wait, you don't understand!"
7,6,41,KRAMER,"I just came from Leapin' Larry's. Making fun of crippled people, is"
7,6,42,JERRY,"I didn't do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep."
7,6,42,KRAMER,"Oh, oh your foot fell asleep."
7,6,42,JERRY,"Ya know, the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry,"
7,6,43,KRAMER,"Well, you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you,"
7,6,45,JERRY,Yup.
7,6,45,VOICE,Hup.
7,6,46,KRAMER,"Boy, look at that. Se that's that fire I was listening to yesterday."
7,6,46,JERRY,"Wow, the whole building burned down."
7,6,46,KRAMER,They just don't know what street to take. You remember that time I got
7,6,47,JERRY,Of course.
7,6,47,KRAMER,"It's all up here, Jerry. All up here. It's innate."
7,6,47,JERRY,The amazing thing is you never have any place to go.
7,6,48,GEORGE,Where we gonna eat?
7,6,48,JERRY,We're gonna meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place.
7,6,48,GEORGE,Peterman? Nobody mentioned anything about Peterman.
7,6,48,JERRY,"Of course not, if I did would you have gone?"
7,6,48,GEORGE,No way.
7,6,48,JERRY,There you go.
7,6,48,GEORGE,I don't even know Peterman. How the hell am I gonna relax? I'm gonna
7,6,50,JERRY,"Trust me, you're off."
7,6,51,ELAINE,"Oh, hi Fred."
7,6,51,FRED,"Um, hello?"
7,6,51,ELAINE,It's Elaine.
7,6,51,FRED,"Oh yeah, yeah, right."
7,6,51,ELAINE,How ya doin'?
7,6,51,FRED,"I'm depressed. I got this new shirt, the button fell off. Once the"
7,6,52,ELAINE,"Yeah, that's too bad."
7,6,52,FRED,"Yeah, I'm gonna get some vitamins, I feel depleted."
7,6,52,ELAINE,Hmm. I never take them.
7,6,52,FRED,"Cause they make you nauseous, right?"
7,6,52,ELAINE,"Yeah! Yeah, that's right, you remembered!"
7,6,52,FRED,Do you wanna have dinner tonight?
7,6,52,ELAINE,Hmm. Tonight.
7,6,52,FRED,"What, you have other plans?"
7,6,52,ELAINE,"No, no no no, none that I can, um, remember."
7,6,54,JERRY,"...Alright, you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet."
7,6,56,GEORGE,Call the Embassy.
7,6,56,JERRY,They're closed.
7,6,56,GEORGE,Why?
7,6,56,JERRY,Bomb threat.
7,6,56,GEORGE,We're in Turkey?
7,6,56,JERRY,"Midnight Express, my friend."
7,6,56,GEORGE,My card won't work there; they're not on the Plus system.
7,6,57,PETERMAN,You must be Jerry Seinfeld.
7,6,57,JERRY,"Yes, hi, Mr. Peterman. This is, uh, George Costanza."
7,6,57,PETERMAN,
7,6,57,GEORGE,
7,6,57,JERRY,"Well, is Elaine here?"
7,6,57,PETERMAN,"Oh, Elaine just called, she won't be joining us. Not to worry, I'll"
7,6,58,GEORGE,What's going on? He still wants to have dinner with us?
7,6,58,JERRY,Without Elaine? What for?
7,6,58,GEORGE,"What, is he crazy?"
7,6,58,JERRY,"We gotta get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man."
7,6,58,GEORGE,"I've got nothing, I-I-I-I'm blank."
7,6,58,JERRY,"George, what's the matter with you?"
7,6,58,GEORGE,I'm choking!
7,6,58,PETERMAN,"Ah, Fong has been most accommodating. Shall we?"
7,6,58,JERRY,"Actually, you know I just remembered I promised this comedy club that"
7,6,59,PETERMAN,"I understand, no hard feelings. George and I will miss your company."
7,6,61,ELAINE,"I can't believe this, is this guy standing me up?"
7,6,63,PETERMAN,"...And there, tucked into the river's bend was the object of my"
7,6,66,GEORGE,Howbout sports? Do you follow sports?
7,6,68,TV ANNOUNCER,It's fourth and inches and the Giants are going for it! You
7,6,70,GEORGE,"You know, this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really."
7,6,70,PETERMAN,"Ha ha, nonsense, George. Besides it gives me a chance to tell you"
7,6,72,PETERMAN,"Peterman here. What? Oh no. Alright, I'll be right there. (To"
7,6,77,JERRY,I can't believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor.
7,6,77,ELAINE,"Well, Fred asked me out."
7,6,77,JERRY,Fred?
7,6,77,ELAINE,"Yeah, and then he stood me up. I don't get this guy."
7,6,77,JERRY,You see what's going on here? You're attracted to him because he can't
7,6,78,ELAINE,I am? But that's so sick.
7,6,78,JERRY,That's God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together.
7,6,78,ELAINE,"Anyway, so how was the dinner?"
7,6,78,JERRY,"Well, when I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the"
7,6,79,ELAINE,What about Georgie?
7,6,79,JERRY,"Nah, he didn't make it."
7,6,81,PETERMAN,"Doctor, how is she?"
7,6,81,DOCTOR,She's too weak to talk but she'll be happy to hear your voice.
7,6,81,PETERMAN,"Mama, it's me. Jacopo. I'm here for you, mama."
7,6,82,GEORGE,"I'm, uh, George Costanza. I was having dinner with your son."
7,6,84,PETERMAN,"Shake off the dew, my friend."
7,6,84,GEORGE,Yeah. What time is it?
7,6,84,PETERMAN,It's morning. Thanks for seeing me through the night. I'll make us
7,6,85,GEORGE,Who?
7,6,85,PETERMAN,"Momma. Just talk to her, George. The doctor seems to think it"
7,6,87,GEORGE,"Hi. I-I really should be getting back to my fiancé, you know, we, uh,"
7,6,93,MRS. PETERMAN,Bosco. Bosco.
7,6,93,GEORGE,"Oh, shhh."
7,6,93,MRS. PETERMAN,Bosco!

7,6,94,MRS. PETERMAN,Bosco! Bosco! Bosco!
7,6,94,GEORGE,Shut up! Shut up!
7,6,95,PETERMAN,Momma! What are you trying to say?
7,6,95,MRS. PETERMAN,Bosco.
7,6,96,PETERMAN,She's gone. Bosco?
7,6,98,GEORGE,You know this whole thing never would have happened if you hadn't
7,6,99,JERRY,I did not bail out on you.
7,6,99,GEORGE,Well why couldn't you include me in your excuse?
7,6,99,JERRY,Why didn't you come up with your own?
7,6,99,GEORGE,I froze. I think I'm losing it.
7,6,99,JERRY,"Ah, c'mon. Maybe you're just in a slump?"
7,6,99,GEORGE,"No, no. I reached down and there was *nothing* there."
7,6,100,GEORGE,Now Peterman wants me to go to the funeral.
7,6,100,JERRY,"Oh, come on, just tell me your code already. What is it?"
7,6,100,GEORGE,I am not giving you my code.
7,6,100,KRAMER,I'll bet I can guess it.
7,6,100,GEORGE,Pssh. Yeah. Right.
7,6,100,KRAMER,"Oh, alright. Yeah. Uh, let's see. Um, well, we can throw out"
7,6,103,GEORGE,Huh?
7,6,103,KRAMER,"You're a portly fellow, a bit long in the waistband. So what's your"
7,6,105,GEORGE,Get out of here.
7,6,105,KRAMER,"Oh you may stray, but you'll always return to your dark master, the"
7,6,106,GEORGE,I'm leaving.
7,6,106,KRAMER,"No, and only the"
7,6,107,GEORGE,I gotta go.
7,6,107,KRAMER,If you could you'd guzzle it by the gallon! Ovaltine! Hershey's!
7,6,107,GEORGE,Shut up!
7,6,107,KRAMER,Nestlé's Quik!
7,6,107,GEORGE,Shut up!
7,6,108,GEORGE,What was that?
7,6,108,ELAINE,What?
7,6,108,GEORGE,You just checked your watch. Are you thinking of bailing on him?
7,6,108,ELAINE,I got a date.
7,6,109,ELAINE,"Oh, Mr. Peterman."
7,6,109,PETERMAN,"Oh, Elaine. George, when momma said 'Bosco' she must have been"
7,6,110,GEORGE,Mothers say things. My mother goes babbling on and on like a crazy
7,6,111,ELAINE,"Mr. Peterman, you have my deepest sympathies. Unfortunately, I've"
7,6,112,PETERMAN,You do?
7,6,112,GEORGE,"Uh, yes, actually we-we both do."
7,6,112,ELAINE,I have a personal commitment.
7,6,112,GEORGE,"Well, personal, I mean, we both uh..."
7,6,112,PETERMAN,What is it?
7,6,112,ELAINE,I'm speaking at a women's' rights conference.
7,6,112,GEORGE,"Yes, and I'm speaking at a men's' conference."
7,6,112,PETERMAN,"I don't believe that for a minute. Well, Elaine, it was good of you"
7,6,113,ELAINE,My pleasure.
7,6,113,PETERMAN,"Fortunately, I still have George here to help me through this."
7,6,114,PETERMAN,"You know George, growing up as a boy in Costa Rica, I heard a rumor"
7,6,116,KRAMER,"Hey, you wanna come down the fire station with me?"
7,6,116,JERRY,Fire station?
7,6,116,KRAMER,"Yeah, I made a map of my shortcuts. I'm gonna rock their world!"
7,6,116,JERRY,"Nah, I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's."
7,6,116,KRAMER,"Oh, so he took you back."
7,6,116,JERRY,"Yeah, we straightened it out, all is forgiven."
7,6,116,KRAMER,"Well, you know the important thing is that you learned something."
7,6,116,JERRY,No I didn't.
7,6,117,CAPTAIN,"Well, Mr. Kramer, your list of short cuts is most impressive."
7,6,117,KRAMER,"Yeah, and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the"
7,6,118,CAPTAIN,"Mr. Kramer, just about every week some brash young hothead like"
7,6,121,JERRY,"Anyway, thanks for having me back, and sorry about the misunderstanding."
7,6,121,LEAPIN' LARRY,"Water under the bridge. Come on, I never did get a chance to"
7,6,122,JERRY,Oh sure.
7,6,123,JERRY,"Uh, again? I'll be right there."
7,6,127,DISPATCHER,"Attention Company 390, structure fire at Leapin' Larry's Appliance"
7,6,128,KRAMER,"Leapin' Larry's? Hey, that's uptown. You gotta take Amsterdam."
7,6,128,CAPTAIN,"Stay out of this, Kramer."
7,6,130,KRAMER,"Are you ok, cowboy? Where do you need to go?"
7,6,130,FIREMAN,I drive the back of the truck.
7,6,131,KRAMER,"Well, you'd better take it easy."
7,6,133,FRED,"Sorry about the other night but my mother called, she couldn't find her"
7,6,135,ELAINE,Huh.
7,6,135,FRED,The worst part is getting from the subway station to the house. There's
7,6,136,ELAINE,What am I doing? I'm on a date with this guy because he
7,6,137,FRED,
7,6,140,PETERMAN,Bosco. Bosco. Bosco.
7,6,143,PETERMAN,George!
7,6,144,CAPTAIN,Gonna make a left onto Broadway.
7,6,144,KRAMER,"No, I would advise against that."
7,6,144,CAPTAIN,Who is this?
7,6,145,KRAMER,It's Kramer!
7,6,145,CAPTAIN,Kramer?! What the hell are you doing back there?
7,6,145,KRAMER,"DeSoto's down, but Cosmo's got the caboose."
7,6,147,WOMAN,How did this start?
7,6,147,JERRY,Beats me.
7,6,147,LEAPIN' LARRY,Where the hell's the fire department? I'm gonna lose the whole
7,6,149,CAPTAIN,"Kramer, get the hell off of there. You're not trained to operate this"
7,6,150,MAN ON THE STREET,"Hey, Kramer!"
7,6,150,KRAMER,Hey!
7,6,151,LEAPIN' LARRY,"Try the scanner, see if you can pick up anything."
7,6,152,CAPTAIN,"What are you doing, Kramer?! You're all over the road!"
7,6,152,KRAMER,"Don't worry, Cap, I can handle it!"
7,6,152,JERRY,Kramer?
7,6,153,CAPTAIN,You're losing control! Hard right! Hard right!
7,6,155,JERRY,"Ah, that's a shame."
7,6,156,PETERMAN,The fire will eat up this entire block!
7,6,157,PETERMAN,"Look, there's a man in there. Get out of there, you're in danger!"
7,6,157,MAN,"But my sleeve, it's stuck in the machine, it ate my card!"
7,6,157,PETERMAN,"George, give me your ATM card!"
7,6,157,GEORGE,I don't have my ATM card.
7,6,157,PETERMAN,"George, you're obviously lying, anyone can see that!"
7,6,159,PETERMAN,"It's jammed! I'll slide it under the door,"
7,6,160,MAN,Now give me your code!
7,6,160,GEORGE,What?! Why?
7,6,160,MAN,The machine won't open without the code!
7,6,160,PETERMAN,"George, give him your code!"
7,6,160,GEORGE,But I-I-I-
7,6,160,PETERMAN,"George, there's no time! Tell him your code! Shout out your code,"
7,6,161,MAN,The code!! The code!!
7,6,163,SUSAN,"Hi. Here's your cash, George."
7,6,163,GEORGE,Hm. Thanks.
7,6,163,SUSAN,And here's your card back. Anyone for Bosco?
7,6,163,JERRY,Oh my god. Look at this.
7,6,163,GEORGE,Hm?
7,6,163,PERRY,It's the new J. Peterman catalog. Look.
7,6,164,GEORGE,"The Rogue's Wallet. That's where he kept his card, his dirty little secret. Short, devious, balding. his name was Costanza. He killed my mother."
