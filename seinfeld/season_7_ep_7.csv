7,7,2,ELAINE,There's nobody I can go with.
7,7,3,ELAINE,You know what. I don't have one female friend left.
7,7,3,KRAMER,"Oh, no, of course you don't. You're a Man's Woman. You hate other women, and they hate you."

7,7,3,KRAMER,That's gunna be trouble.
7,7,3,JERRY,Why?
7,7,3,KRAMER,"Jerry, don't you see? This world here, this is George's sanctuary. If Susan comes into contact with this world, his world's collide. You know what happens then?"

7,7,9,GEORGE,"Oh, I don't think you want to do that."
7,7,9,ELAINE,Why not?
7,7,9,GEORGE,Well what would be the point of that?
7,7,10,ELAINE,"George, are you going to put her on the phone?"
7,7,10,GEORGE,Where did this come from all of a sudden?
7,7,10,ELAINE,"George, are you going to let me talk to Susan, or Not?"
7,7,10,GEORGE,I really think I should have been consulted about this.
