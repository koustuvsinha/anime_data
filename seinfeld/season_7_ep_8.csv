7,8,0,THE SPONGE,Written by Peter Mehlman
7,8,1,JERRY,"I have a friend, wears eyeglasses, no prescription in the glasses because he thinks it makes him look more intelligent, now why? Why do we think that glasses makes us look more intelligent? Is it from the endless hours of reading and studying and researching that this person supposedly blew out their eyeballs, and that's why they need the glasses? It's just a corrective device. If you see someone with a hearing aid, you don't think, 'Oh, they must have been listening real good...yeah, to a lot of important stuff...' No, they are deaf. They can't hear."
7,8,2,KRAMER,"Hey, boys and girls. I need you both to sponsor me in the AIDS walk."
7,8,2,ELAINE,Is that tomorrow?
7,8,2,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, so...git-git..."
7,8,2,ELAINE,"Well, I admire you for joining the fight against AIDS."
7,8,2,KRAMER,"Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with myself."
7,8,2,JERRY,It's hard enough living next door.
7,8,2,KRAMER,"I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the walk, baby. I'll be right back."
7,8,3,ELAINE,New jeans?
7,8,3,JERRY,Yeah.
7,8,3,ELAINE,Still a 31 waist?
7,8,3,JERRY,"Yep. Since college. Hey, Lena Small's on this list."
7,8,3,ELAINE,Lena Small?
7,8,3,JERRY,"Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and now here's her number."
7,8,3,ELAINE,"Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity list!"
7,8,3,JERRY,"Elaine, you should admire me...I'm aspiring to date a giving person."
7,8,3,ELAINE,You're a taking person.
7,8,3,JERRY,"That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam."
7,8,3,ELAINE,She's gonna ask how you got her number.
7,8,3,JERRY,"Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to me."
7,8,3,ELAINE,What's he look like?
7,8,3,JERRY,"I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying a speedboat."
7,8,3,ELAINE,You're buying a speedboat?
7,8,3,JERRY,"See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number. All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home free."
7,8,3,ELAINE,I don't know about that.
7,8,3,JERRY,"So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have gone out with him?"
7,8,3,ELAINE,Well...
7,8,3,JERRY,Yeah. So you really like this guy.
7,8,3,ELAINE,Very much.
7,8,3,JERRY,How's the...sexual chemistry?
7,8,3,ELAINE,Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping today.
7,8,3,KRAMER,Are you still on the pill?
7,8,3,ELAINE,"Uh, Kramer..."
7,8,3,KRAMER,"I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an open forum."
7,8,3,ELAINE,"The sponge, o.k.? The Today sponge."
7,8,3,KRAMER,But wasn't that taken off the market?
7,8,3,ELAINE,"Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves the sponge."
7,8,3,KRAMER,"I read it in Wall Street Week...Louis, uh, Rukeyser."
7,8,5,JERRY,"Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. How did I get your number? I met a guy that knows you, he gave it to me...I don't remember his name. Think it began with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying that much attention, I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat..."
7,8,6,SUSAN,"You know, I really like those new jeans Jerry was wearing. He's really thin."
7,8,6,GEORGE,Not as thin as you think.
7,8,6,SUSAN,Why? He's a 31. I saw the tag on the back.
7,8,6,GEORGE,"The tag, huh?"
7,8,6,SUSAN,Mmm-hmm.
7,8,6,GEORGE,"Let me tell you something about that tag. It's no 31, and uh...let's just leave it at that."
7,8,6,SUSAN,What are you talking about?
7,8,6,GEORGE,He scratches off a 32 and he puts in
7,8,6,SUSAN,"Oh, how could he be so vain?"
7,8,6,GEORGE,"Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe I just told you that."
7,8,6,SUSAN,Why not?
7,8,6,GEORGE,"Well, Jerry doesn't want anyone to know."
7,8,6,SUSAN,"Well, it's alright, I'm your fiance. Everyone assumes you'll tell me everything."
7,8,6,GEORGE,Where did you get that from?
7,8,6,SUSAN,"Well, we're a couple. It's understood."
7,8,6,GEORGE,I never heard of that.
7,8,6,SUSAN,"Well, you've never been a couple."
7,8,6,GEORGE,I've coupled! I've coupled!
7,8,6,SUSAN,Keeping secrets! This is just like your secret bank code.
7,8,6,GEORGE,"This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the loop!"
7,8,7,GEORGE,Hey.
7,8,7,JERRY,Hey. What's the matter?
7,8,7,GEORGE,I had a fight with Susan.
7,8,7,JERRY,What about?
7,8,7,GEORGE,"Oh... ...clothing, something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today?"
7,8,7,JERRY,"I got a date with that girl, Lena."
7,8,7,GEORGE,"Lena, how'd you meet her?"
7,8,7,JERRY,"I actually met her a few weeks ago, but..."
7,8,7,GEORGE,"You met her a few weeks ago, but...?"
7,8,7,JERRY,I didn't call her till today.
7,8,7,GEORGE,"So, uh...wanna double?"
7,8,7,JERRY,What?
7,8,7,GEORGE,"Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic."
7,8,7,JERRY,I dunno. Hey.
7,8,7,ELAINE,"Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off the market."
7,8,7,JERRY,So what are you gonna do?
7,8,7,ELAINE,"I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store in a 25-block radius."
7,8,7,GEORGE,Just for these sponges?
7,8,7,ELAINE,"Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods. What does Susan use?"
7,8,7,GEORGE,I dunno.
7,8,7,ELAINE,You don't know?
7,8,7,GEORGE,
7,8,7,JERRY,What are you all out of breath from?
7,8,7,KRAMER,The elevator just broke. I had to walk up five flights.
7,8,7,JERRY,"And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, you're in horrible shape."
7,8,7,KRAMER,"Hey, I'm in tip-top shape. Better than you!"
7,8,7,JERRY,"I got a 31 waist, mister!"
7,8,7,KRAMER,"Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?"
7,8,7,JERRY,What am I doing? I'm...dating a woman who happens to be sponsoring one of these walkers.
7,8,8,PHARMACIST,Can I help you?
7,8,8,ELAINE,"Yeah, do you have any Today sponges? I know they're off the market, but..."
7,8,8,PHARMACIST,"Actually, we have a case left."
7,8,8,ELAINE,"A case! A case of sponges? I mean, uh...a case. Huh. Uh...how many come in a case?"
7,8,8,PHARMACIST,Sixty.
7,8,8,ELAINE,"Sixty?! Uh...well, I'll take three."
7,8,8,PHARMACIST,Three.
7,8,8,ELAINE,Make it ten.
7,8,8,PHARMACIST,Ten?
7,8,8,ELAINE,Twenty sponges should be plenty.
7,8,8,PHARMACIST,Did you say twenty?
7,8,8,ELAINE,"Yeah, twenty-five sponges is just fine."
7,8,8,PHARMACIST,"Right. So, you're set with twenty-five."
7,8,8,ELAINE,Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way.
7,8,9,JERRY,"Hey, I have found the best-smelling detergent. Lena, smell my shirt."
7,8,9,LENA,Mmm! Very nice.
7,8,9,JERRY,It's All-Tempa-Cheer.
7,8,9,LENA,I use Planet. It's bio-degradable and doesn't pollute the oceans.
7,8,9,GEORGE,"Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy."
7,8,9,LENA,"Can you wrap up all the left-overs on the table, please? I always take the left-overs. I work in a soup kitchen every morning at 6 a.m."
7,8,9,JERRY,They serve soup at 6 a.m.?
7,8,9,LENA,Yeah. That's all they have.
7,8,9,JERRY,"Do the bums ever complain? ""Soup again?"""
7,8,9,GEORGE,I'd get tired of it.
7,8,9,JERRY,How could you not?
7,8,9,LENA,Guess who volunteered last week?
7,8,9,GEORGE,Mick Jagger.
7,8,9,LENA,No. Maya Angelou.
7,8,9,SUSAN,"Oh, the poet!"
7,8,9,JERRY,"So, let me ask you something - these people eat soup three times a day?"
7,8,9,LENA,I don't know.
7,8,9,SUSAN,"So, did you get to talk to her?"
7,8,9,LENA,Talk to who?
7,8,9,JERRY,Is it a lot of cream soups?
7,8,9,SUSAN,"Maya Angelou, the poet."
7,8,9,LENA,"No, I didn't get the chance."
7,8,9,GEORGE,"Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does a poet need an unlisted number for?"
7,8,10,SUSAN,I'm going to the ladies room.
7,8,10,LENA,I'll go with you.
7,8,10,GEORGE,What are you looking at me like that for?
7,8,10,JERRY,Why'd you have to mention 'unlisted number'?
7,8,10,GEORGE,What are you talking about?
7,8,10,JERRY,"Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan."
7,8,12,SUSAN,"Jerry got her phone number off of an AIDS walk list? Oh, that's awful!"
7,8,12,GEORGE,"I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell you."
7,8,12,SUSAN,But you told me anyway?
7,8,12,GEORGE,"Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then I'm gonna go by the rule."
7,8,12,SUSAN,"Thank you, honey."
7,8,12,GEORGE,"So, you wanna go home and...make up, officially?"
7,8,12,SUSAN,Can we stop by a drug store first?
7,8,12,GEORGE,What for?
7,8,12,SUSAN,I'm out of birth control stuff.
7,8,12,GEORGE,"Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...?"
7,8,12,SUSAN,"Oh, don't park. I'll just sit in the car, you can run in."
7,8,12,GEORGE,Me run in? Why don't you run in?
7,8,12,SUSAN,"You don't know what I use for birth control, do you?"
7,8,12,GEORGE,Of course I do.
7,8,12,SUSAN,You do? What?
7,8,12,GEORGE,"You know. You use the, uh..."
7,8,12,SUSAN,The what?
7,8,12,GEORGE,"You know, the uh..."
7,8,12,SUSAN,"Just get me some sponges, please."
7,8,12,GEORGE,"Wait, wait a minute...they don't have them anymore. I just found out, they just took them off the market."
7,8,12,SUSAN,Off the market? The sponge?
7,8,12,GEORGE,"Yeah, so you gotta use something else."
7,8,12,SUSAN,I can't! I love the sponge! I need the sponge!
7,8,12,GEORGE,O.k.... I think I know where we can get one.
7,8,13,JERRY,"Kramer, what the hell is going on in there?"
7,8,13,KRAMER,It's a poker game... And I'm kickin' some serious butt!
7,8,13,JERRY,Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!
7,8,13,KRAMER,"Oh, you gotta be kiddin'! You see those two ladies I got showin'? Do they look scared?!"
7,8,13,JERRY,You're never gonna make it!
7,8,15,BILLY,"You, uh...you wanna go in the bedroom?"
7,8,15,ELAINE,O.k. Hold on just a second.
7,8,15,GEORGE,"Elaine? It's me, George. Hey, sorry to bother you so late. Hey! How ya doin.' Uh, did you get any of those sponges?"
7,8,15,ELAINE,Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why?
7,8,15,GEORGE,Well...Susan.
7,8,15,ELAINE,"Ah, Susan uses the sponge."
7,8,15,GEORGE,Susan loves the sponge.
7,8,15,ELAINE,"Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out."
7,8,15,GEORGE,What?
7,8,15,ELAINE,"I can't do it. No way, there's no how."
7,8,15,GEORGE,"Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know about make-up sex?"
7,8,15,ELAINE,"Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry."
7,8,15,GEORGE,"Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is all that I have left."
7,8,15,ELAINE,"I'm sure you'll have another fight, George. Hold that thought!"
7,8,17,SUSAN,"So, listen to this. But don't tell anyone - Jerry Seinfeld? He got a woman's number off an AIDS walk list."
7,8,18,MONICA,He got her number off an AIDS walk list?
7,8,19,LENA,He what?
7,8,21,JERRY,How'd you find out?
7,8,21,LENA,A friend of a friend of a friend of Susan's.
7,8,21,JERRY,George!
7,8,21,LENA,Pardon?
7,8,21,JERRY,"Nothing. Listen, I'm sorry, I just -"
7,8,21,LENA,It's o.k.! There's nothing to be sorry about. I don't mind.
7,8,21,JERRY,You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?
7,8,21,LENA,"No, not at all. No problem."
7,8,21,KRAMER,"Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants on!"
7,8,21,JERRY,You went all night?
7,8,21,KRAMER,"Jerry, ah? Breakfast on me, huh?"
7,8,21,JERRY,"Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, three hours! You're never gonna make it!"
7,8,21,KRAMER,
7,8,21,JERRY,"So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number."
7,8,21,GEORGE,Really? How'd she do that?
7,8,21,JERRY,A friend of a friend of Susan's.
7,8,21,GEORGE,My Susan?
7,8,21,JERRY,Why'd you tell her?!
7,8,21,GEORGE,"Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other everything!"
7,8,21,JERRY,"Well you know what this means, don't you?"
7,8,21,GEORGE,What?
7,8,22,JERRY,"You're cut off, you're out of the loop!"
7,8,22,GEORGE,"You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off!"
7,8,22,JERRY,You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned!
7,8,22,GEORGE,"C'mon Jerry, please! It won't happen again."
7,8,22,JERRY,"If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone?"
7,8,22,GEORGE,"Hey, a ""hit"" is a totally different story."
7,8,22,JERRY,"I don't know, George."
7,8,22,GEORGE,"So, Lena was upset, huh?"
7,8,22,JERRY,You know what? That was the amazing thing.
7,8,22,GEORGE,"What, it didn't bother her?"
7,8,22,JERRY,"No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about this girl."
7,8,22,GEORGE,What?
7,8,22,JERRY,She's too good.
7,8,22,GEORGE,Too good...
7,8,22,JERRY,"I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!"
7,8,22,GEORGE,I see what you mean.
7,8,22,JERRY,"I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with someone you admire."
7,8,22,GEORGE,Where's the depravity?
7,8,22,JERRY,"No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even has sex."
7,8,23,JERRY,On the other hand...
7,8,23,ELAINE,What?
7,8,23,GEORGE,Thanks again for last night!
7,8,23,ELAINE,"Hey, I didn't even use one."
7,8,23,JERRY,I thought you said it was imminent.
7,8,23,ELAINE,"Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really sponge-worthy."
7,8,23,JERRY,Sponge-worthy?
7,8,23,ELAINE,"Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges."
7,8,23,JERRY,"But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?"
7,8,23,ELAINE,"Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste any of 'em."
7,8,23,GEORGE,"You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated!"
7,8,24,KRAMER,"Uh, Cosmo Kramer?"
7,8,24,ORGANIZER,"Uh...o.k., you're checked in. Here's your AIDS ribbon."
7,8,24,KRAMER,"Uh, no thanks."
7,8,24,ORGANIZER,You don't want to wear an AIDS ribbon?
7,8,24,KRAMER,No.
7,8,24,ORGANIZER,But you have to wear an AIDS ribbon.
7,8,24,KRAMER,I have to?
7,8,24,ORGANIZER,Yes.
7,8,24,KRAMER,"See, that's why I don't want to."
7,8,24,ORGANIZER,But everyone wears the ribbon. You must wear the ribbon!
7,8,24,KRAMER,You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully.
7,8,24,ORGANIZER,Hey you! Come back here! Come back here and put this on!
7,8,25,GEORGE,"Elaine and her sponges...she's got like, a war chest full of them."
7,8,25,SUSAN,"Well, I don't see why you just can't use condoms."
7,8,25,GEORGE,"Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever."
7,8,25,SUSAN,Just once...for the make-up sex.
7,8,25,GEORGE,"Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're way past that."
7,8,25,SUSAN,"Come on, just once?"
7,8,25,GEORGE,"No, no...I hate the condom."
7,8,25,SUSAN,Why?
7,8,25,GEORGE,I can never get the package open in time.
7,8,25,SUSAN,"Well, you just tear it open."
7,8,25,GEORGE,"It's not that easy. It's like ""Beat The Clock,"" there's a lot of pressure there."
7,8,26,WALKER #1,"Hey, where's your ribbon?"
7,8,26,KRAMER,"Oh, I don't wear the ribbon."
7,8,26,WALKER #2,"Oh, you don't wear the ribbon? Aren't you against AIDS?"
7,8,26,KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just don't wear the ribbon."
7,8,26,WALKER #3,Who do you think you are?
7,8,26,WALKER #1,Put the ribbon on!
7,8,26,WALKER #2,"Hey, Cedric! Bob! This guy won't wear a ribbon!"
7,8,26,BOB,Who? Who does not want to wear the ribbon?
7,8,27,ELAINE,"So, you think you're sponge-worthy?"
7,8,27,BILLY,"Yes, I think I'm sponge-worthy. I think I'm very sponge-worthy."
7,8,27,ELAINE,Run down your case for me again...?
7,8,27,BILLY,"Well, we've gone out several times, we obviously have a good rapport. I own a very profitable electronics distributing firm. I eat well. I exercise. Blood tests - immaculate. And if I can speak frankly, I'm actually quite good at it."
7,8,27,ELAINE,You going to do something about your sideburns?
7,8,27,BILLY,"Yeah, I told you...I'm going to trim my sideburns."
7,8,27,ELAINE,And the bathroom in your apartment?
7,8,27,BILLY,Cleaned it this morning.
7,8,27,ELAINE,"The sink, the tub, everything got cleaned?"
7,8,27,BILLY,"Everything, yeah. It's spotless."
7,8,27,ELAINE,"Alright, let's go."
7,8,28,JERRY,Hi.
7,8,28,LENA,"Hi! Hey, look at this - I just got a citation in the mail for my work with shut-ins."
7,8,28,JERRY,"Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're free to go at anytime."
7,8,28,LENA,"Oh, by the way, I checked at the soup kitchen - they do have cream soups."
7,8,28,JERRY,"Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you about something...you know, because you're such a good person"
7,8,28,LENA,"Oh, hang onto that thought - I'm rinsing a sweater, I left the water running. Hey, Jerry, can you get me a towel out of my bedroom closet?"
7,8,28,JERRY,"Oh, o.k."
7,8,28,JERRY'S BRAIN,Oh my god! Look what's goin' on here! She is depraved! There you are.
7,8,28,LENA,"Thanks. So, you were saying...?"
7,8,28,JERRY,What? Nothing.
7,8,28,LENA,"No, you said I was a good person..."
7,8,28,JERRY,Oh...
7,8,28,LENA,You seem like you want to tell me something.
7,8,28,JERRY,Tell you something...I do.
7,8,28,LENA,"What is it, Jerry? You can tell me anything."
7,8,28,JERRY,"Oh, uh...you see these jeans I'm wearing?"
7,8,28,LENA,Yeah.
7,8,28,JERRY,"I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, you know. That's it."
7,8,29,SUSAN,"Come on, George, just tear it open."
7,8,29,GEORGE,"I'm trying, dammit."
7,8,29,SUSAN,Tear it.
7,8,29,GEORGE,"I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. You gotta do it like a bag of chips."
7,8,29,SUSAN,Here give it to me.
7,8,29,GEORGE,Would you wait a second? Just wait?
7,8,29,SUSAN,Give it to me. Come on. Come on!
7,8,29,GEORGE,It's too late.
7,8,30,BOB,So! What's it going to be? Are you going to wear the ribbon?
7,8,30,KRAMER,No! Never.
7,8,30,BOB,But I am wearing the ribbon. He is wearing the ribbon. We are all wearing the ribbon! So why aren't you going to wear the ribbon!?
7,8,30,KRAMER,This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to wear!
7,8,30,CEDRIC,What are we gonna do with him?
7,8,30,BOB,I guess we are just going to have to teach him to wear the ribbon!
7,8,32,JERRY,It completely turned her off.
7,8,32,GEORGE,"Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size?"
7,8,32,JERRY,I don't wanna be a 32.
7,8,32,GEORGE,I'd kill to be a 32.
7,8,32,JERRY,She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!
7,8,32,GEORGE,That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open?
7,8,32,JERRY,It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.
7,8,32,GEORGE,"You never run out, do you? Where's Kramer? Everything's finished here."
7,8,32,JERRY,"Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer?"
7,8,33,JERRY,Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on.
7,8,33,GEORGE,"Hey, where's you AIDS ribbon?"
7,8,35,ELAINE,Good morning.
7,8,35,BILLY,How'd you sleep?
7,8,35,ELAINE,Great. You?
7,8,35,BILLY,"Fine, fine. Everything o.k.?"
7,8,35,ELAINE,Yep.
7,8,35,BILLY,No regrets?
7,8,35,ELAINE,Nope. What are you doing?
7,8,35,BILLY,What do you mean?
7,8,35,ELAINE,Oh...I don't think so.
7,8,35,BILLY,Why not? I thought you said everything was fine.
7,8,35,ELAINE,"I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em."
7,8,35,THE END,
