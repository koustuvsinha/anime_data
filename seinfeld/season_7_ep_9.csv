7,9,0,THE GUM,Written by Tom Gammill & Max Pross
7,9,1,JERRY,"I think gum is, is one of the weirdest human inventions. It's not a liquid, 's not a solid, 's not a food. What is it? It isn't really anything, you know. I mean, it's like a stationary bike for your jaw. Like, remember when you were in school, and teachers would get all riled up if they caught you with gum? And when you were a kid, you'd think 'What is the big deal?' But, as an adult, I can understand it, because when you're chewing gum, you don't look like you're too thrilled with anything anyone has to say. 'Oh, World War Two. That was an important historical event? Yeah, I'm sure.' 'They landed a man on the moon, nineteen sixty-nine? Yeah, right. Yeah, I buy that, teach.'"
7,9,3,GEORGE,You think she's happy?
7,9,3,JERRY,Who?
7,9,3,GEORGE,The cashier.
7,9,3,JERRY,Ruthie Cohen?
7,9,3,GEORGE,You know her name?
7,9,3,JERRY,Sure.
7,9,3,GEORGE,I don't think I've ever spoken to her.
7,9,3,JERRY,Maybe that's why she's happy.
7,9,4,KRAMER,"Good morning, gentlemen."
7,9,4,JERRY,What is this?
7,9,4,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from the Alex"
7,9,5,JERRY,That stinky old movie-house?
7,9,5,KRAMER,"Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up the place."
7,9,5,GEORGE,With Spartacus?
7,9,5,KRAMER,"Well, it's a rare archival print. Twelve extra minutes, full wide-screen CinemaScope, and if you come to the one o'clock show, you can hear Geoffrey Har-harwood."
7,9,5,JERRY,Geoffrey who?
7,9,5,KRAMER,"Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some fascinating insights into the production."
7,9,5,GEORGE,Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch on TV?
7,9,5,KRAMER,"Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill? Listen, you guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun, have you? I'm supposed to meet him here."
7,9,5,GEORGE,Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?
7,9,5,KRAMER,"Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, get the theatre landmark status."
7,9,5,JERRY,I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.
7,9,5,KRAMER,"Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown? Had to spend a few months in an institution."
7,9,5,GEORGE,Really?
7,9,5,KRAMER,"Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my wing."
7,9,5,JERRY,"Oh, then I'm not worried."
7,9,6,KRAMER,"But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here treat him like he's one of the gang, huh."
7,9,7,GEORGE,"Breakdown, huh?"
7,9,7,LLOYD,Hey Kramer.
7,9,7,KRAMER,"Oh, hey Lloyd, hey buddy."
7,9,7,LLOYD,How you doing?
7,9,7,KRAMER,Sit down.
7,9,7,LLOYD,Hi Jerry.
7,9,7,JERRY,Lloyd.
7,9,7,LLOYD,George.
7,9,8,GEORGE,"Hello, Lloyd. How you doing?"
7,9,8,KRAMER,"Yeah well, he's doing fine, George."
7,9,8,LLOYD,Gum?
7,9,8,JERRY,That's an interesting package.
7,9,8,LLOYD,"Yeah, it's from China. Go ahead, try a piece. Tell me that's not the most delicious gum you've ever tasted."
7,9,8,KRAMER,"Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious it is."
7,9,8,LLOYD,George?
7,9,8,GEORGE,I don't chew gum.
7,9,8,JERRY,"Mmm, different. Where'd you get it?"
7,9,8,LLOYD,Friend of mine in Chinatown gave it to me. If you want I can ask him where he got it.
7,9,8,JERRY,"Nah, don't bother."
7,9,8,LLOYD,"No, it's no problem."
7,9,8,JERRY,I don't want it.
7,9,8,KRAMER,"Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating the gum."
7,9,8,JERRY,Alright.
7,9,8,KRAMER,"Mmm, delicious. This is delicious. Mmm."
7,9,10,GEORGE,You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change.
7,9,12,ELAINE,Hey.
7,9,12,GEORGE,Hey.
7,9,12,JERRY,I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a little lo-mein-y
7,9,12,ELAINE,What kind is that?
7,9,12,JERRY,"It's Chinese gum, Lloyd Braun gave me."
7,9,12,ELAINE,Lloyd Braun? How's he doing?
7,9,12,GEORGE,"After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete nervous breakdown. They had to lock him up."
7,9,12,ELAINE,"You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. Y... you don't think that I had anything to do with his breakdown, do you?"
7,9,12,JERRY,"You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently for months."
7,9,12,ELAINE,"Yeah? Well, I got news for you."
7,9,12,GEORGE,"The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my mother was 'Why can't you be more like that Lloyd Braun?'"
7,9,12,JERRY,And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you.
7,9,13,GEORGE,"Right, gotta get going."
7,9,13,JERRY,Aren't you coming with us to Spartacus?
7,9,13,GEORGE,"Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents."
7,9,13,JERRY,I thought your parents were outta town?
7,9,13,GEORGE,Why d'you think I'm going now?
7,9,16,POP,Georgie!
7,9,16,GEORGE,"Hey, Mr Lazzari."
7,9,16,POP,"Back in the old neighborhood, ah?"
7,9,16,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks."
7,9,16,POP,"Oh, snazzy car. Le Baron?"
7,9,16,GEORGE,"Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight."
7,9,16,POP,"The actor, right?"
7,9,16,GEORGE,Something like that.
7,9,16,POP,Mind if I look under the hood?
7,9,16,GEORGE,"Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars."
7,9,17,POP,"Oh, Deena! Deena, Deena, l... look who's here."
7,9,18,DEENA,"George Costanza, is that you?"
7,9,18,GEORGE,"Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug. Oh my gosh, you look as"
7,9,19,DEENA,"Boy, those were some crazy times."
7,9,19,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?"
7,9,23,KRAMER,"The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden era of"
7,9,25,ELAINE,"Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?"
7,9,25,KRAMER,"Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark"
7,9,26,JERRY,"Oh, can Lloyd really do that?"
7,9,26,KRAMER,"Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry. (to"
7,9,27,ELAINE,What? Lloyd is here?
7,9,28,ELAINE,"What? No, no, I'd rather..."
7,9,28,LLOYD,Hi Elaine.
7,9,28,ELAINE,"Lloyd, yes. Hello."
7,9,28,LLOYD,"Kramer tell you? We reserved some special seats, so we can all sit"
7,9,29,ELAINE,"Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have to sit"
7,9,33,LLOYD,"That was odd. Am I crazy, or does Jerry not wear glasses?"
7,9,33,KRAMER,You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot
7,9,36,JERRY,We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the special
7,9,37,ELAINE,"I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again."
7,9,40,JERRY,"Nah, you don't wanna be uncomfortable."
7,9,43,DEENA,Poor Lloyd.
7,9,43,GEORGE,I know. Completely bonkers!
7,9,43,DEENA,"Sorry I can't be so flip about this kind of thing. You know, after what"
7,9,44,GEORGE,Pop? What happened to Pop?
7,9,44,DEENA,I thought you heard. He had a nervous breakdown last year. That's why I'm
7,9,46,POP,"Oh, I tell you, they don't build 'em like this any more."
7,9,47,GEORGE,"He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?"
7,9,47,DEENA,"Uhn, it was too much for him."
7,9,48,GEORGE,"Uhm, I, I gotta go."
7,9,48,DEENA,What?
7,9,48,GEORGE,"I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough. Pop."
7,9,60,GEORGE,Pop! POP!!
7,9,63,LLOYD,"'s a great movie, huh?"
7,9,63,KRAMER,Yeah.
7,9,63,LLOYD,Sorry you forgot those glasses.
7,9,63,JERRY,I don't know what I was thinking.
7,9,63,LLOYD,How'd you like that gum?
7,9,63,JERRY,Errh.
7,9,63,KRAMER,"Ah, he loved it."
7,9,66,ELAINE,"Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, in the"
7,9,67,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah. It's being repaired."
7,9,69,ELAINE,Oh. Oh God.
7,9,69,LLOYD,You alright?
7,9,71,ELAINE,"Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot"
7,9,78,ELAINE,"Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a"
7,9,81,COP,"Lady, you sold me. Hey, you with the hose."
7,9,86,KRAMER,"Yeah, put these glasses on."
7,9,86,JERRY,"Well, what's this for?"
7,9,86,KRAMER,"Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now."
7,9,86,JERRY,So what?
7,9,86,KRAMER,"Well, he thinks you wear those."
7,9,87,KRAMER,They're from the lost and found at the Alex.
7,9,87,JERRY,"Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on."
7,9,87,KRAMER,Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit with him on
7,9,91,GEORGE,"'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe I paid you"
7,9,92,CASHIER,I don't think so.
7,9,92,GEORGE,"Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill"
7,9,94,CASHIER,Not unless you buy something.
7,9,94,GEORGE,"Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum."
7,9,96,LLOYD,Hey George. Thought you didn't chew gum?
7,9,96,GEORGE,I don't.
7,9,97,CASHIER,Take a look.
7,9,99,GEORGE,I know I gave it to you.
7,9,99,LLOYD,"George, would you mind. I'm kind of in a hurry."
7,9,100,GEORGE,Fine. Fine. Excuse me.
7,9,105,KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry, look who's here."
7,9,107,JERRY,"Ah, Lloyd."
7,9,107,LLOYD,Hi Jerry. Got some more of that gum.
7,9,108,JERRY,"Oh, the gum."
7,9,108,KRAMER,"Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?"
7,9,108,JERRY,"Uh, alright."
7,9,108,KRAMER,"Oh, boy."
7,9,109,KRAMER,"Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, sitting"
7,9,112,JERRY,"Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish"
7,9,114,LLOYD,"Actually, the importer's right in Chinatown. I'll introduce you to him,"
7,9,115,JERRY,'s not necessary.
7,9,115,KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour."
7,9,115,JERRY,"I know that, Kramer."
7,9,115,LLOYD,"Well, if you don't want to..."
7,9,115,KRAMER,"No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, he"
7,9,116,JERRY,"Yes I do, Kramer."
7,9,116,LLOYD,So...
7,9,116,KRAMER,Yeah?
7,9,116,LLOYD,"How about that Elaine today, huh?"
7,9,116,KRAMER,"Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?"
7,9,116,LLOYD,She was practically undressing in front of me at the theatre.
7,9,116,JERRY,I didn't see anything.
7,9,116,KRAMER,"Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom,"
7,9,121,DEENA,You're probably wondering why I wanted to see you again.
7,9,122,GEORGE,"Well, you know. It's understandable."
7,9,123,DEENA,"I'm glad you feel that way. Because since my father's breakdown I uh,"
7,9,124,GEORGE,Warning signs?
7,9,124,DEENA,"Nervousness, irritability, paranoia."
7,9,124,GEORGE,What? Wh... what're you talking about? I'm not the
7,9,125,DEENA,"Yet again, taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others."
7,9,125,GEORGE,All my friends do that.
7,9,125,DEENA,"George, I'm only trying to help..."
7,9,126,DEENA,"I'm... I'm concerned. George? George, are you listening to me?"
7,9,126,GEORGE,You see that woman on the horse?
7,9,127,GEORGE,"She stole twenty dollars from me. Yeah, I might've"
7,9,128,DEENA,So again it all comes back to Lloyd.
7,9,128,GEORGE,"Hey! Hey, you! Come back"
7,9,132,JERRY,So you say she was on a horse?
7,9,132,GEORGE,"I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money."
7,9,132,JERRY,"Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. See if"
7,9,135,ELAINE,Hey.
7,9,135,JERRY,"Well, if it isn't Chesty La Rue."
7,9,135,ELAINE,What?
7,9,135,JERRY,"I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the"
7,9,136,ELAINE,"Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open."
7,9,137,JERRY,Maybe it's in the lost and found.
7,9,137,ELAINE,"Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button too,"
7,9,138,JERRY,"You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it."
7,9,140,KRAMER,"Mr Har-harwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you back at"
7,9,141,HAARWOOD,"Well I, I'm in a bit of a quandary. I've misplaced my spectacles."
7,9,141,KRAMER,"Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?"
7,9,142,HAARWOOD,They're half-glasses.
7,9,143,KRAMER,Brown?
7,9,143,HAARWOOD,"Mmm, yes, yes."
7,9,144,KRAMER,"Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll turn up"
7,9,146,HAARWOOD,Certainly.
7,9,149,HAARWOOD,Oh my goodness. What a spanking button.
7,9,153,GEORGE,Alright. Alright.
7,9,154,GEORGE,"Hang on, it's warming up!"
7,9,156,GEORGE,Oh you mother...
7,9,158,GEORGE,Hey! What is your problem?
7,9,159,GEORGE,"Oh, hello, it's you! Listen lady, I got six minutes left on that"
7,9,161,CASHIER,Your car's on fire.
7,9,163,GEORGE,Aah! Fire!
7,9,163,CASHIER,Merry Christmas!
7,9,164,GEORGE,Fire!!
7,9,165,GEORGE,Your hose! Where's your hose?!
7,9,165,FLORIST,Cop made me disconnect it.
7,9,172,KRAMER,"Jeez! What happened to your car, buddy?"
7,9,172,GEORGE,The Jon Voight car is no more.
7,9,172,KRAMER,"Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you want to."
7,9,172,GEORGE,No kidding?
7,9,172,KRAMER,No kidding.
7,9,172,GEORGE,"Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one."
7,9,172,KRAMER,"Yeah, merry Christmas."
7,9,173,GEORGE,Whatever.
7,9,175,JERRY,"Alright, I'm here. Where's Braun?"
7,9,175,KRAMER,"What, he's not here yet?"
7,9,175,JERRY,"Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!"
7,9,175,KRAMER,"Listen, I'm gonna need those glasses."
7,9,176,JERRY,Why?
7,9,176,KRAMER,They're Geoffrey Haarwood's.
7,9,177,KRAMER,"Here, try this pair."
7,9,180,JERRY,"Aw, these are really strong glasses."
7,9,181,LLOYD,Hey gum-buddy. Nice frames. You ready to go?
7,9,181,JERRY,"Yeah, yeah."
7,9,181,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, he's all ready to go."
7,9,181,LLOYD,Anybody see Elaine today?
7,9,181,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check out"
7,9,182,LLOYD,"Maybe I'll stick around and see what she's wearing today. Or not wearing,"
7,9,184,JERRY,Absolutely. Let's just stick around.
7,9,184,LLOYD,"Ah, tell you what, they're expecting us though. Lemme just grab a hotdog"
7,9,185,KRAMER,"Uh, yeah."
7,9,186,LLOYD,"I'd like a hotdog, please."
7,9,189,ATTENDANT,Are you outta your mind?
7,9,190,KRAMER,Wh...wh...wh... what's the problem here?
7,9,190,ATTENDANT,This hotdog's been here since the silent era. You'd have to be insane
7,9,191,KRAMER,"No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing wrong"
7,9,192,LLOYD,"Kramer, maybe..."
7,9,192,KRAMER,"No, no, no, no. I'll show you. One"
7,9,193,ATTENDANT,Okay.
7,9,193,KRAMER,"Mmm, doesn't that smell good, huh?"
7,9,194,KRAMER,"Yeah, here we go, yeah. Mmm, oh. That's delicious."
7,9,197,KRAMER,"Uhm, interesting texture. It's chewy. I"
7,9,209,ELAINE,"Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?"
7,9,209,FLORIST,How would you happen to know that?
7,9,209,ELAINE,"Well, uhm... I..."
7,9,209,FLORIST,"You're that lady that was talking to the cops, aren't you?"
7,9,209,ELAINE,Uh... I...
7,9,210,VOICE,"Hey, Joe!"
7,9,212,ELAINE,"No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me!"
7,9,217,ELAINE,Hey. Hey everybody.
7,9,217,LLOYD,"Whoah, Elaine! Once again, you've managed to top yourself. C'mon Jerry,"
7,9,220,JERRY,Lloyd?
7,9,221,JERRY,Lloyd?
7,9,222,ELAINE,What is Lloyd's problem?
7,9,222,KRAMER,"Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, but this"
7,9,223,ELAINE,"Uhh, I got sprayed with a hose."
7,9,223,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not one of your"
7,9,228,DEENA,"So, you want my father to pay for this?"
7,9,228,GEORGE,You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what he did
7,9,229,DEENA,And I suppose Lloyd Braun had something to do with it too.
7,9,229,GEORGE,"No, not Lloyd Braun. But the cashier."
7,9,229,DEENA,What cashier?
7,9,229,GEORGE,You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.
7,9,229,DEENA,To park her horse?
7,9,229,GEORGE,"No, she wasn't on the horse."
7,9,229,DEENA,"So, your car caught fire because of my father and the woman on the horse?"
7,9,229,GEORGE,That's right.
7,9,230,GEORGE,And him!
7,9,230,DEENA,The man with the flowers?
7,9,230,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a little"
7,9,232,GEORGE,"I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld."
7,9,232,DEENA,Who?
7,9,232,GEORGE,Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this. (calls to
7,9,235,GEORGE,Jerry! Over here Jerry. It's me!
7,9,236,GEORGE,"Jerry, where y'going? It's... what're..."
7,9,236,DEENA,That was your best friend?
7,9,236,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses."
7,9,236,DEENA,That man was wearing glasses.
7,9,236,GEORGE,I know. Don't you see. He was doing it to fool Lloyd Braun!
7,9,238,LLOYD,I'll run in and get the gum.
7,9,238,JERRY,Alright.
7,9,238,LLOYD,Got any money?
7,9,241,JERRY,Here.
7,9,242,LLOYD,I'll be back.
7,9,244,GEORGE,"Look, Deena, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. This is just a"
7,9,245,DEENA,"I don't know, George. I don't know what to believe."
7,9,245,GEORGE,"Believe me, I am not crazy."
7,9,245,DEENA,"Well, I guess it's possible."
7,9,248,LLOYD,Here y'go.
7,9,248,JERRY,Got all this?
7,9,248,LLOYD,Yeah. A hundred dollar's worth.
7,9,248,JERRY,I gave you a hundred dollars?!
7,9,248,LLOYD,"You sure did. Am I crazy, or is that a lotta gum?"
7,9,248,JERRY,It's a lotta gum!
7,9,250,KRAMER,Mr Hararwood. Found your glasses.
7,9,250,HAARWOOD,"Oh, splendid. Welcome to the Institute for the Preservation of Motion"
7,9,251,KRAMER,"Ah, the I.P.M.P.C.W."
7,9,251,HAARWOOD,"Well eh, we prefer to call it the Institute."
7,9,252,KRAMER,Is that from Henry the Eighth?
7,9,252,HAARWOOD,"Yes, yes, it is."
7,9,252,KRAMER,"Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think"
7,9,253,HAARWOOD,"Well, I... I'd love to lend it to you, but I doubt if it would fit a"
7,9,256,KRAMER,You don't say.
7,9,259,KRAMER,"You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna be so"
7,9,260,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick."
7,9,260,KRAMER,"Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing."
7,9,260,GEORGE,"Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait a minute,"
7,9,262,GEORGE,"Can I get a pack of gum, please?"
7,9,262,GUY,"I beg your pardon, your majesty, but we don't accept bills with lipstick on"
7,9,263,GEORGE,"What? Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that? I guess"
