8,11,3,KRAMER,"Well, that was alright, huh?"
8,11,3,EMILY,Yeah.
8,11,3,KRAMER,"Well, um, goodnight."
8,11,3,EMILY,Goodnight.
8,11,6,THE CLOCK READS 3,"31. Kramer is lying on his back, sleeping. Beside him,"
8,11,10,KRAMER,Look at this.
8,11,14,THE CLOCK READS 5,11. A wide awake Kramer is right over to the edge of the
8,11,20,HELEN,"Jerry, we can only stay four days."
8,11,20,JERRY,"Well, I'm upset, but we'll make the most of it."
8,11,21,MORTY,"Helen, did you pack my travel gym?"
8,11,21,HELEN,"Yes. Oh, your father bought a exercise device off the"
8,11,22,MORTY,"Only twenty-five minutes a day, and you can attach it to any"
8,11,23,JERRY,"Huh. So, I guess your travel miles are about to expire."
8,11,25,HELEN,"Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted to talk to you about something."
8,11,26,JERRY,Am I finally getting a baby brother?
8,11,26,HELEN,"Jerry, be serious."
8,11,26,MORTY,How would you feel if we sold the Cadillac?
8,11,26,JERRY,What? The Cadillac I bought for you?
8,11,26,MORTY,"It's too much car, Jerry."
8,11,26,JERRY,"Aw, c'mon, you love that car. What about the Northstar system?"
8,11,26,MORTY,I don't think we even use it.
8,11,26,JERRY,"Well, it's a gift and I want you to keep it."
8,11,26,HELEN,We already sold it.
8,11,26,JERRY,Wh..why didn't you tell me before you sold it?
8,11,26,MORTY,"Because we had a buyer, and we couldn't get a free flight until now."
8,11,26,HELEN,"Well, we could, but we wanted the bulkhead."
8,11,26,JERRY,Ugh.
8,11,27,KRAMER,"Man, that Emily is wearing me out."
8,11,27,JERRY,Kramer.
8,11,27,KRAMER,"No, no, no. It's not the sex, Jerry."
8,11,28,HELEN,Hi Kramer.
8,11,28,MORTY,Hiya Kramer.
8,11,28,JERRY,We're in the middle of a discussion here.
8,11,28,KRAMER,Oh yeah? What about?
8,11,28,HELEN,Jerry's upset we sold the Cadillac.
8,11,28,KRAMER,What'd you get for it?
8,11,28,MORTY,Jack Klompus gave us six grand.
8,11,29,JERRY,You sold my Cadillac to Jack Klompus?
8,11,30,MORTY,And we want you to have the
8,11,31,JERRY,I don't need the money.
8,11,31,MORTY,What're you talking about? You had a cheque bounce at the bodega.
8,11,31,JERRY,"Oh, is that what this is all about?! I bounce a cheque and"
8,11,32,HELEN,"Well, also, Jerry, we read an article in the Sun Sentinel. (digs in"
8,11,35,KRAMER,"Yeah, that def jam is a force."
8,11,35,HELEN,"Jerry, you know, I hear wonderful things about Bloomingdales'"
8,11,36,JERRY,Oh my god.
8,11,36,KRAMER,"Y'know you've given this comedy thing your best shot. Yeah, you had"
8,11,42,GEORGE,"Uh, excuse me. Uh, pound of Arabian mocha java, please."
8,11,43,ELAINE,"So, you understand how my Peterman stock options are gonna work?"
8,11,43,GEORGE,I'm going to the bathroom.
8,11,44,ELAINE,"Just, very interesting."
8,11,44,JERRY,"Yeah, when it's your money, it's fascinating."
8,11,45,COUNTERPERSON,Arabian mocha java?
8,11,45,ELAINE,"Mmm. Oh, um, I got it."
8,11,46,JERRY,That Arabian is strong coffee.
8,11,46,ELAINE,It's PLO blend.
8,11,47,ELAINE,"Ohh, I got your coffee."
8,11,48,GEORGE,"Oh Oh, here, lemme uh..."
8,11,48,ELAINE,"Nah, nah, it's on me. Aww, man."
8,11,50,GEORGE,Yeah.
8,11,50,ELAINE,Bye.
8,11,50,GEORGE,Mmm.
8,11,52,GEORGE,You see what just happened here?
8,11,52,JERRY,What?
8,11,52,GEORGE,She treated me to the Arabian mocha java.
8,11,52,JERRY,And you misinterpret this how?
8,11,52,GEORGE,She's stickin' it to me that she makes more money than me.
8,11,52,JERRY,"I'm sure she was just being nice, buying you the coffee."
8,11,52,GEORGE,"No, not nice. She's stickin' it to me."
8,11,52,JERRY,You're crazy.
8,11,52,GEORGE,"Stickin' it to me, Jerry."
8,11,52,JERRY,George.
8,11,52,GEORGE,Stickin' it!
8,11,55,GEORGE,So you're buying the car back for your parents?
8,11,55,JERRY,I'm flying down to Florida tomorrow.
8,11,55,GEORGE,Your parents'll never let you do it.
8,11,55,JERRY,They lied to me about selling the car. I'll lie to them about buying
8,11,56,GEORGE,What kind of money you think your parents have?
8,11,56,JERRY,Excuse me?
8,11,56,GEORGE,I bet they have more money than mine.
8,11,56,JERRY,"Come on, your parents have money."
8,11,56,GEORGE,You think?
8,11,56,JERRY,When did they ever spend any money?
8,11,56,GEORGE,Never.
8,11,56,JERRY,What are their living expenses?
8,11,56,GEORGE,Nothing.
8,11,56,JERRY,Where do they ever go on vacation?
8,11,56,GEORGE,Nowhere.
8,11,57,GEORGE,How much money d'you think they have?
8,11,57,JERRY,Few hundred grand?
8,11,57,GEORGE,You're saying I stand to inherit three hundred thousand
8,11,58,JERRY,Course you may not see it for twenty years.
8,11,58,GEORGE,Twenty years? That long?
8,11,58,JERRY,Does your father still eat bacon and eggs every day?
8,11,58,GEORGE,"Fortunately, yes."
8,11,58,JERRY,How's your family history?
8,11,58,GEORGE,I have an aunt that died at seven.
8,11,58,JERRY,Really?
8,11,58,GEORGE,Aunt Baby.
8,11,61,KRAMER,"Elaine. Uh, you got a moment?"
8,11,61,ELAINE,"Yeah, Kramer, come on in."
8,11,61,KRAMER,
8,11,62,ELAINE,Oh-kay.
8,11,62,KRAMER,"You know, after I have sex with Emily, uh, I"
8,11,63,ELAINE,Ah.
8,11,63,KRAMER,"Yeah, because she's throwing off my whole sleep. She's got the jimmy"
8,11,64,ELAINE,Jimmy legs?
8,11,65,KRAMER,Jimmy leg.
8,11,65,ELAINE,Ohh.
8,11,65,KRAMER,"So, uh, well, maybe I should just be honest with her, huh?"
8,11,65,ELAINE,"Tell her after sex, you just want her outta there?"
8,11,65,KRAMER,"Well, I'd say it nicely."
8,11,65,ELAINE,I don't think so.
8,11,65,KRAMER,"Well, you know, I really like this girl and I, you know, I think if"
8,11,66,ELAINE,Yeah. I gotta be honest with you Kramer. You might be
8,11,67,KRAMER,"Well you're not exactly zeroing in yourself, lady."
8,11,67,ELAINE,"Alright, get out."
8,11,69,ELAINE,Get out!
8,11,72,JERRY,"So listen, I gotta go down to Atlantic City. I'm performing at"
8,11,73,MORTY,You just heard about this today?
8,11,73,JERRY,They had a cancellation and they instantly
8,11,74,HELEN,Who cancelled?
8,11,74,JERRY,"Carrot Top. I told you, my career's fine."
8,11,77,GEORGE,"I been, uh, thinking about the family. Tell me, uh, about Aunt Baby."
8,11,77,FRANK,She's deceased.
8,11,77,GEORGE,"Yeah. Uhm, why did she die so young?"
8,11,77,FRANK,She had problems. Internal.
8,11,77,GEORGE,Is that common in our family?
8,11,77,ESTELLE,"Well, your uncle Moe, he died a young man."
8,11,77,FRANK,Also internal problems.
8,11,77,ESTELLE,"It's that temper on your side. They're yelling and yelling, and"
8,11,78,FRANK,What about your side? Your cousin Hennie. She was sickly
8,11,79,ESTELLE,Don't you talk about Hennie!
8,11,79,GEORGE,I guess you two are the lucky ones.
8,11,79,FRANK,So far.
8,11,79,ESTELLE,"Frank, if Aunt Baby were alive today, how old would she be?"
8,11,79,FRANK,She'd never make it.
8,11,82,EMILY,So let me get this straight. You enjoy the lovemaking...
8,11,82,KRAMER,"Shh, shh."
8,11,82,EMILY,"Well, do you?"
8,11,82,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, like strawberry pie."
8,11,82,EMILY,"Okay, but you have a problem sharing a bed with me?"
8,11,82,KRAMER,I know it's not what the ladies like. But without some solid sack
8,11,83,EMILY,I don't know.
8,11,83,KRAMER,"Aww, c'mon, man. Meet me halfway."
8,11,83,EMILY,"You're not easy, Kramer."
8,11,83,KRAMER,I know.
8,11,88,JACK,"So, to what do I owe the pleasure of this, unannounced, visit?"
8,11,88,JERRY,I wanna buy back the Cadillac.
8,11,88,JACK,"You wanna buy it back? Why, you go drugs hidden in the trunk?"
8,11,89,JACK,I'm kidding.
8,11,89,JERRY,"Alright, I'll give you nine thousand for"
8,11,91,JACK,Nine thousand for a Cadillac? It's got no miles on it.
8,11,91,JERRY,You bought it for six!
8,11,91,JACK,You're not me.
8,11,91,JERRY,How much d'you want for it?
8,11,91,JACK,The Kelly blue book value. Twenty-two thousand dollars.
8,11,92,JERRY,Fourteen thousand.
8,11,92,JACK,"Done. But, I get to drive it tomorrow, because Doris wants to go to"
8,11,96,JACK,Need a pen?
8,11,98,JACK,Still works.
8,11,100,KRAMER,"Hey, where's Jerry?"
8,11,100,HELEN,He's performing at Bally's in Atlantic City.
8,11,100,KRAMER,"Aw, okay. Yeah, I need his"
8,11,103,MORTY,You know that number?
8,11,103,KRAMER,"I used to have a problem. Well, what d'you mean, he's"
8,11,104,KRAMER,
8,11,106,HELEN,He's not there?
8,11,106,KRAMER,"No, they never heard of him."
8,11,110,ELAINE,"This is so nice of you to take us all out to dinner, George."
8,11,110,GEORGE,"Well, as much as I enjoy all the"
8,11,112,HELEN,Where's Jerry?
8,11,112,GEORGE,"Oh, he'll be here. By the way, Elaine, (reaches under the table and"
8,11,115,ELAINE,"George, you didn't have to do this. I'm president of a big company."
8,11,116,MORTY,President?
8,11,116,ELAINE,Yeah.
8,11,117,GEORGE,"Hey look, he's back."
8,11,117,JERRY,"I got your message, so I came straight from Atlantic City."
8,11,117,HELEN,"Jerry, Kramer called Bally's. You weren't registered."
8,11,117,JERRY,"Well, I can't stay under my own name. I was"
8,11,120,GEORGE,Mom? Dad?
8,11,120,ESTELLE,"Well, look who's here. Hello, Seinfelds."
8,11,121,GEORGE,Wh..what're you doing here?
8,11,121,FRANK,We're having an upscale dinner.
8,11,121,GEORGE,What?
8,11,121,ESTELLE,"Well, after talking to you, we realised we may not have much time"
8,11,122,FRANK,"So, we're blowing it all."
8,11,123,FRANK,"Look George, it's a Pierre Cardin."
8,11,125,KRAMER,That was alright.
8,11,125,EMILY,Yeah.
8,11,126,KRAMER,"Well, I'll see you."
8,11,143,JERRY,Hello.
8,11,145,JACK,"Jerry, I had a little mishap with"
8,11,148,JACK,I'm down here in alligator alley. You better get down here.
8,11,149,JERRY,Huh. Alright.
8,11,150,HELEN,Who was that?
8,11,150,JERRY,That was the Golden Nugget. Also in Atlantic City.
8,11,154,MORTY,That didn't sound like the Golden Nugget.
8,11,154,HELEN,I'm worried. What happens if we have to support Jerry?
8,11,154,MORTY,I'd have to go back to work.
8,11,154,HELEN,Where would you work?
8,11,154,MORTY,Maybe I should talk to Elaine.
8,11,156,ELAINE,"Well, Mr Seinfeld, I..I'm not sure I understand why you want a job"
8,11,157,MORTY,What's not to understand?
8,11,157,ELAINE,"Well, for one thing, you live in Florida."
8,11,157,MORTY,"I'm very comfortable working outta the house. I have a phone, we have"
8,11,158,ELAINE,Where is your resume?
8,11,158,MORTY,I don't have it. I'll mail you one.
8,11,158,ELAINE,"Alright, Mr Seinfeld, I... What kind of position did you have in"
8,11,159,MORTY,"You sell clothes here, don't you?"
8,11,159,ELAINE,Yeah.
8,11,159,MORTY,"Well, I sold raincoats in the garment centre for thirty-eight years."
8,11,160,ELAINE,"Alright. Alright, alright. You come in tomorrow,"
8,11,161,MORTY,"You won't regret this, Miss Benes. What time should I be in? I get up"
8,11,162,ELAINE,Uhm...
8,11,163,PETERMAN,"Oh, Elaine, this dry air is curing me like a Black Forest"
8,11,165,ELAINE,Mr Peterman. You're back.
8,11,167,MORTY,Who's Mr Fancy?
8,11,169,KRAMER,"I uh, I was thinking maybe I should spend the night."
8,11,169,EMILY,"Aww, that's sweet, but actually I, I think I'd prefer it if you left."
8,11,169,KRAMER,What?
8,11,169,EMILY,You were completely right. I sleep so much better when I'm alone.
8,11,170,KRAMER,I do?
8,11,171,KRAMER,"There was a man, he was trying to get into my apartment"
8,11,172,EMILY,"C'mon, it was probably the wind."
8,11,172,KRAMER,"No, no, no. It was a fearless cat burglar. Now listen,"
8,11,174,EMILY,"Well, I do."
8,11,180,JACK,What took you so long?
8,11,180,JERRY,I live in New York. What the hell happened?
8,11,181,JACK,"This thing is a, is a behemoth."
8,11,181,JERRY,What did you do?
8,11,181,JACK,"I was, I was making a, a simple lane change. I, I put on the blinker"
8,11,185,JERRY,"You are such an idiot. Well, we gotta get the car"
8,11,186,JACK,Do whatever you want. It's your car.
8,11,186,JERRY,My car? You drove it into the swamp!
8,11,186,JACK,"It drove itself into the swamp! Besides, I think I lost my pen, too."
8,11,186,JERRY,"You know, that almost makes this all"
8,11,190,GEORGE,Why is there a Cadillac parked in front of the
8,11,191,FRANK,That's your mother's new car.
8,11,191,GEORGE,You bought that?
8,11,191,FRANK,It's a Coupe de Elegance.
8,11,191,ESTELLE,"Your father wanted a Mercedes, but I won't ride in a German car."
8,11,194,KRAMER,Mornin'.
8,11,195,KRAMER,"Oh, boy."
8,11,195,GEORGE,What the hell is going on here?
8,11,195,KRAMER,"I had some trouble at my place, so I need a little company at night"
8,11,196,ESTELLE,"George, your mother and I, and Kramer have"
8,11,197,GEORGE,Oh god.
8,11,197,KRAMER,"Uh, George, your parents can't blow through their savings in this"
8,11,199,FRANK,"You can drop a grand in Disneyworld, like that."
8,11,199,GEORGE,Wait a minute. You're thinking of moving to Florida
8,11,200,ESTELLE,"Well, it's either that or we stay here, near you, and just sit on"
8,11,206,PETERMAN,"So, anyway, effective immediately, Miss Benes will return to her"
8,11,208,PETERMAN,"...and I, of course, will return to mine. Kudos, Elaine, on a"
8,11,209,ELAINE,What about my stock options?
8,11,209,PETERMAN,I think not.
8,11,210,PETERMAN,"Now, down to business. I have had this vision of a"
8,11,212,ELAINE,"Well, we could fly some fabric in from our silk factories, for about"
8,11,213,MORTY,A thousand?! I know a coupla Chinamen over there on
8,11,214,ELAINE,"It's, ah, Asian-Americans."
8,11,214,MORTY,What?
8,11,214,PETERMAN,Who are you?
8,11,214,ELAINE,"Don't worry, I..."
8,11,214,MORTY,Morty Seinfeld. I cut velvet for forty years with Harry Altman.
8,11,214,ELAINE,"Okay, Mr Seinfeld, this is not the t..."
8,11,214,PETERMAN,"Elaine, did you hire this man?"
8,11,214,ELAINE,"No, no. Well, I mean, you know, he's more like an intern,"
8,11,217,ELAINE,"So, if your parents move to Florida, you're poor."
8,11,217,GEORGE,But happy.
8,11,217,ELAINE,"Obviously. And if they stay, you're rich, but..."
8,11,218,GEORGE,Obviously.
8,11,218,ELAINE,"Quite a dilemma. You know, I have a bit of a dilemma of my own."
8,11,218,GEORGE,"No, no. No, no, no. We're staying on me. We haven't"
8,11,219,ELAINE,"Alright, this is easy. Let 'em go."
8,11,219,GEORGE,"What d'you mean, let 'em go? They're spending all my money."
8,11,219,ELAINE,"Alright, well, then they stay. Lemma ask you something..."
8,11,219,GEORGE,"Could you put a little thought into this? Jerry's gone, you"
8,11,220,ELAINE,"Speaking of Jerry, his father is driving me so crazy down at"
8,11,221,GEORGE,"You know what I do at the Yankees, when one of these old guys is"
8,11,222,ELAINE,What?
8,11,222,GEORGE,You schedule a late meeting.
8,11,222,ELAINE,Huh? What does that do?
8,11,222,GEORGE,"These old guys, they're up at 4 a.m., by two thirty they're wiped."
8,11,223,ELAINE,I gotta split.
8,11,224,GEORGE,"You know, I got nothing outta this!"
8,11,227,KRAMER,"Hey Frank, you got two beds in here."
8,11,227,FRANK,That's right. That's me on the left.
8,11,227,KRAMER,"So, you sleep in separate beds."
8,11,227,FRANK,"Thirty years ago, we came to an agreement. It was the only way I"
8,11,228,KRAMER,Really?
8,11,228,FRANK,Estelle's got the jimmy arms.
8,11,228,KRAMER,You can get that in your arms?
8,11,228,FRANK,Like you wouldn't believe.
8,11,230,JACK,"Jerry, it's getting late. You've cleaned up the car. You've made all"
8,11,231,JERRY,"Well, I uh, maxed out my credit cards, and I don't have enough cash"
8,11,232,JACK,"You are uh, thinking of staying here?"
8,11,232,JERRY,Well...
8,11,232,JACK,You've got some nerve. I almost break my neck in that
8,11,233,JERRY,You didn't like that crack about the pen.
8,11,233,JACK,I did not.
8,11,236,GEORGE,"Well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've gotta say..."
8,11,238,GEORGE,As much as I'd like to see the two of you
8,11,240,FRANK,It's too late. We bought a condo at Del Boca Vista. We're leaving
8,11,242,GEORGE,But you said it was my call.
8,11,242,ESTELLE,We were just being nice.
8,11,243,ESTELLE,"Cosmo, are you sure you're gonna be alright here"
8,11,244,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah, yeah. I got Emily coming over tonight."
8,11,244,GEORGE,You're letting him have a woman over?!
8,11,244,FRANK,"He's not family. It's different, psychologically."
8,11,250,PETERMAN,"And so, I made an explosive out of chick peas, and I stopped that"
8,11,251,MORTY,"Well, it's getting kinda late, why don't we uh..."
8,11,251,ELAINE,"Mr Peterman, that can't have been the only time that you faced"
8,11,252,PETERMAN,"Ha ha ha. Funny you should ask, Elaine."
8,11,252,MORTY,"Look, if we're gonna stay here until all hours of the night, can we"
8,11,253,PETERMAN,"It's only five fifteen. So, later on that"
8,11,254,MORTY,"Okay, I'm done. I'll be back in the morning, when he's"
8,11,256,PETERMAN,Morty. My stories are what sell these clothes.
8,11,256,MORTY,"Cheap fabric, and dim lighting. That's how you move merchandise."
8,11,256,PETERMAN,"Morty, you're out."
8,11,256,MORTY,"Ach, I never knew what the hell I was peddling with"
8,11,271,KRAMER,I don't know why I let you talk me into that corned beef at
8,11,272,EMILY,No-one held a gun to your head.
8,11,272,KRAMER,Yeah.
8,11,272,EMILY,"Don't forget, we're eating dinner at the Feinerman's"
8,11,273,KRAMER,"Oh, why do I have to go? They're your friends."
8,11,273,EMILY,You like 'em.
