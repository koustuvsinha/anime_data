8,12,92,JERRY,"Hey, here you go. 'Hey, Reilly. The zoo called."
8,12,93,GEORGE,"No. No, no, no. You're not helping me."
8,12,93,KRAMER,"Look, just tell him you had sex with his wife. That'll kill him."
8,12,93,GEORGE,I'm not looking for another line. I got the line.
8,12,93,KRAMER,"Look, George, just think about it. You know, you're married, how"
8,12,94,GEORGE,"Alright, alright. You see? This is why I hate"
8,12,100,KRAMER,Did you take this out of the garbage?
8,12,100,JERRY,"Yeah, it's still got some spring in the strings."
8,12,100,KRAMER,"Oh, Jerry, this is a piece of junk. How"
8,12,102,KRAMER,You see? You can't let go.
8,12,102,JERRY,"Trust me, Kramer. Given the legal opportunity, I will kill you."
8,12,102,KRAMER,"I wish I could believe you. Hey, Elaine, do you have some free time"
8,12,103,ELAINE,Me?
8,12,103,KRAMER,"Yeah, because you're perfect. You're a calculating, cold-hearted"
8,12,105,ELAINE,"Oh, ho, c'mon."
8,12,109,SHELLBACH,"Situation number four. You're breathing on your own, you're"
8,12,110,KRAMER,"Well, would I be able to communicate?"
8,12,110,SHELLBACH,I don't see how.
8,12,110,ELAINE,"Ach, I don't like the sound of this one."
8,12,110,KRAMER,"Huhh, yeah, let's pull the cord."
8,12,110,ELAINE,Yank it like you're starting a mower.
8,12,110,SHELLBACH,"Moving on. You have liver, kidneys and gall bladder, but no"
8,12,112,KRAMER,"Well, I gotta have a central nervous system."
8,12,112,SHELLBACH,"Okay. One lung, blind and you're eating through a tube."
8,12,112,KRAMER,"Naw, that's not my style."
8,12,112,ELAINE,Bore-ing.
8,12,112,SHELLBACH,"Alright, you can eat. But machines do everything else."
8,12,112,KRAMER,Uhm...
8,12,113,ELAINE,I'd stick.
8,12,113,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah. Stick. 'Cos I could still go to the coffee"

8,12,134,ELAINE,"Oh, this is the one Vincent told me about. The Pain And The Yearning."
8,12,136,KRAMER,"That's a lotta yearning, huh?"
8,12,136,ELAINE,"You know, these movies are great, but they're just so emotionally"
8,12,137,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, what you need is some summertime adolescent high jinx."
8,12,137,ELAINE,Really?
8,12,137,KRAMER,"See what doctor Gene prescribes, huh? (pulls"

8,12,177,JERRY,Your husband?!
8,12,182,GEORGE,"So concerned was he, that word of his poor tennis skills might leak"
8,12,183,JERRY,He's new around here.
8,12,183,GEORGE,"So, details?"
8,12,183,JERRY,"Well, I didn't sleep with her."
8,12,183,GEORGE,"Because of society, right?"
8,12,183,JERRY,"Yes, George, because of society. So how did the big meeting"
8,12,185,GEORGE,Reilly is no longer with the club. You believe that?
8,12,186,JERRY,"Ah, you're better off. Now you can just let it go."
8,12,187,GEORGE,"Yeah, I'm gonna let it go."
8,12,187,JERRY,"You never really had the right comeback, anyway."

8,12,191,KRAMER,"Hey. Oh, Jerry, listen uh, you know, I saw the rest of that movie,"
8,12,192,GEORGE,"Ohh, I wanted to see that. (waves his arms in"
8,12,194,KRAMER,I didn't know it was possible to come out of a coma.
8,12,194,JERRY,I didn't know it was possible not to know that.
8,12,194,GEORGE,How was Eric Roberts as the husband?
8,12,194,KRAMER,"Oh, unforgettable."
8,12,194,GEORGE,Oww.

8,12,199,KRAMER,"Yeah, listen, uh, Elaine, I've changed my mind about the whole coma"
8,12,200,ELAINE,"Kramer, do you have any idea what you've done?"
8,12,201,MANAGER,Excuse me.
8,12,203,ELAINE,What're you doing?
8,12,204,ELAINE,Wha..wha...?
8,12,204,MANAGER,Vincent stopped making picks.
8,12,204,ELAINE,"Well, how am I gonna know what movies to see?"
8,12,204,MANAGER,We have a wide variety of Gene picks.
8,12,204,ELAINE,Gene's trash.

8,12,208,MILOS,"Thank you, but, unfortunately, I have much larger"
8,12,209,JERRY,I guess that's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade.
8,12,209,MILOS,"Patty, she, she loves tennis, as much like I do. Wou..would"
8,12,211,JERRY,"Well, I'll do it as long as there's no other girls around."
8,12,214,JERRY,So you hurt Vincent's feelings?
8,12,214,ELAINE,Look what came in the mail today.
8,12,214,JERRY,Wh..What's this?

8,12,218,JERRY,"You're flying to Akron, just to zing a guy?"
8,12,218,GEORGE,Don't you understand? It's not about him. To have a line as perfect
8,12,219,ELAINE,"See, there are no jerk stores. It..it's just a little confusing, is"
8,12,220,GEORGE,"It's smart. It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will"
8,12,224,GEORGE,Not you.
8,12,227,OLD WOMAN,"Oh, brittle bones. How I long to be rid of the pain."
