8,13,0,THE VAN BUREN BOYS,Written by Darin Henry
8,13,1,ELLEN,"So, they have this clock now, where you punch in your age, and all your risk factors. It actually counts down how much time you have left to live."
8,13,1,JERRY,"So what's the great moment? You're on your death bed, they're pounding on your chest - and you're going 10, 9, 8,.. I told you this thing was good!"
8,13,1,ELLEN,I can't believe this is our first date.
8,13,1,JERRY,I know.. How about dessert?
8,13,1,ELLEN,I suppose I have to get a piece of cake..
8,13,1,JERRY,Why?
8,13,1,ELLEN,Today's my birthday.
8,13,1,JERRY,What? Today? Really?
8,13,1,ELLEN,Yeah.
8,13,3,GEORGE,"So, she went out with you on a first date.. and it was her birthday?"
8,13,3,JERRY,Yeah. And she picked the day!
8,13,3,GEORGE,Is she socially awkward?
8,13,3,JERRY,"No, she's great! She's.. attractive, she's fun.."
8,13,3,GEORGE,"Well, maybe she decided to celebrate her birthday on the Monday after the weekend."
8,13,3,JERRY,She's not Lincoln.
8,13,4,KRAMER,Hey! Anybody up for Lorenzo's pizza?
8,13,4,JERRY,I'll pass.
8,13,4,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah? Huh. Hey, George! Pizza? Yum, yum!"
8,13,4,GEORGE,"Eh, I can't. I gotta go down to the foundation. I'm interviewing high schoolers for the Susan Ross.. scholarship."
8,13,4,JERRY,Does it ever bother you that this organization-
8,13,4,GEORGE,Nope!
8,13,4,JERRY,is beating the bushes-
8,13,4,GEORGE,Nope!
8,13,4,JERRY,to basically give this money away-
8,13,4,GEORGE,Noo!
8,13,4,JERRY,"to virtually anyone, as long as they're not you?"
8,13,4,GEORGE,I'm fine with it! Fi-hi-hi-hine I say!
8,13,5,STUDENT 1,And then I received a 740 on the English achievement test.
8,13,5,GEORGE,"Quick, what's your favorite animal?"
8,13,5,STUDENT 1,
8,13,5,GEORGE,A frog?
8,13,5,STUDENT 1,"Well, I.. I.."
8,13,5,GEORGE,Frog is wrong.
8,13,6,GEORGE,"I see here that you play the harp.. tell me, why do you have to tilt it? Can't you just build it on an angle? It'd save you a lot of trouble."
8,13,6,STUDENT 2,"Well, the modern-day harp has been refined over thousands of years-"
8,13,6,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. We'll, uh, let you know."
8,13,7,GEORGE,I see your G.P.A's a 4.0.
8,13,7,STUDENT 3,"You like that, don't you?"
8,13,8,GEORGE,"so, uh, Steven.. I see you're president of the chess club."
8,13,8,STEVEN,State champs.
8,13,8,GEORGE,Who's your favorite chess player?
8,13,8,STEVEN,Nastercoff?
8,13,8,GEORGE,"Right. Nastercoff.. What country is he from, again?"
8,13,8,STEVEN,I don't know.. I made it up. I'm never gonna get this thing.
8,13,8,GEORGE,"Woah, woah, woah! What are you telling me for? You really had me going, there! C'mon, sit down."
8,13,9,STEVEN,I've been telling people that I'd like to be an architect..
8,13,11,ELAINE,"So, get this: Mister Peterman is finally letting me do some real writing. He's got this book deal, for his autobiography. He's gonna let me ghost write it."
8,13,11,JERRY,"Wow. That's great! When it comes out, I'll have to get someone to ghost read it."
8,13,12,KRAMER,Hey.
8,13,12,JERRY,Hey.
8,13,12,ELAINE,Hey!
8,13,12,KRAMER,"Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's - loading up my slice of the fixin's bar.. garlic, and what-not.. mmm,"
8,13,14,JERRY,The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President Martin Van Buren?
8,13,14,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make a move to the door, you know, they block it! So, I lunged for the bathroom."
8,13,15,ELAINE,What? What happened?
8,13,15,KRAMER,Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.. Yeah.. like this I'm only showing eight fingers.
8,13,15,JERRY,"Well, what does that mean?"
8,13,15,KRAMER,"That's their secret sign! See, Van Buren, he was teh eighth President.. They thought I was a former Van B. Boy!"
8,13,16,ELLEN,"Oh, Jerry, can you hold on a sec? I just want to check my messages.."
8,13,17,MELISSA,Ellen.
8,13,17,ELLEN,"Hey! You guys, I want you to meet Jerry."
8,13,17,MELISSA,"Ohh, we've heard a lot about you! It is so sweet of you to take her out."
8,13,17,KIM,"Yeah, you don't even know how much she needs this."
8,13,17,JERRY,She coming of a bad break-up?
8,13,17,KIM,No.
8,13,17,MELISSA,See ya!
8,13,18,JERRY,Any messages?
8,13,18,ELLEN,"Yeah, no one called."
8,13,19,JERRY,They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out with her.
8,13,19,GEORGE,"So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine."
8,13,19,JERRY,There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.
8,13,19,GEORGE,Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath?
8,13,19,JERRY,"No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!"
8,13,19,GEORGE,"Hey, I htink I may have found someone for the scholarship."
8,13,19,JERRY,Yeah?
8,13,19,GEORGE,"I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.. finally, this kid walks in - Steven Koren - a regular guy.. likes sports.. watches T.V.."
8,13,19,JERRY,Is he smart?
8,13,19,GEORGE,He knows how to read. And he also knows finishing an entire book doesn't prove anything. And get this: he's into architecture.
8,13,19,JERRY,Hey! Just like you pretend to be.
8,13,19,GEORGE,"Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry."
8,13,19,JERRY,I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!
8,13,20,ELAINE,"Mister Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place isn't quite what I imagined.."
8,13,20,PETERMAN,Ohhh.. It's just a place to flop.
8,13,20,ELAINE,"Well, what part of your life do you want to start with? Foreign"
8,13,21,PETERMAN,"Oh, Elaine, we've covered all of that in the catalogue ad nauseum. No, I would like this book to be about my day-to-day life."
8,13,21,ELAINE,Oh.
8,13,21,PETERMAN,Oh damn. They changed the cable stations again.. just when I finally memorized them.
8,13,21,ELAINE,"Well, Mister Peterman, do you want to, um.."
8,13,21,PETERMAN,
8,13,21,ELAINE,"get, um, started.."
8,13,21,PETERMAN,3.. I don't know what that is.. where's my damn preview channel?
8,13,21,ELAINE,"Well, I - I got ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book here."
8,13,21,PETERMAN,"well, I'm sure we'll come up with something. What do you say you and I order ourselves a pie? Do you like Lorenzo's?"
8,13,21,ELAINE,"You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the Van Buren Boys?"
8,13,21,PETERMAN,You don't say.
8,13,21,ELAINE,Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally flashed their secret gang sign.
8,13,21,PETERMAN,"Well, that's pretty exciting. Let's put that in the book."
8,13,21,ELAINE,"But, that didn't happen to you."
8,13,21,PETERMAN,"So, we pay off your friend, and it becomes a Peterman."
8,13,21,ELAINE,"No, I - I really don't think you can do that."
8,13,21,PETERMAN,"Ohh, damn. I forgot to buy plant food again.. I'll bet I got a coupon for it."
8,13,21,ELAINE,You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend.
8,13,23,JERRY,Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday?
8,13,23,ELLEN,"No, this is brand new. Do you like it?"
8,13,23,JERRY,"Actually, yeah. Wait a second! Is that the fork that fell on the floor?! Are you using the fork that fell on the floor?!"
8,13,23,ELLEN,"No, Jerry, the waitress game be another one."
8,13,23,JERRY,I guess that's all right.
8,13,23,ELLEN,"Is something wrong, Jerry?"
8,13,23,JERRY,"No, absolutely nothing. You're fantastic! Hey guys!"
8,13,23,GEORGE,Hey.
8,13,23,JERRY,"Kramer, George, this is Ellen."
8,13,25,GEORGE,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is Steven Koren. His G.P.A. is a solid 2.0! Right in that meaty part of the curve -"
8,13,26,WYCK,"George, the quailifications for this scholarship were suppose to be.. largely academic."
8,13,26,GEORGE,I'm sure we're all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized tests..
8,13,26,WYCK,These aren't standardized tests - these are his grades.
8,13,26,GEORGE,"Besides, Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He wants to be an architect."
8,13,26,WYCK,Is that right?
8,13,26,STEVEN,"Actually, maybe I could set my sights a little bit higher."
8,13,26,GEORGE,"Steven, nothing is higher than an architect."
8,13,26,STEVEN,"I think I'd really like to be a city planner. Why limit myself to just one building, when I can design a"
8,13,27,WYCK,"Well, that's a good point."
8,13,27,GEORGE,"No, it's not."
8,13,27,STEVEN,"Well, isn't an architect just an art school drop-out with a tilty desk, and a big ruler?"
8,13,27,GEORGE,It's called a T-square.
8,13,27,WYCK,"You know, the stupidest guy in my fraternity became an architect - after he flunked out of dental school! Contratulations,"
8,13,28,STEVEN,Thank you.
8,13,28,WYCK,Susan would be proud of what you're doing.
8,13,28,STEVEN,Thank you.
8,13,30,KRAMER,"And they made it their sign, because, Van Buren, our 8th President, was the man they most admired."
8,13,30,PETERMAN,"Kramer, my friend, that is one ripping good yarn.."
8,13,30,KRAMER,"You know, if you like that one, I got more.. what are you looking for? Romance? Comedy? Adventue? .. Erotica?"
8,13,30,ELAINE,"No, uh, Kramer. I don't think -"
8,13,30,PETERMAN,How much would you take for the whole lot?
8,13,30,KRAMER,My whole lot?
8,13,30,PETERMAN,"Name your price, man!"
8,13,30,KRAMER,1500 dollars.
8,13,30,PETERMAN,I'll give you half that.
8,13,30,KRAMER,Done!
8,13,30,PETERMAN,"Kramer, my friend, consider Elaine at your disposal."
8,13,30,KRAMER,"Okay.. Well, I, Uh.. I like to work in the evenings.."
8,13,32,ELAINE,Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob Saccamano story?!
8,13,32,KRAMER,"Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So, I'm off to the store."
8,13,32,ELAINE,What happened to Bob Saccamano?
8,13,32,KRAMER,"Well, nothing. His part of the story is done. So I'm waiting for the"
8,13,33,ELAINE,"Alright, well, now that's something.."
8,13,33,KRAMER,"Well, I don't know if I lost track of time - or what, but the next think I knew.."
8,13,33,ELAINE,A train is bearing down on you?!
8,13,33,KRAMER,"No, I slipped - and fell in the mud. Ruining the very pants I was about to return."
8,13,33,ELAINE,I don't understand.. you were wearing the pants you were returning?
8,13,33,KRAMER,"Well, I guess I was.."
8,13,33,ELAINE,What were you gonna wear on the way back?
8,13,33,KRAMER,"Elaine, are you listening?! I didn't even get there! All right, next story.."
8,13,33,ELAINE,"Alright, I think I got enough for one day."
8,13,33,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, chew on that."
8,13,33,ELAINE,"Yeah, I'll chew on that."
8,13,33,KRAMER,"Oh, hey, listen, by the way - I'm hosting a little get-together tonight in honor of my little financial upturn.."
8,13,33,ELAINE,"Oh, thanks. I've got plans."
8,13,33,KRAMER,"Elaine, you should be there to document it."
8,13,33,ELAINE,"Oh, you're getting together with some of your jackass friends, and you want me to take notes?"
8,13,33,KRAMER,"Yeah, but get there after nine. You know, give the poeple a chance to loosen up."
8,13,35,JERRY,So you're denying him the scholarship just because he wants to be a city planner?
8,13,35,GEORGE,"I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if there's one person you should be able to hold down, it's your own flesh and blood. Like my"
8,13,36,JERRY,"You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field. Hello. Oh, Hi, Ellen. Yeah, I called the hotel.. we're all set for the weekend."
8,13,36,GEORGE,You're spending the weekend with Ellen?
8,13,36,JERRY,"Vermont! With any luck, they said we could stay an extra couple of days if we want to! (George is"
8,13,38,GEORGE,You want to start?
8,13,38,KRAMER,"Uh, No, no, no.. you go ahead. I gotta get my thoughts together."
8,13,38,GEORGE,"Jerry, this whole Ellen situation.. has gone far enough."
8,13,38,JERRY,What?!
8,13,38,KRAMER,"Jerry, she's a loser."
8,13,38,JERRY,Where is this coming from? She's great!
8,13,38,GEORGE,"Why're you doing this, Jerry? Is it your career? Things will pick up."
8,13,38,JERRY,There's nothing wrong with my career!
8,13,38,KRAMER,"Well, I still like the Bloomingdale's executive training program for him."
8,13,38,GEORGE,I though we said we weren't going to discuss that now!
8,13,38,KRAMER,"Well, you know, I think it's something he should consider."
8,13,38,GEORGE,"Of course he should consider it, but now is not the time!"
8,13,38,KRAMER,"Listen, George, all these issues are interrelated."
8,13,38,JERRY,Alright! Excuse me! I'm not buying any of this!
8,13,38,KRAMER,"All right, so what're you saying? That we're wrong? Oh, everybody's wrong but you!"
8,13,38,JERRY,"You know, this is liek that Twilight Zone where the guy wakes up, and he's the same - but everyone else is different!"
8,13,38,KRAMER,Which one?
8,13,38,JERRY,They were all like that!
8,13,40,STEVEN,"Why'd you take away my scholarship, Mister Costanza?"
8,13,40,GEORGE,"Well, Steven, I, uh.."
8,13,40,STEVEN,These are my new friends - The Van Buren Boys.
8,13,40,MEMBER 1,"He became so disillusioned, he had to join us."
8,13,40,GEORGE,Oh.. nice.
8,13,40,STEVEN,"I want my scholarship back, so I can be a city planner."
8,13,40,GEORGE,"What about architect, Steven?"
8,13,40,MEMBER 1,City planner.
8,13,42,FRIEND 1,"Great party, K-man!"
8,13,42,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, you got that straight! Hey, Elaine, try the beef - because that's realy au jus sauce, huh. Real au jus sauce!"
8,13,42,ELAINE,I'll make a note of it.
8,13,42,FRIEND 1,"Hey, Kramer,"
8,13,42,KRAMER,Yeah?
8,13,42,FRIEND 1,Ramirez has never heard your pants story.
8,13,42,KRAMER,"Ohh kay! Well, you know, I had Bob Saccamano on the phone, and I suddenly realized that I-"
8,13,42,ELAINE,You can't tell that story now. It belongs to Peterman.
8,13,42,KRAMER,What do ya mean?
8,13,42,ELAINE,You signed the release.
8,13,42,KRAMER,Yeah.
8,13,42,ELAINE,He sat in mud. Not you.
8,13,42,KRAMER,But I did sit in mud.
8,13,42,ELAINE,Ya didn't! You never sat in mud!
8,13,42,KRAMER,I was all dirty!
8,13,42,ELAINE,It ever happened! Understand?
8,13,43,KRAMER,"Hey, hey, hey! All right! Yeah, uh, yeah.. well.. Uh, the pants. they, uh, they fit, uh, well - and so I, uh, decided I wasn't gonna return them!"
8,13,45,FRIEND 1,It's getting late. Maybe we better get going.
8,13,45,KRAMER,"What? You're gonna go now? Hey, woah! I don't.."
8,13,46,KRAMER,"Kramer, Kramer! I got big trouble with the - with the Van Buren Boys."
8,13,46,KRAMER,"Hey, now, they're tough cookies."
8,13,46,GEORGE,"Yeah, and I - I heard you got on their good side. Now, what'd you do?"
8,13,46,KRAMER,"Uh.. ah, Oh, nothing - nothing.. No, I certainly don't have any stories, if that's"
8,13,47,GEORGE,"Kramer, do you know what those guys are gonna do to me?!"
8,13,47,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, uh.. you know uh, you didn't hear from me, but, uh, the Van Buren Boys - they never hassle their own kind."
8,13,47,GEORGE,"You mean, like, a former member?"
8,13,49,ELAINE,"These Kramer stories are unusable! I mean, some of them aren't even stories! Look, this is a list of things in his"
8,13,50,JERRY,Is my toaster oven on there?
8,13,50,ELAINE,How am I ever gonna turn this into a book?
8,13,50,JERRY,"Well, just shape them - change them. You're a writer."
8,13,50,ELAINE,Yes! I'm a writer.
8,13,50,JERRY,Make them interesting.
8,13,50,ELAINE,Interesting! Of course! People love interesting writing!
8,13,51,JERRY,"Well, I gotta go to the airport. I'm picking up my parents."
8,13,51,ELAINE,What? Wheren't they just here?
8,13,51,JERRY,Yeah. I'm flying them in to meet Ellen. I don't know where to turn! I gotta see what they think of her.
8,13,51,ELAINE,Maybe we could all have dinner later?
8,13,51,JERRY,I don't think so. I'm gonna try to get them to fly right back tonight.
8,13,52,KRAMER,"Oh, hey! Hey, have I told you about my bunions? Oh, you're gonna love this story! So, I line up my cold cuts on the couch"
8,13,53,JERRY,"Kramer, this is awful! We don't want to hear about this!"
8,13,53,KRAMER,Damn!
8,13,53,JERRY,What?
8,13,53,KRAMER,"Oh, I bought a bunch of bunion stories from Newman - but they all stink!"
8,13,53,ELAINE,How much did you pay for them?
8,13,53,KRAMER,Eight bucks! I think I got ripped off!
8,13,54,ELAINE,"Oh, what didn't you like about the first chapter?"
8,13,54,PETERMAN,"Well, it started out nicely: ""I'm returning some pants."" A very identifiable problem.. ""I set of down a train tunnel."".. But that's"
8,13,55,ELAINE,"Oh, no, no! That's where it gets interesting! Don't you see? The - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into a side tunnel - and you run into a"
8,13,56,PETERMAN,"It just seems so cliched, and obvious. It's not interesting writing."
8,13,56,ELAINE,"Yeah.. yeah. I know. Um.. how about if, instead of.. diving from the train, you.. uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall in some mud, and.. ruin your"
8,13,57,PETERMAN,"The very pants I was returning. That's perfect irony! Elaine, that is interesting writing!"
8,13,57,SECRETARY,I have a Cosmo Kramer on line 4.
8,13,57,PETERMAN,"Peterman, here."
8,13,57,KRAMER,"Mister Peterson, you gotta sell me my stories back!"
8,13,57,PETERMAN,You want to know something? I no longer need them!
8,13,57,ELAINE,"No, no. Mister Peterman, why don't we keep them - as a, as a reference?"
8,13,57,PETERMAN,"Nonsense! I have Benes' woderfully imaginative mind to spin my stories. You take back your tales, you vagabond!"
8,13,57,KRAMER,Yippie-yi-yay!
8,13,57,PETERMAN,"There you are, Elaine. Go forth, and create. And, by the way, when you get to that chapter about my romantic"
8,13,60,GEORGE,"Hey, Van B. Boys."
8,13,60,STEVEN,"So, Mister Costanza, did you get my scholarship back?"
8,13,60,GEORGE,"Now, fellas, fellas.. easy. You wouldn't want to beat up on one of your own."
8,13,60,MEMBER 2,Is that right? Then why don't you flash us the sign?
8,13,60,GEORGE,Right.. the sign.
8,13,60,STEVEN,That's not the sign.
8,13,60,GEORGE,It was when I was banging!
8,13,60,MEMBER 2,"All right, if you really are one of us.. let's see you take the wallet off the next guy who walks by."
8,13,60,GEORGE,Love to!
8,13,61,ELLEN,"And after college, I got my masters at the Sorbonne."
8,13,61,MORTY,"Sorbonne? Oh, hey. That's in Paris."
8,13,61,ELLEN,"Oh, Jerry, you're parking meter's about to expire. Don't get up, I've got change."
8,13,61,JERRY,So? What do you think?
8,13,61,HELEN,"Jerry, she's fantastic."
8,13,61,JERRY,I knew it! I'm not crazy.
8,13,61,HELEN,"She's so sweet, and she's got some body on her!"
8,13,61,MORTY,And smart! Like a computer!
8,13,61,HELEN,"And so much personality! But, it doesn't matter what we think. Do you like her?"
8,13,61,JERRY,"Now, I'm not so sure."
8,13,61,HELEN,"Well, she's 10 times better than that awful Amber girl that you were with."
8,13,61,JERRY,"yeah, Amber.. I wonder if she's back from Vegas.."
8,13,62,MEMBER 2,"The next one, or you're meat!"
8,13,62,GEORGE,"Alright, alright! Seinfelds!"
8,13,62,MORTY,"Hey, George!"
8,13,62,GEORGE,"Shhh! Listen, you gotta do me a favor. Give me your wallet. I'll give it back to you later."
8,13,62,MORTY,How're your folks?
8,13,62,GEORGE,"Eh, they're trying to pick out a new couch - you don't want to know. Give me your wallet, or I'll spill your"
8,13,63,MORTY,What did you say?
8,13,63,GEORGE,"Come on, hurry up, old man! I'm an animal!"
8,13,63,HELEN,"You're being very rude. Come on, Morty."
8,13,63,GEORGE,"Please, please, they're gonna hit me!"
8,13,63,MORTY,Tell your parents we said 'Hi!'
8,13,64,THE END,
