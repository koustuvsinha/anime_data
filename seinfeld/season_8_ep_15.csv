8,15,2,JERRY,Morning.
8,15,3,JENNA,Hope you don't mind baking soda flavour.
8,15,3,JERRY,"Ah, baking soda. Annoying little product. 'I"
8,15,4,JENNA,I'm gonna grab you a towel.
8,15,16,JERRY,Ooh-ooh
8,15,18,GEORGE,So?
8,15,18,JERRY,So? She used the toothbrush!
8,15,18,GEORGE,"You said you grabbed it outta there real fast, right?"
8,15,18,JERRY,Yeah.
8,15,18,GEORGE,"So I'm sure whatever germs it landed on were knocked out, and by the"
8,15,20,JERRY,How many years of med school did you have?
8,15,20,GEORGE,Was she mad?
8,15,21,GEORGE,You didn't tell her.
8,15,21,JERRY,Jenna's like me. She's very...
8,15,21,GEORGE,Finicky? Prissy? Fastidious?
8,15,21,JERRY,I'll take fastidious.
8,15,23,JERRY,What is that?
8,15,23,GEORGE,"Ahh, Steinbrenner gave 'em to us, in honour of Phil Rizzuto being"
8,15,25,HEAD,Holy cow!
8,15,25,JERRY,They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say 'holy
8,15,26,GEORGE,Just the last few innings of a double-header.
8,15,27,KRAMER,Hey. Look at this. I'm in the passing lane of the Arthur Berkhardt
8,15,30,JERRY,Why didn't you pull over?
8,15,30,KRAMER,Well I was draughting behind a semi. I didn't wanna lose him. The
8,15,32,HEAD,Holy cow!
8,15,32,KRAMER,"Well, look at that. A talking Nixon."
8,15,35,OWNER,China Panda.
8,15,35,ELAINE,"Yeah, I'd like to place an order."
8,15,35,OWNER,"Ah yes, what you like?"
8,15,35,ELAINE,"This Supreme Flounder, it says first time served in America. Is that"
8,15,36,OWNER,What number?
8,15,36,ELAINE,Forty-seven.
8,15,36,OWNER,"Yeah, first time. What else?"
8,15,36,ELAINE,"Uh, that's it."
8,15,36,OWNER,Address?
8,15,36,ELAINE,"Seventy-eight, West Eighty-sixth Street. Apartment three E."
8,15,36,OWNER,"That's southside. Sorry, we don't deliver below Eighty-sixth."
8,15,36,ELAINE,I'm not below.
8,15,36,OWNER,Yes you are. Street itself is boundary.
8,15,36,ELAINE,Your guy can't cross to my side?
8,15,36,OWNER,"If we deliver to you, then what? Eighty-fifth Street, Wall Street,"
8,15,37,ELAINE,"Alright, fine. I'll just cross and meet him."
8,15,37,OWNER,"Sorry, food only for those who live within boundary."
8,15,38,OWNER,China Panda.
8,15,38,ELAINE,"Uh, yeah yeah. I'd like to place an order."
8,15,38,OWNER,"Ah, what you like?"
8,15,40,KRAMER,"Well, I'm a poppa."
8,15,40,JERRY,Bring it on. Nothing's throwing me at this point.
8,15,40,KRAMER,"Well, as of today I am a proud parent of a"
8,15,41,JERRY,"Oh, that adopt-a-highway thing."
8,15,41,KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm part of the solution now Jerry. Yeah, I went down there and I"
8,15,44,JERRY,"Aw, looks just like you."
8,15,44,KRAMER,"Aw, I'm beaming Jerry."
8,15,44,JERRY,So what d'you have to do? Pay to keep it clean?
8,15,44,KRAMER,"They try to push you into using their cleaning crew, with all their"
8,15,45,JERRY,That old scam.
8,15,45,KRAMER,"Yeah, well that's why I'm doing it all myself. This parenting isn't"
8,15,46,JERRY,"At the side of the road, with a pile of garbage."
8,15,46,KRAMER,Quality time.
8,15,48,GEORGE,Keys. I can't find my keys.
8,15,48,JERRY,You lost Phil Rizzuto's head?!
8,15,48,GEORGE,Have you seen 'em?
8,15,48,JERRY,No.
8,15,48,GEORGE,Dammit!
8,15,48,KRAMER,"C'mon, retrace your steps. What d'you do today?"
8,15,48,GEORGE,"I got up, I was supposed to go to work, I came here instead."
8,15,48,KRAMER,Right.
8,15,48,JERRY,"Well, they're not here. You'll have to dig up your spare set."
8,15,48,GEORGE,I don't have a spare set. All my keys say 'do not duplicate'.
8,15,48,JERRY,So?
8,15,48,GEORGE,So you can't duplicate 'em.
8,15,49,KRAMER,Sure you can. Such a sweet kid.
8,15,54,ELAINE,"Oh. Oh, hi. China Panda?"
8,15,54,DELIVERY BOY,Why you waiting on the street and not in your
8,15,55,ELAINE,
8,15,56,DELIVERY BOY,You really live here?
8,15,56,ELAINE,"Oh yeah. There you go, keep the change. Bye now."
8,15,62,ELAINE,This isn't fair. This is address discrimination!
8,15,65,JERRY,"Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf."
8,15,65,GEORGE,So the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth?
8,15,66,JERRY,"By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it. Is"
8,15,67,GEORGE,"No, stings the throat. Anyway, so I was coming along here, and I felt"
8,15,76,GEORGE,"Now I remember, as I jumped over the hole I heard a, like a jingling"
8,15,77,JERRY,You didn't look down?
8,15,77,GEORGE,I was trying to stick the landing. ...was right around
8,15,80,GEORGE,No! No!!
8,15,81,HEAD,"Holy, Holy Cow!"
8,15,81,JERRY,Poor son of a bitch.
8,15,84,JERRY,It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second. It's the most powerful one
8,15,85,JENNA,It's like I'm holding a blender.
8,15,85,JERRY,The engine's made by McDonnell-Douglas.
8,15,86,JERRY,"Oh no, you keep going. It shuts off automatically."
8,15,86,JENNA,"Really, it does?"
8,15,86,JERRY,When the battery runs out.
8,15,86,JENNA,I was really happy with my old toothbrush.
8,15,88,JERRY,"No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. Don't forget to use"
8,15,90,JENNA,That stuff tastes like bleach!
8,15,91,JERRY,I don't know anything about that.
8,15,93,JENNA,Mmm. My mouth feels so clean.
8,15,93,JERRY,That's the idea.
8,15,98,JERRY,"You know, maybe we better not. I, I think I'm getting a little cold. I"
8,15,99,JENNA,"Aww. Okay. Thanks, I guess."
8,15,101,ELAINE,You still couldn't kiss her?
8,15,101,JERRY,"She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there."
8,15,101,ELAINE,"Oh, so now you're finding fault on a sub-atomic level."
8,15,101,JERRY,"Maybe if I could shrink myself down, like in Fantastic Voyage, and get"
8,15,103,ELAINE,"Jer, do you see where this is going?"
8,15,103,JERRY,Being really clean and happy?
8,15,103,ELAINE,"Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just"
8,15,105,JERRY,Disorder?
8,15,105,ELAINE,"And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full-on dementia."
8,15,105,JERRY,"Hmm, that could hurt me. Hey, there"
8,15,108,ELAINE,Shall we stop and say hi?
8,15,108,JERRY,"Nah, we've seen it."
8,15,108,ELAINE,Yeah.
8,15,113,KRAMER,"Hey Jerry! Yeah, I'll see you back at the house!"
8,15,114,KRAMER,"Mile one-fourteen, clean as a whistle."
8,15,124,MAN,Yeah?
8,15,124,ELAINE,"Hi. I'm your neighbour, uh, fr... from across the street. And uh,"
8,15,126,MAN,Wha? What d'you want?
8,15,126,ELAINE,"You see, there's this certain flounder and they won't deliver it to my"
8,15,127,MAN,"Wh, when is that?"
8,15,127,ELAINE,"No, I just need them to deliver it here and I have to be kinda inside is"
8,15,128,MAN,Who are you with?
8,15,128,ELAINE,"No, actually I'm... I'm just kind of hungry."
8,15,128,MAN,Who let you in?
8,15,128,ELAINE,"Well, the lock was broken. You just have to jiggle it, actually. But, I"
8,15,137,JERRY,What's with the signs?
8,15,137,KRAMER,"Hey, you should see the Berkhardt, Jerry. My mile is spotless. I mean"
8,15,139,JERRY,"Yeah, that stuff's all natural anyway."
8,15,139,KRAMER,"Speed limit, one hundred and sixty-five miles per"
8,15,142,JERRY,"Hey. So, keys?"
8,15,142,GEORGE,No keys. And I been calling the city all day. Course there's not really
8,15,143,JERRY,I guess they leave that up to the general population.
8,15,143,GEORGE,"I tell you this. If the real Phil Rizzuto was down there, this wouldn't"
8,15,144,JERRY,Hard to say.
8,15,144,KRAMER,"Hey, you need some roadwork done? 'Cos I met some maintenance guys today"
8,15,145,GEORGE,Really?
8,15,145,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, yeah. I borrowed some cones from them when I was sweeping my"
8,15,147,JERRY,Yeah?
8,15,147,JENNA,It's Jenna.
8,15,149,JERRY,"If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia."
8,15,150,GEORGE,You think you could hook me up with these guys?
8,15,150,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow. I'm gonna be at emergency"
8,15,151,GEORGE,Seven-eight-four.
8,15,152,JENNA,Hey.
8,15,152,JERRY,Hi.
8,15,152,JENNA,How you feeling?
8,15,152,JERRY,"Good. My cold's gone, and I've been looking forwards to kissing you,"
8,15,155,JENNA,What?!
8,15,155,JERRY,"Nothing. I just, I uh, I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray, and I"
8,15,158,JENNA,What?
8,15,158,JERRY,I'm sorry.
8,15,158,JENNA,When were you gonna tell me this?!
8,15,158,JERRY,Obviously never.
8,15,159,KRAMER,I need the yield sign.
8,15,160,JERRY,"Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Would you get these signs"
8,15,163,KRAMER,You could've introduced me.
8,15,163,JERRY,I wouldn't know where to start.
8,15,165,JERRY,"Hey, Jenna. Hey!"
8,15,166,JENNA,There. Now something of yours has been in the toilet.
8,15,166,JERRY,What?! Wha... what'd you put in there?
8,15,166,JENNA,Gotta run.
8,15,168,JERRY,"Oh, man!"
8,15,172,JERRY,"Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula?"
8,15,174,ELAINE,She won't even give you a hint?
8,15,174,JERRY,No. Could be anything. The whole apartment's a biohazard.
8,15,174,ELAINE,You know what I bet it is? Your remote.
8,15,174,JERRY,"Yes, that is a definite possibility."
8,15,175,ELAINE,"Or, could be your walkman there."
8,15,177,JERRY,Are you just screwing with me?
8,15,177,ELAINE,"Yeah, I am."
8,15,179,KRAMER,Hey ah.
8,15,179,JERRY,"Hey, how's life on the road?"
8,15,179,KRAMER,"Oh, I'm making a difference Jerry."
8,15,179,JERRY,I don't doubt it.
8,15,180,KRAMER,"You should see the smiles on the drivers' faces. I mean, you gotta look"
8,15,182,JERRY,What's this?
8,15,182,KRAMER,"Well, you know, those annoying little bumps on the lane-lines? (makes"
8,15,183,JERRY,Isn't that some kind of safety thing?
8,15,183,KRAMER,"Well, I had to pull 'em up if I'm gonna widen the lanes."
8,15,183,JERRY,What the hell are you talking about?
8,15,183,KRAMER,"Ah, you know how in planes they got first class? More leg room, better"
8,15,185,ELAINE,How are you gonna widen the lanes?
8,15,185,KRAMER,"Well you black out lane-lines one and three, and a four-lane highway"
8,15,186,JERRY,"Yeah, in my toolshed, next to the riding mower."
8,15,186,ELAINE,"Yuh, I'd like an order of supreme flounder, number"
8,15,187,JERRY,One-Q? Whose apartment is that?
8,15,187,ELAINE,"That's the janitor closet, across the street."
8,15,187,JERRY,"You're pretending to live in a janitor's closet, just to get this"
8,15,188,ELAINE,"It's better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser."
8,15,190,KRAMER,That stuff is unbelievable. I'd eat it out of a dumpster.
8,15,190,ELAINE,How do you know about it? You're not in the delivery
8,15,191,KRAMER,"Well, Newman uses his mail truck to run fish for China Panda on the"
8,15,192,ELAINE,"Well, mine's coming in ten, so... see you boys."
8,15,193,KRAMER,"Now, where's that tool shed of yours?"
8,15,199,ELAINE,"Hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you. I was in the shower."
8,15,201,ELAINE,I'll see you.
8,15,205,RALPH,You Costanza?
8,15,205,GEORGE,"Yeah. Thanks for, thanks for coming by fellas. Eh, got a set of keys,"
8,15,206,RALPH,What're the keys doing in there?
8,15,206,GEORGE,"Just need to uh, to dig 'em up."
8,15,206,RALPH,You put 'em in there?
8,15,206,GEORGE,"Nah, nah, it's uh, it's a long story. Just uh, try to get it up."
8,15,206,RALPH,Bad place to put your keys.
8,15,206,GEORGE,"Yeah, I know that. Could you start, working?"
8,15,206,RALPH,"Difficult job. You want those keys, we're gonna have to dig this up."
8,15,206,GEORGE,"Oh, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute. Is this"
8,15,207,RALPH,Yeah. It's about money.
8,15,218,MRS ALLISTER,"'Scuse me, what are you doing in there?"
8,15,218,ELAINE,"Uhm, nothing. I was just uhm... I wasn't in there."
8,15,218,MRS ALLISTER,"You were hanging around in there, lazing on the job. When you"
8,15,220,ELAINE,"Right, because... I'm the janitor."
8,15,220,MRS ALLISTER,Don't get smart with me.
8,15,220,ELAINE,Yes ma'am.
8,15,223,RADIO,"Hey, and if you're heading north on the Arthur Berkhardt, whoah Nelly,"
8,15,231,ELAINE,Oh it's you.
8,15,231,JERRY,Is the flounder here yet?
8,15,231,ELAINE,"No, it's not here yet. You want the tour?"
8,15,232,ELAINE,There's this.
8,15,232,JERRY,"Nice. French doors'd really open this place up. Oh, but you have a"
8,15,234,ELAINE,The fish!
8,15,235,ELAINE,"Ah, what're you doing here?"
8,15,235,GEORGE,Hey.
8,15,235,JERRY,Hey.
8,15,236,GEORGE,"Oh, I was uh, I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer, thought I'd"
8,15,237,JERRY,Kramer's guys?
8,15,237,GEORGE,Yeah. I got 'em down to fifty bucks. I just have to do all the
8,15,238,JERRY,"Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp."
8,15,240,GEORGE,Ow!
8,15,240,ELAINE,"Uh, man!"
8,15,241,KRAMER,"Huh, yeah. Oh, sweet setup. Elaine, d'you have any paint"

8,15,244,ELAINE,"Uh, Mrs Allister. Yeah, uh, just coming Mrs"
8,15,247,ELAINE,"Here, can you move, you gotta move from the door."
8,15,249,ELAINE,"Hi, I uhm... What can I do for you?"
8,15,249,MRS ALLISTER,I told you yesterday to haul that trash outta the basement.
8,15,249,ELAINE,"Yeah, I am so sorry."
8,15,249,MRS ALLISTER,Some of the children have been playing near it and putting it in
8,15,250,ELAINE,"Well, a lot of it is vegetable..."
8,15,252,MRS ALLISTER,"Get that stuff outta there today, or you'll be outta here."
8,15,253,ELAINE,Yes ma'am.
8,15,254,GEORGE,...stop pushing. Kramer spilled ammonia.
8,15,254,JERRY,I don't feel like eating.
8,15,254,KRAMER,"I'm gonna borrow this, huh?"
8,15,254,ELAINE,Janitor's meeting.
8,15,259,JENNA,"So Jerry, why'd you call me?"
8,15,259,JERRY,"Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness. I know"
8,15,260,JENNA,"Yes, I did."
8,15,260,JERRY,"Well, whatever. So, how've you been?"
8,15,260,JENNA,Good.

8,15,261,JERRY,Hi.
8,15,261,ELAINE,"Hi. Jerry, can I borrow your car?"
8,15,261,JERRY,For what?
8,15,261,ELAINE,I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump.
8,15,261,JERRY,"Dirt? That's alright, because there's nothing wrong"
8,15,262,ELAINE,"Well, actually it's pretty grimy."
8,15,262,JERRY,"Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze. Whatever it is, you take that stuff and"
8,15,264,ELAINE,"Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car."
8,15,264,JERRY,Sure. Bye.

8,15,281,JERRY,That's true.
8,15,281,JENNA,Mm.
8,15,281,JERRY,"But, I'll tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic"
8,15,292,JENNA,Do you hear something?
8,15,294,JERRY,I don't know what that could be.
8,15,299,HEAD,Holy cow!
8,15,305,JERRY,"Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty,"
8,15,313,JERRY,Holy cow! Have a nice life.
