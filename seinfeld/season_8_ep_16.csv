8,16,30,GEORGE,I look just like him. I. Me.
8,16,31,JERRY,Maybe he has money.
8,16,31,GEORGE,"Maybe he doesn't. Maybe he and I are exactly the same,"
8,16,32,JERRY,Sometimes you do.
8,16,32,GEORGE,Maybe it's some small thing I could change. Like a moustache. Or
8,16,33,JERRY,Who's she dating? Mr Peanut?
8,16,34,GEORGE,"She could do a lot worse than Mr Peanut, my friend."
8,16,37,BLAINE,"So, what d'you wanna see?"
8,16,37,ELAINE,What about Sack Lunch?
8,16,37,BLAINE,How about The English Patient? It's up
8,16,40,ELAINE,"Oh, c'mon Blaine. I mean, look at the poster for Sack Lunch."
8,16,40,BLAINE,It's a family in a brown paper bag.
8,16,40,ELAINE,Don't you wanna know how they got in there?
8,16,40,BLAINE,No.

8,16,42,BLAINE,"Oh, two for The English Patient."
8,16,43,ELAINE,"So d'you think they got shrunk down, or is it just a giant sack?"
8,16,46,GEORGE,"Uh, hi. Uhm, remember me? I..I'm the guy who looks like"

8,16,47,GEORGE,"Huh-Hi. Uhm, is Neil here?"
8,16,47,DANIELLE,"Oh, no. He got held up at work."
8,16,47,GEORGE,"Oh, that's too bad. I kinda wanted to meet him, seeing as how we look"
8,16,48,DANIELLE,"Well, you know, you don't look that much like him."
8,16,48,GEORGE,Oh. Course not.
8,16,48,DANIELLE,"No, you're a little taller."
8,16,49,DANIELLE,You look like you're in better shape than Neil. Do you work out?
8,16,49,GEORGE,"Listen, I..I..I don't mean to seem forward..."
8,16,51,GEORGE,...but is there any way that I could possibly have Neil's phone
8,16,55,ELAINE,"Why is everyone talking about ""The English"

8,16,58,GAIL,Didn't you love it?
8,16,58,LISA,How could you not love that movie?
8,16,58,ELAINE,"How about, it sucked?"
8,16,58,CAROL,"That Ralph Fiennes, I would give up my firstborn for him."
8,16,58,ELAINE,"Huhh, getting the short end of that stick."
8,16,62,MORTY,"Jerry, this is Del Boca Vista's new physical fitness room. They got"

8,16,73,SID,"Hey, Izzy, this kid says he can lift more than you can."
8,16,75,IZZY,"Your kid's pretty funny, Morty. Should be a comedian."
8,16,75,JERRY,"Actually, I am a comedian."
8,16,75,SID,That's not so funny.
8,16,75,IZZY,"Think you're better than me, huh?"
8,16,75,MORTY,Izzy used to work out with Charles Atlas in the fifties.
8,16,75,JERRY,Eighteen-fifties?
8,16,75,IZZY,"Yeah, that's it. It's go time."

8,16,92,ELAINE,"Hey, what're you guys doing here?"
8,16,92,LISA,We just saw The English Patient again.
8,16,92,GAIL,It's even better the second time.
8,16,92,ELAINE,They make it longer?
8,16,93,BLAINE,Got my umbrella.
8,16,93,ELAINE,Blaine!?
8,16,93,BLAINE,Elaine.
8,16,93,ELAINE,I thought you were busy tonight.
8,16,93,BLAINE,"Well, to tell you the truth Elaine. I don't know if I can be"
8,16,94,ELAINE,It's just a stupid movie.
8,16,94,BLAINE,That's what I'm talking about.
8,16,94,CAROL,"Come on, Blaine. Let's go."
8,16,94,BLAINE,Enjoy Sack Lunch!

8,16,107,GUILLERMO,What cigars?
8,16,107,JERRY,Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans.
8,16,107,GUILLERMO,We are the Cubans.
8,16,111,KRAMER,"Yeah, hello, Jerry's place."
8,16,113,JERRY,"They're real Cubans?! They're human beings, from Cuba?!"
8,16,113,KRAMER,I said Cubans. What'd you think I meant?
8,16,113,JERRY,Cigars!
8,16,113,KRAMER,"Jerry, Cuban cigars are illegal in this country. That's why I got"
8,16,114,JERRY,You're making your own cigars now?
8,16,114,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah. I got investors all lined up."
8,16,115,JERRY,Hold on a second. Hiya dad.
8,16,116,MORTY,Who are they?
8,16,116,JERRY,They're Cuban cigar rollers.
8,16,116,MORTY,Don't tell your mother.
8,16,117,JERRY,What is that bubbling sound? Are you making your tomato sauce?
8,16,117,KRAMER,Hot and spicy.
8,16,117,JERRY,"You're not wearing a shirt, are you?"
8,16,117,KRAMER,Yes I am.
8,16,117,JERRY,What colour is it?
8,16,118,KRAMER,Damn!
8,16,123,GEORGE,"You know, you could've just given me Neil's number. You..you didn't"
8,16,124,DANIELLE,I wanted to give it to you in person.
8,16,125,DANIELLE,"You know, I don't have to be up in the morning, and I"
8,16,127,GEORGE,Does Neil like to eat a big breakfast?
8,16,127,DANIELLE,Why don't you come in? We'll take about it.
8,16,127,GEORGE,"I really should get going. Y'know, I..I wanna"
8,16,128,DANIELLE,"Well, goodnight."
8,16,130,GEORGE,I'll see you.
8,16,133,WAITRESS,Rough night?
8,16,133,ELAINE,"Ugh. You wouldn't believe it. My boyfriend dumped me. My friends, who"
8,16,135,WAITRESS,Really? I thought it was pretty good.
8,16,135,ELAINE,"Oh, come on. Good? What was good about it? Those sex scenes!"
8,16,136,WAITRESS,"Well, I liked it."
8,16,137,ELAINE,Hey. You forgot about my piece of pie. Hello?
8,16,142,JERRY,This is quite a condo.
8,16,142,MORTY,The Mandelbaums own the Magic Pan restaurants.
8,16,142,JERRY,The crepe place?
8,16,142,MORTY,Yeah. This is all big crepe money.
8,16,142,JERRY,There's crepe money?
8,16,143,IZZY,What are you doing here?
8,16,143,JERRY,"Aw, Mr Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell you"
8,16,145,IZZY,What the hell is that?
8,16,145,JERRY,What?
8,16,145,IZZY,That shirt. You think that you are the number one dad?
8,16,145,MORTY,This was a gift from my son.
8,16,146,IZZY,"Oh, I see how it works now. He knocks me outta"
8,16,149,JERRY,"Mr Mandelbaum, please."
8,16,149,IZZY,It's go time.
8,16,151,IZZY,Ahh. My back. I can't move.
8,16,152,MORTY,Call an ambulance.
8,16,152,JERRY,I think I saw one a coupla doors down.
8,16,156,JERRY,"So she wanted you to come up, but you left because you"
8,16,158,GEORGE,Some guy. Some guy? Neil! I have got to find out how he
8,16,159,JERRY,"George, you've got Danielle. Forget about"
8,16,160,GEORGE,"So, I'm Neil? How did I do that?"
8,16,160,JERRY,"I don't know, but you better keep it up."
8,16,160,GEORGE,I'm gonna go meet Danielle. There's a new Neil in
8,16,162,JERRY,"I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole"
8,16,165,MORTY,Hey Jerry. Number One here. Did you go see Izzy at the back
8,16,166,JERRY,"I will, I just walked in the door."
8,16,166,HELEN,You have to go see him.
8,16,166,JERRY,Ma.
8,16,166,MORTY,"Helen, will you stop bothering him."
8,16,166,HELEN,"Jerry, that shirt is gone right to his head."
8,16,166,MORTY,"Number One, signing off."
8,16,167,KRAMER,"Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans at the bus station."
8,16,168,JERRY,What?
8,16,168,KRAMER,They're not real Cubans. They're Dominicans.
8,16,168,JERRY,So?
8,16,168,KRAMER,"So, Jerry, if my investors don't get Cubans, the whole deal's off."
8,16,168,JERRY,What's the difference?
8,16,168,KRAMER,"Jerry, once you've had real Cubans, there's just nothing else like"
8,16,169,JERRY,"We're talking about people, right?"
8,16,169,KRAMER,"Yes, yes. The quality, the texture, the intoxicating aroma. These"
8,16,170,JERRY,I thought they smelled pretty nice.
8,16,170,KRAMER,"Jerry, your palate's unrefined."
8,16,170,JERRY,Is not.
8,16,170,KRAMER,Is too.
8,16,170,JERRY,Is not.
8,16,170,KRAMER,Is too.
8,16,170,JERRY,I'm not having this conversation.

8,16,170,JERRY,Am not.
8,16,170,KRAMER,Are too.
8,16,173,PETERMAN,"Another productive meeting. By the way, I saw that English Patient"
8,16,174,DUGAN,Oh yes. It was so romantic. It ravished me.
8,16,175,PETERMAN,"Elaine, what'd you think?"
8,16,175,ELAINE,"Well, uh, act..actually, I haven't seen it. So, I couldn't"
8,16,176,PETERMAN,You haven't seen it?
8,16,176,ELAINE,No.
8,16,176,PETERMAN,That's it! Drop everything. We're going right now.
8,16,179,JERRY,"Again, Mr Mandelbaum, this back specialist is supposed to be the best."
8,16,182,IZZY,"Uh, oh, wait."
8,16,184,IZZY,"How 'bout that, huh? The World's Greatest Dad. My son made it for me."
8,16,184,JERRY,That's very nice.
8,16,184,IZZY,The best in the world. Which means I'm better
8,16,185,JERRY,"Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are."
8,16,187,IZZY,"Hi, son."
8,16,187,IZZY JR.,Hi daddy.
8,16,187,JERRY,This is your son?
8,16,187,IZZY,I got married in high school.
8,16,187,IZZY JR.,"Hey, who are you?"
8,16,187,IZZY,This is Seinfeld's kid.
8,16,187,IZZY JR.,"Oh, you think you're tough, picking on an old man? (squaring up to"
8,16,188,JERRY,You got any kids?
8,16,188,IZZY JR.,"Oh, you think you're better than me? Go ahead, pick"
8,16,189,JERRY,"Look, no-one is lifting anything."
8,16,189,IZZY,The television.
8,16,189,JERRY,Oh no.
8,16,190,IZZY JR.,"This one's for you, Pop. It's go time."
8,16,193,IZZY JR.,Ohh! My back!
8,16,193,IZZY,Call an ambulance.
8,16,193,JERRY,We're already in a hospital.
8,16,196,HAFFLER,"Awright, partner. Let's get down to business."
8,16,196,KRAMER,"Okay, well, uh, I'll uh, I'll get the Cubans."
8,16,197,KRAMER,They're right out here.
8,16,199,KRAMER,"Hey, here they are. The Cubans. Real Cubans."
8,16,200,HAFFLER,You wouldn't be trying to sell old Earl Haffler Dominicans in a
8,16,201,KRAMER,"Oh, now, come on. Look at these boys. If they were any more"
8,16,202,HAFFLER,"We're talking about people, right?"
8,16,202,KRAMER,I think so.
8,16,202,HAFFLER,I thought he quit smoking cigars.
8,16,202,KRAMER,"Well, yeah, yeah. But they also rolled for his brother... (thinks for"
8,16,203,HAFFLER,Dennis Castro?
8,16,203,KRAMER,"Uh, Dwayne."
8,16,203,HAFFLER,Get the hell outta my office.
8,16,203,KRAMER,What!?
8,16,205,DANIELLE,"You know, Neil called me today."
8,16,205,GEORGE,Really?
8,16,205,DANIELLE,Yeah. He's pretty upset that I broke up with him to go out with
8,16,206,GEORGE,"Ah, I guess I showed Neil who's Neil."
8,16,206,DANIELLE,He wants to get together tomorrow night and have coffee.
8,16,206,GEORGE,Coffee? I can beat that. Move in with me.
8,16,206,DANIELLE,What?
8,16,206,GEORGE,Beats the hell out of coffee.
8,16,212,PETERMAN,And I thought I knew what love was.
8,16,215,ELAINE,Yuh.
8,16,218,JERRY,You asked her to move in with you?
8,16,218,GEORGE,I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil.
8,16,218,JERRY,What if it's Neil Armstrong?
8,16,219,GEORGE,Then I'm going to Mars!
8,16,219,JERRY,What if it's Neil Diamond?
8,16,219,GEORGE,"Aw, shut up Jerry! Just shut up!"
8,16,219,JERRY,"Alright, I gotta go back to the hospital."
8,16,219,GEORGE,"What, to see the old guy?"
8,16,219,JERRY,"No, I got into a thing with the son, and now he's laid up too."
8,16,219,GEORGE,How old's the son?
8,16,219,JERRY,I think he's the same age as the father.
8,16,219,GEORGE,What is with this family?
8,16,219,JERRY,"I dunno. It's like, if one of 'em dies, the other one wants to bench"
8,16,223,KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry."
8,16,224,KRAMER,Datiditadit.
8,16,224,JERRY,You're cold?
8,16,224,KRAMER,No. Ditadidatidat.
8,16,224,JERRY,Something wrong with your chest?
8,16,224,KRAMER,Dijadidatjd. There.
8,16,224,JERRY,Where?
8,16,224,KRAMER,"No, no. Don't look. Don't look."
8,16,226,KRAMER,Over there. The Dominicans.
8,16,226,JERRY,Aren't they supposed to be rolling cigars?
8,16,226,KRAMER,"Well, it didn't quite work out, and now I've got nothing for them to"
8,16,227,GEORGE,So?
8,16,227,KRAMER,"So, I taught 'em all about Cuba, and they really took to it. You"
8,16,230,JERRY,"Boy, they seem pretty angry about something."
8,16,230,KRAMER,"Yeah. I'm a little worried. When there's no work, and the"
8,16,235,JERRY,"I swear to you, I didn't know they TV was bolted to the table."
8,16,235,IZZY JR.,"I bet you pulled that trick on my daddy, in Florida."
8,16,235,JERRY,He couldn't handle the weight.
8,16,235,IZZY,"Oh, so now you think you're better than me?"
8,16,235,IZZY JR.,You think you're better than him?!
8,16,235,JERRY,"Look, let me just state for the record, I think you're"
8,16,236,IZZY,Okay.

8,16,238,IZZY JR.,My grandpa.
8,16,238,JERRY,"Oh, come on!"
8,16,238,IZZY SR.,What happened to him?
8,16,238,JERRY,He was trying to lift the TV.
8,16,238,IZZY SR.,That TV?
8,16,239,JERRY,Oh no. It's go time.
8,16,240,IZZY IZZY SR..,Oohh!
8,16,242,IZZY SR.,Why didn't anybody tell me? It was bolted down!
8,16,242,IZZY,I still thought you could do it.
8,16,242,IZZY JR.,Me too.
8,16,243,JERRY,"Fellas, fellas, look, I gotta go."
8,16,243,IZZY,"Oh yeah, that's right. Go. Put us all in the hospital. And you've"
8,16,244,JERRY,I didn't ruin your business.
8,16,244,IZZY,"Yes, you did. There's nobody there now at the Magic Pan to roll the"
8,16,245,JERRY,Don't you hire people to do that?
8,16,245,IZZY,Each crepe has to be hand-rolled by a Mandelbaum. That's what puts the
8,16,246,JERRY,"So, you just need some guys that could roll 'em?"
