8,19,3,GLADYS,Be with you in a minute. (turns her back to Elaine and continues into
8,19,4,ELAINE,"Uhm, I just have a question."
8,19,4,GLADYS,"I know, the margaritas in that place are so strong."
8,19,4,ELAINE,Helloo? I'd like to buy these hirachis.
8,19,4,GLADYS,So? What else is goin' on?
8,19,4,GLADYS,"Listen, I'll call you back. Yes? What can I do for you?"
8,19,4,ELAINE,"Nothing. You, just lost a"
8,19,9,VALERIE,Ready to go? I don't wanna miss the previews.
8,19,9,JERRY,Me neither. I love the previews. In fact I enjoy being in the theatre cut
8,19,10,VALERIE,"I think that I was in that theatre. That, that was really funny."
8,19,10,JERRY,"Yeah, it got a good laugh. Let me just check my messages before we go."
8,19,15,GEORGE,So you're on the speed dial?
8,19,15,JERRY,After two dates!
8,19,15,GEORGE,What number?
8,19,15,JERRY,Seven.
8,19,15,GEORGE,"Wha! You know, it's a pain to change that. You gotta lift up that"
8,19,18,KRAMER,"Uh, hey buddy."
8,19,18,JERRY,Hey.
8,19,19,KRAMER,It all right if I keep these here for a while? I'm having a New Year's Eve
8,19,20,JERRY,You're gonna keep these here for eight months?!
8,19,21,KRAMER,"No, Jerry. New Year's Eve nineteen ninety-nine. The millennium. I told"
8,19,22,JERRY,"Kramer, you're gonna leave these chairs here for two and a half years?!"
8,19,22,KRAMER,You're not gonna see 'em. I got a case of party poppers I'm gonna keep
8,19,25,GEORGE,"Hey, so get this. I get a call this morning from one of the Mets front"
8,19,26,JERRY,What for?
8,19,26,GEORGE,"I'm on a winning ball club, Jerry. They probably wanna pick my"
8,19,27,JERRY,"Really, why d'you think they're taking you out to lunch?"
8,19,27,GEORGE,I have no idea.
8,19,28,ELAINE,"Alright, I have had it with those Mayans."
8,19,28,JERRY,I don't mind the Mayans.
8,19,29,ELAINE,"You know that store, Putumayo? I was trying to"
8,19,31,KRAMER,"What, we talking hirachis? I know a great store for hirachis."
8,19,31,ELAINE,"No, no, not Putumayo."
8,19,31,KRAMER,"No, no. Cinqo de Mayo. Yeah, Marcellino, he turned me on to"
8,19,32,GEORGE,"You know, I'm starting to get a little nervous about"
8,19,33,ELAINE,What'd you have?
8,19,35,KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm gonna keep these here too, huh? They'll be alright. (begins to"
8,19,36,JERRY,"Kramer, these balloons aren't gonna stay filled till New Year's!"
8,19,36,KRAMER,"Well, those aren't for New Year's. Those are my everyday"
8,19,39,MINKLER,"George, we'll be blunt. The Mets need somebody to head up scouting, and"
8,19,40,GEORGE,Head of scouting?
8,19,40,MOONEY,Interested?
8,19,40,GEORGE,I'm still here.
8,19,40,MINKLER,"Now, unfortunately, league rules prevent us from making you an offer"
8,19,41,MOONEY,You understand what we're talking about?
8,19,41,GEORGE,So you're talking...
8,19,41,MINKLER,"No, no."
8,19,41,MOONEY,"We're *not* talking. We're just, talking."
8,19,41,GEORGE,"So, you need me to get fired."
8,19,41,MINKLER,We didn't say that.
8,19,41,MOONEY,"We couldn't say that, because even if we did..."
8,19,41,MINKLER,...we couldn't say that we said it.
8,19,41,MOONEY,You see what we're saying?
8,19,41,GEORGE,You are still paying for this lunch?
8,19,41,MINKLER,We didn't say that.
8,19,44,JERRY,Hi. Sorry I'm late. There's a lotta chairs and balloons in my apartment.
8,19,45,VALERIE,Someplace nice this time?
8,19,45,JERRY,"Yeah, I'm sorry about that Mongolian barbecue last night. I'd heard good"
8,19,46,VALERIE,"I don't know, got a two in Zagat's."
8,19,47,JERRY,Lemme just check my messages. Maybe a nicer girl called.
8,19,48,VOICE,Hello?
8,19,48,JERRY,Hello? Who's this?
8,19,48,VOICE,Jane. What number did you dial?
8,19,50,JERRY,Seven?
8,19,53,ELAINE,Hey! See these? Cinqo
8,19,57,GEORGE,Meet the Mets...
8,19,58,GEORGE,...meet the Mets. Come on in and greet the Mets.
8,19,58,JERRY,Good meeting?
8,19,58,GEORGE,There was no meeting. But it was quite
8,19,60,JERRY,You can do that.
8,19,60,GEORGE,"Of course. But I really wanna leave my mark this time, you know, uh. I"
8,19,62,JERRY,So you want to go out in a final blaze of incompetence?
8,19,62,GEORGE,Ehh. Remember that summer at Dairy Queen where I cooled my
8,19,63,KRAMER,You think people will still be using napkins in the year two-thousand?
8,19,66,JERRY,"So, George..."
8,19,66,GEORGE,Yeah.
8,19,66,JERRY,"I had like a so-so date with Valerie, now I'm number nine on the"
8,19,68,GEORGE,So?
8,19,68,JERRY,So? I used to be seven. I dropped two spots.
8,19,68,GEORGE,"What, she's ranking you?"
8,19,68,JERRY,"Yeah, this speed-dial's like a relationship barometer."
8,19,68,GEORGE,What is a barometer exactly?
8,19,68,KRAMER,It's pronounced thermometer.
8,19,70,KRAMER,"You know, in the year two-thousand, we'll all be on speed-dial. You'll"
8,19,73,KRAMER,"Hey, it's Newman. Hey, how you"
8,19,76,KRAMER,"Oh, you wanna talk to Jerry?"
8,19,80,VALERIE,"Oh, flowers. You didn't have to do that. I mean, the dinner,"
8,19,81,JERRY,"Well, I just wanted to... You forgot the gift certificate to"
8,19,82,VALERIE,Oh.
8,19,82,JERRY,"...you know, make a good impression."
8,19,82,VALERIE,I'm gonna go put these in some water.
8,19,82,JERRY,I like the way you think.
8,19,85,JERRY,"Oh my God! Number one!! Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard!"
8,19,89,GEORGE,"Sorry I'm late, but look what I found in the Yankee Hall of Pride"
8,19,90,WILHELM,Isn't that Babe Ruth's uniform?
8,19,90,GEORGE,Is it?
8,19,91,GEORGE,"Huh, strawberries, anyone? Ah, that's good. Ooh,"
8,19,93,GEORGE,Gotta get the good ones.
8,19,95,GEORGE,"Oh, that's bad. That's bad."
8,19,97,KRAMER,"So Jerry, my millennium party's really coming together. Will people be"
8,19,98,JERRY,Some of us.
8,19,98,KRAMER,I don't wanna exclude anybody.
8,19,100,JERRY,Hola.
8,19,100,ELAINE,Shove it!
8,19,100,JERRY,What is all this?
8,19,100,ELAINE,"I got all this junk at Cinqo de Mayo, because I was trying to show"
8,19,102,JERRY,"Ah, no wonder we're getting so much rain."
8,19,102,KRAMER,"Elaine, I'm having a millennium party, so save the date."
8,19,102,ELAINE,"Hey, you know what? Newman sent me an invitation already, to his party."
8,19,103,KRAMER,Newman?
8,19,103,ELAINE,Yeah.
8,19,104,KRAMER,"Come celebrate the millennium, with Newmanniun. Newman!"
8,19,106,JERRY,Hi Valerie.
8,19,107,JERRY,You're not Valerie.
8,19,107,MRS HAMILTON,I'm her step-mother. Drive.
8,19,108,MRS HAMILTON,It's taken me thirteen years to climb up to the top of that
8,19,109,JERRY,"But, I never..."
8,19,109,MRS HAMILTON,You just stay away from that phone.
8,19,111,GEORGE,"You wanted to see me, sir?"
8,19,111,STEINBRENNER,I heard about what happened at the meeting this morning...
8,19,112,GEORGE,"Oh, yes. I already packed up my desk, sir. I can be outta here in an"
8,19,113,STEINBRENNER,"...and I have to tell you, it's exactly what this organisation"
8,19,115,STEINBRENNER,"We wanna look to the future, we gotta tear down the past. Babe"
8,19,123,STEINBRENNER,"Hey, how 'bout some lunch. What're you going for?"
8,19,125,JERRY,"You know uh, Valerie, I uh, couldn't help but notice that I'm on your"
8,19,126,VALERIE,You deserve it.
8,19,126,JERRY,But I can't help thinking that maybe there's someone in your life who
8,19,127,VALERIE,"My stepmother got to you, didn't she?"
8,19,127,JERRY,What? No.
8,19,127,VALERIE,"Uuh, I can't believe she did this again. That's it! She's off the"
8,19,129,JERRY,Yikes!
8,19,131,KRAMER,"Well, I just got your invitation to the Newmanniun party."
8,19,131,NEWMAN,"You just got it? Damn, the mail is slow."
8,19,131,KRAMER,"You knew I was having a millennium party, but you"
8,19,132,NEWMAN,I have done nothing unethical.
8,19,132,KRAMER,"Yeah, well you're gonna have to cancel it, because I've told everybody"
8,19,133,NEWMAN,"Cancel! Think again, longshanks! I started planning this"
8,19,135,KRAMER,"Well, what am I gonna do? I got over two hundred folding"
8,19,136,NEWMAN,What kind?
8,19,136,KRAMER,Cubed.
8,19,136,NEWMAN,"That's good stuff, and you can never have too much ice. Alright, I'll"
8,19,138,KRAMER,I gotta invite Jerry. He's my buddy.
8,19,138,NEWMAN,"That he may be. But he's outta my life, starting in the year"
8,19,141,JERRY,How could they not fire you?
8,19,141,GEORGE,Never thought I'd fail at failing.
8,19,141,JERRY,"Aw, come on there now."
8,19,141,GEORGE,Feel like I can't do anything wrong.
8,19,141,JERRY,Nonsense. You do everything wrong.
8,19,141,GEORGE,Everything?
8,19,141,JERRY,Everything.
8,19,141,GEORGE,You really think so?
8,19,141,JERRY,Absolutely. I have no confidence in you.
8,19,141,GEORGE,"Alright. I guess I just have to pick myself up, dust myself off, and"
8,19,142,JERRY,That's the spirit. You suck!
8,19,142,GEORGE,I know.
8,19,144,ELAINE,"No, no, no no, listen to me. I work in fashion. Together, we can drive"
8,19,146,GLADYS,Do you need some help with something?
8,19,146,ELAINE,You? What're you doing here?
8,19,146,GLADYS,I own this store.
8,19,146,ELAINE,No you don't. You own Putumayo. Unless you own both stores. (laughs
8,19,147,GLADYS,I'm Gladys Mayo.
8,19,148,ELAINE,"Ah, this really sticks in my craw."
8,19,151,JERRY,"Well, Mrs Hamilton, it's certainly nice that you and Valerie patched"
8,19,152,MRS HAMILTON,"I'm sure she'll be along. Have some wine,"
8,19,153,JERRY,Okay.
8,19,157,MRS HAMILTON,"You know Jerome, I can understand what Valerie sees in you. So"
8,19,158,JERRY,"Uh, good."
8,19,158,MRS HAMILTON,"Jerome, I have a deliciously naughty idea."
8,19,158,JERRY,What?
8,19,158,MRS HAMILTON,Why don't I put you on my speed-dial?
8,19,158,JERRY,"I don't know, Mrs Hamilton. That doesn't sound..."
8,19,158,MRS HAMILTON,"Don't be such a child, Jerome. How's number three sound?"
8,19,159,JERRY,"Valerie's not coming over, is she?"
8,19,160,MRS HAMILTON,"Seven, four..."
8,19,160,JERRY,No...
8,19,160,MRS HAMILTON,Two...
8,19,160,JERRY,"Stop, stop. This isn't right. What about Valerie?"
8,19,160,MRS HAMILTON,I won't tell if you don't.
8,19,160,JERRY,Wuhh...
8,19,162,KRAMER,Jerry... Newman... Two-thousand...
8,19,163,KRAMER,Newmanniun!!
8,19,165,KRAMER,Jerry?
8,19,168,KOREN,"Alright, Yankees, two. Orioles, nothing. Wait a minute! A short"
8,19,169,JERRY,"Oh my God, George!"
8,19,169,KOREN,Check that. He's not streaking. He's wearing a flesh-tone
8,19,171,JERRY,"Kramer, look, it's George."
8,19,171,KOREN,Everyone loves him.
8,19,171,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, I know. Listen, Jerry, I can't let"
8,19,172,JERRY,Fine.
8,19,172,KRAMER,"I mean, it's killing me! Newman's got the jump on the"
8,19,173,JERRY,No problem.
8,19,173,KRAMER,You're right. I won't do it without you. I
8,19,175,KRAMER,"Elaine, you can't go to Newman's Newmanniun."
8,19,175,ELAINE,Okay.
8,19,175,KRAMER,"No, no, no. You gotta spend New Year's nineteen ninety-nine with me and"
8,19,176,ELAINE,Fine.
8,19,176,KRAMER,Oh come on!!
8,19,176,ELAINE,Alright.
8,19,176,KRAMER,"Yesss! Alright, so it's you, it's me, and it's Jerry, huh."
8,19,179,ELAINE,"Okay. Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute. Do"
8,19,180,KRAMER,Yeah.
8,19,180,ELAINE,"Okay, I need you to help me put Putumayo outta business."
8,19,180,KRAMER,Can do.
8,19,181,JERRY,What're you doing with a pricing-gun?
8,19,181,ELAINE,That place is about to have the sale of the century. Nothing over
8,19,183,JERRY,Still a rip-off.
8,19,184,JERRY,Hello?
8,19,187,VALERIE,"Jerry, I was just at my stepmom's house, and I saw that you were on her"
8,19,188,JERRY,"Uh, well, she uh, probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you."
8,19,189,JERRY,Hold on a second.
8,19,190,JERRY,Hello?
8,19,190,MRS HAMILTON,Hi Jerome.
8,19,190,JERRY,"Oh, Mrs Hamilton, this is a very bad time. I've got Valerie on the other"
8,19,192,JERRY,Hello?
8,19,192,VALERIE,"That's her on the other line, isn't it?"
8,19,192,JERRY,Well...
8,19,192,VALERIE,Tell her I don't want you on her speed-dial.
8,19,192,JERRY,Hang on.
8,19,193,JERRY,"She knows about the speed-dial. Mrs Hamilton, you gotta get me off this"
8,19,194,MRS HAMILTON,"I won't, until she puts me back on hers."
8,19,194,JERRY,Hang on.
8,19,195,JERRY,She wants to be back on yours.
8,19,195,VALERIE,Fine. But only if you're off hers.
8,19,195,JERRY,Hang on.
8,19,196,JERRY,"Fine, if I'm off yours."
8,19,196,VALERIE,"No, still me."
8,19,196,JERRY,Sorry. Hang on.
8,19,197,JERRY,"Fine, if I'm off yours."
8,19,197,MRS HAMILTON,"I won't do it. It's my speed-dial, and I don't trust her."
8,19,197,JERRY,"Please, Mrs Hamilton, this is very awkward for me."
8,19,197,MRS HAMILTON,Alright. I'll hide you in one of the emergency
8,19,198,JERRY,"Great, bye."
8,19,199,JERRY,She said she'll do it.
8,19,199,VALERIE,Great.
8,19,200,JERRY,Hang on.
8,19,201,JERRY,Hello?
8,19,204,GEORGE,Jerry. I can't get fired.
8,19,205,FAN,"Hey, body-suit man. 's up?"
8,19,207,FAN,"Hey, body-suit man."
8,19,213,KRAMER,"Hi, I'm H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy American industrialist uh,"
8,19,218,GLADYS,"Well, lemme show you what we have."
8,19,218,KRAMER,"Well uh, I think I can just browse around on my own."
8,19,218,KRAMER,"Hmm, Macchu Picchu. Are these free?"
8,19,218,GLADYS,Yeah.
8,19,218,KRAMER,Hmm-mmm.
8,19,220,GLADYS,Some of those are women's clothes.
8,19,220,KRAMER,"Oh, not a problem."
8,19,228,GEORGE,Attention Steinbrenner and front-office morons! Your triumphs mean
8,19,234,KRAMER,L'Occupado.
8,19,234,ELAINE,"Come on, what is taking you so long?"
8,19,234,KRAMER,"Elaine, I broke the price-gun, so I had to move to plan B."
8,19,234,ELAINE,Plan B? There is no plan B.
8,19,234,KRAMER,I took these out of every single
8,19,235,ELAINE,What?!
8,19,235,KRAMER,"They're dessicates. See, they absorb moisture. These clothes"
8,19,236,ELAINE,That's not gonna do anything.
8,19,236,KRAMER,Patience.
8,19,236,ELAINE,Alright. Forget it!
8,19,236,KRAMER,What?
8,19,236,ELAINE,"You have screwed me again, Pennypacker!"
8,19,237,GLADYS,"Ladies, care for some chips?"
8,19,237,KRAMER,"Well, I don't mind if I do."
8,19,240,KRAMER,"Well, I've uh, I've changed my mind. I think I'm going to build a"
8,19,246,STEINBRENNER,"I heard what you did in the parking lot, big boy, and it is"
8,19,251,WILHELM,"Wait, wait, Mr Steinbrenner. George doesn't deserve any of the blame"
8,19,254,STEINBRENNER,"What're you talking about, Wilhelm. You popping pills? You got the"
8,19,255,WILHELM,"No, no. No, no, sir. I ordered George to drive around insulting people"
8,19,256,GEORGE,"He's lying, sir! I'm tired of all your macho head games!"
8,19,256,STEINBRENNER,Macho head games?
8,19,256,WILHELM,"He's just being loyal to me, sir."
8,19,256,STEINBRENNER,"Wilhelm, you're fired. I owe you an apology, body-suit man. Streak"
8,19,259,GEORGE,"Mr Wilhelm, what was that?!"
8,19,259,WILHELM,"I wanted to get fired. George, you are looking at the new head scout of"
8,19,261,WILHELM,"Meet the Mets, meet the Mets. Come right out and greet the"
8,19,263,KRAMER,"I don't know what Elaine is so upset about. I mean, without dessicates,"
8,19,264,JERRY,She never sees the big picture.
8,19,265,JERRY,"Hello, Newman!"
8,19,265,NEWMAN,Hello Jerry. What did you say to Elaine? I just got her
8,19,266,KRAMER,"Oh, well I guess she found some place better to go."
8,19,266,NEWMAN,"Well, it's her mistake. Because she is going to miss the party of a"
8,19,267,KRAMER,"Well, maybe so, but come midnight, when she's looking for someone warm"
8,19,268,NEWMAN,"Alright. Come back to my party, please."
8,19,268,KRAMER,"Jerry too, of course."
8,19,268,NEWMAN,"You don't wanna do your... act, or anything, do you?"
8,19,268,JERRY,No.
8,19,268,NEWMAN,"Alright then, I guess I can accept a little Jerry, if it gets me a"
8,19,270,KRAMER,Deal?
8,19,270,NEWMAN,To the Newmanniun!
8,19,270,KRAMER,To the Kramennium.
8,19,272,JERRY,"By the way Newman, I'm just curious. When you booked the hotel, did you"
8,19,273,NEWMAN,"As a matter of fact, I did."
8,19,273,JERRY,"Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone knows, since there was no"
8,19,277,JERRY,Aww!
8,19,281,MRS HAMILTON,I don't feel well at all. I feel all dried-out inside.
8,19,281,VALERIE,I'll call for help.
8,19,283,JERRY,Hello?
8,19,283,VALERIE,Who's this?
8,19,283,JERRY,It's Jerry. Who's this?
8,19,283,VALERIE,"Uh, it's Valerie."
8,19,283,JERRY,"Oh, hi Valerie. What's up?"
8,19,283,VALERIE,"I'll tell you what's up. My stepmother is violently ill, so I hit the"
8,19,284,JERRY,"Wow, poison control? That's even higher than number one!"
8,19,285,JERRY,Hello?
8,19,285,THE END,
