8,2,0,THE BIZARRO JERRY,Written by David Mandel
8,2,1,JERRY,All right. How 'bout this one: let's say you're abducted by aliens.
8,2,1,GEORGE,Fine.
8,2,1,JERRY,"They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?"
8,2,1,GEORGE,I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.
8,2,1,JERRY,"But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!"
8,2,1,GEORGE,"I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth.."
8,2,1,JERRY,At least it's show business..
8,2,1,GEORGE,"But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate."
8,2,1,JERRY,What if she's got no interest in you?
8,2,1,GEORGE,W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.
8,2,1,(TIME: 00:43),
8,2,3,KRAMER,"George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?"
8,2,3,GEORGE,"Krama, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!"
8,2,3,KRAMER,Wha??
8,2,3,JERRY,He knows.
8,2,3,GEORGE,"{Anyway,} on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! Ha ha!"
8,2,3,KRAMER,"Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later."
8,2,3,GEORGE,You sure?
8,2,3,JERRY,He knows.
8,2,5,GEORGE,Wow.

8,2,14,GEORGE,Hnn! Let me see that.
8,2,14,JERRY,"So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel-toe his ass back to Kentucky?"
8,2,14,ELAINE,You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really
8,2,15,JERRY,Why would anybody want a friend.
8,2,15,ELAINE,Uh.
8,2,17,JERRY,I mean all that stuff is so small..
8,2,19,GEORGE,"You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiancée.."
8,2,19,JERRY,What?
8,2,19,GEORGE,"Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been"

8,2,29,ELAINE,"Man, Hands?"
8,2,29,JERRY,"The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast."
8,2,29,ELAINE,"{Look,} would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?"
8,2,29,JERRY,Would she have hooks?
8,2,29,ELAINE,"Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?"
