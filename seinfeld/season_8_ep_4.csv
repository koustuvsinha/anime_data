8,4,2,ELAINE,Difficult ?
8,4,2,DOCTOR,Elaine. You shouldn't be reading that. So tell me about this rash of yours.
8,4,2,ELAINE,"Well it's , it's..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse asked me to put a gown on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know they're made of paper."
8,4,2,DOCTOR,Well that was a long time ago. How about if I just erase it. Now about that rash...
8,4,2,ELAINE,But it was in pen. You fake erase.
8,4,2,DOCTOR,All right Miss Benes. This doesn't look too serious. You'll be fine.
8,4,2,ELAINE,What are you writing? Doctor.
8,4,3,SHEILA,Here you go.
8,4,3,GEORGE,Thanks.
8,4,3,SHEILA,I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt.

8,4,6,GEORGE,Don't you see. She's looking at my pictures.
8,4,6,JERRY,Why did you take a picture of a mustard stain ?
8,4,6,GEORGE,That's got nothing to do with it.
8,4,6,JERRY,I see. She's looking.
8,4,6,GEORGE,Yesssss.
8,4,6,KRAMER,"Hey , you got to get this thing fixed"

8,4,8,ELAINE,"No , no. I was looking at my chart and it said I was difficult. Why"
8,4,9,JERRY,They have gotten to know you.
8,4,10,ELAINE,Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my
8,4,11,GEORGE,Why don't you find a doctor that doesn't know your difficult.
8,4,11,ELAINE,Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy.
8,4,11,JERRY,Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys.
8,4,11,ELAINE,Listen to me you little shi........
8,4,11,GEORGE,Smile.
8,4,12,DOCTOR,Well Elaine you really didn't have to put on the gown.
8,4,12,ELAINE,Oh it's my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home. It's
8,4,14,DOCTOR,All rightly. Let me just review your history before we begin.
8,4,14,ELAINE,Where did you get my chart ?

8,4,20,GEORGE,What do you think it's a bomb ?
8,4,20,JERRY,It's not totally impossible.

8,4,85,ATTENDANT,Really ?
8,4,85,KRAMER,The Netherlands ?
8,4,85,ELAINE,Where's my chart ? Did you get it ?
8,4,85,KRAMER,No.
8,4,85,ELAINE,What ? What happened ?
8,4,85,KRAMER,I don't know. But now they got a chart on me.
8,4,86,SHEILA,I don't know where they could be.
8,4,86,GEORGE,Can't find them. That's marvelous. The dance continues.
8,4,86,SHEILA,Well if I find them I'll call you.
8,4,86,GEORGE,And maybe we could go out and do something
8,4,86,SHEILA,Sure.
8,4,86,RON,Hello.
8,4,86,GEORGE,Hi.
8,4,87,SHEILA,So the little guy finally asked me out
8,4,87,RON,Really ?
8,4,87,SHEILA,Hey I can't find his photo's anywhere
8,4,87,RON,Oh you know what happened. Some guy from the Post Office confiscated
8,4,88,SHEILA,Newman ?
8,4,89,GEORGE,I don't know what Newman wanted to see me for.
8,4,91,JERRY,I'm clean and you know it.
8,4,91,NEWMAN,Clean ? Hardly. This looks like a man that isn't happy with his
8,4,92,JERRY,Where did you get that ?
8,4,92,GEORGE,I think that's one of mine.
8,4,92,NEWMAN,It looks like your breaking into it like an otter breaking into a clam.
8,4,92,JERRY,I don't know about that but I'm sure there is a explanation.
8,4,92,NEWMAN,Yes. It's called mail fraud. Oohhhh . How I've longed for this
8,4,95,NEWMAN,There will be a small fine.
8,4,95,JERRY,Okay.
8,4,95,GEORGE,Can we go now ?
8,4,95,NEWMAN,Not so fast pretty boy. There is more to this sorted little affair.
8,4,95,JERRY,Oh my god !!
8,4,95,NEWMAN,This photo clearly indicates your involvement in some ill-conceived mail order pornography ring. As does this one found in the same disturbing packet.
8,4,96,NEWMAN,We have some questions we'd like you to answer.
8,4,96,JERRY,I have some questions of my own.
8,4,97,SHEILA,"Hi. One of your mailmen....... Oh my god , George !?!"
8,4,97,GEORGE,Listen Sheila it's not what you think . I put my trust into the wrong
8,4,98,JERRY,The timeless art of seduction.
