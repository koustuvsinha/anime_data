8,5,1,WOMAN,"Well I started out working in mortgage bonds, but I just found that so"
8,5,2,JERRY,My friend Kramer and I were discussing that same thing the other day.
8,5,3,WOMAN,"Wow. Well then my mentor suggested that I move into equities, best move"
8,5,4,JERRY,Mentor? You mean your boss.
8,5,4,WOMAN,"Oh, no no no, Cynthia's just a successful businesswoman who's taken me"
8,5,5,JERRY,Hmm. So Cynthia's your mentor.
8,5,5,WOMAN,"And I'm her protégé. You must have someone like that. You know, who"
8,5,6,JERRY,"Well, I like Gabe Kaplan."
8,5,7,GEORGE,I still don't understand this. Abby has a mentor?
8,5,7,JERRY,Yes. And the mentor advises the protégé.
8,5,7,GEORGE,Is there any money involved?
8,5,7,JERRY,No.
8,5,7,GEORGE,So what's in it for the mentor?
8,5,7,JERRY,"Respect, admiration, prestige."
8,5,7,GEORGE,Pssh. Would the protégé pick up stuff for the mentor?
8,5,7,JERRY,"I suppose if it was on the protégé's way to the mentor, they might."
8,5,7,GEORGE,Laundry? Dry cleaning?
8,5,7,JERRY,"It's not a valet, it's a protégé."
8,5,7,GEORGE,"Alright. Listen, I gotta get some reading done. You mind if I do this"
8,5,8,JERRY,Risk management?
8,5,8,GEORGE,Yeah. Steinbrenner wants everyone in the front office to give a
8,5,9,JERRY,Well what makes them think you're a risk management expert?
8,5,9,GEORGE,I guess it's on my resume.
8,5,10,JERRY,Hello?
8,5,10,VOICE,Please hold for Elaine Benes.
8,5,10,GEORGE,You know what? I can't do this. I can't read books anymore; books on
8,5,12,JERRY,So get this book on tape.
8,5,12,GEORGE,"You can't, it's a textbook."
8,5,12,ELAINE,"Hey, Jer. Are you going to this Bob Sacamano party?"
8,5,12,JERRY,Am I going? It was three nights ago.
8,5,12,ELAINE,"What? You're kidding, I just got this invitation today. Oh, I was so"
8,5,13,JERRY,"Oh, it was a lovely affair."
8,5,13,ELAINE,"Wait a minute; this postmark is three weeks old. Man, this happens all"
8,5,14,JEANINE,Eddie Sherman.
8,5,14,ELAINE,"Alright, send him up here."
8,5,14,JERRY,You gonna do a little yelling?
8,5,14,ELAINE,I'm gonna do a little firing.
8,5,14,JERRY,"That is so cool, can you put me on the speaker?"
8,5,14,ELAINE,"Oh yeah, sure. Gimme a break."
8,5,17,JERRY,"Hey, Copernicus?"
8,5,18,JEANINE,Eddie Sherman is here.
8,5,18,ELAINE,"Oh, great. Send him in."
8,5,20,EDDIE,You wanted to see me?
8,5,20,ELAINE,"Eddie. Yes, um, I am so sorry but I'm afraid we're gonna have to..."
8,5,22,JERRY,"So, what did you say?"
8,5,22,ELAINE,"Well, I called him all the way up to my office, so I had to tell him"
8,5,23,JERRY,What? What did you--
8,5,23,ELAINE,Copywriter.
8,5,23,JERRY,He's writing copy?
8,5,23,ELAINE,Well it can't be any worse than the pointless drivel we normally churn
8,5,25,KRAMER,Yowza yowza. Check it out.
8,5,25,JERRY,Jewish singles night?
8,5,25,KRAMER,I expect you both to be there.
8,5,25,ELAINE,I'm not Jewish.
8,5,25,KRAMER,Well neither am I.
8,5,25,JERRY,Well why are you going?
8,5,25,KRAMER,"I'm not, I'm running it."
8,5,25,JERRY,What are you talking about?
8,5,25,KRAMER,"Well Lomez, he usually runs it but he's in the Everglades."
8,5,25,JERRY,Lomez is Jewish?
8,5,25,KRAMER,"Oh yeah yeah yeah. Orthodox, Jerry. Old school."
8,5,25,ELAINE,At the Knights of Columbus?
8,5,25,KRAMER,"Yeah, Frank Costanza, he's getting me a room at his lodge. So Jerry,"
8,5,26,JERRY,"Kramer, you know, I--"
8,5,26,KRAMER,"No, Jerry, look I'm cooking all the food myself."
8,5,26,ELAINE,A tempting schmear of authentic Jewish delicacies.
8,5,26,KRAMER,Do you like tsimmis?
8,5,27,ABBY,My mentor says the duck is outstanding here.
8,5,27,JERRY,"I'm not really a duck fan, the skin seems sort of human."
8,5,27,ABBY,"Oh! Look who's here, Cynthia!"
8,5,27,CYNTHIA,"Hello, Abby."
8,5,27,ABBY,"Hello. Jerry, this is Cynthia Pearlman, my mentor."
8,5,27,JERRY,Hello.
8,5,27,CYNTHIA,"Hi Jerry, nice to finally meet you."
8,5,27,ABBY,"Well come join us, we could pull up a chair."
8,5,27,CYNTHIA,"Great, my boyfriend's just parking the car. Actually, Jerry, you"
8,5,28,JERRY,No kidding?
8,5,28,CYNTHIA,Kenny Banya.
8,5,28,JERRY,Banya?
8,5,29,BANYA,"Hey, Jerry!! How's it going?! You gonna join us for dinner? The duck"
8,5,31,GEORGE,"Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, I noticed that you have a textbook"
8,5,32,MAN,Reading for the Blind. They can get any book on tape.
8,5,32,GEORGE,"I tell ya, I am hooked on these books on tape."
8,5,32,MAN,"Oh, tell me about it. These things have ruined me for Braille."
8,5,33,JERRY,Reading for the Blind?
8,5,33,GEORGE,"I take an eye test; I flunk it, the next thing you know I am swinging"
8,5,34,JERRY,"So, I finally met the mentor."
8,5,34,GEORGE,What's she like? Impressive?
8,5,34,JERRY,"Oh yeah, she's dating Banya."
8,5,34,GEORGE,Banya?
8,5,34,JERRY,Yeah. I had to spend two hours at dinner last night with that specimen.
8,5,34,GEORGE,What did you have?
8,5,34,JERRY,"Chicken, how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time"
8,5,35,GEORGE,Marsala?
8,5,35,JERRY,"Piccata, if anything I should be dating a mentor and Banya should be"
8,5,36,GEORGE,"Alright, I got a test to fail."
8,5,36,JERRY,"Hey, good luck with that."
8,5,36,GEORGE,Thank you.
8,5,37,GEORGE,Dad.
8,5,37,FRANK,"What are you wearing, an athletic sweat suit?"
8,5,37,GEORGE,What are you doing here?
8,5,37,KRAMER,"Well, he came by to pick up his check for the banquet hall. You know I"
8,5,38,JERRY,"Kramer, how are you gonna cook Jewish delicacies for a hundred and"
8,5,39,KRAMER,"Yeah, you're right. That's a lot of pupkitz. Hey Frank, you know"
8,5,40,FRANK,"Cook? No, I don't know any cooks. I don't know anything about cooking!"
8,5,41,KRAMER,What's the matter with him?
8,5,41,GEORGE,"My dad was a cook during the Korean War. Something very bad happened,"
8,5,42,KRAMER,Shell-shocked?
8,5,42,GEORGE,"Oh yeah, but that has nothing to do with it."
8,5,43,ELAINE,"That's good work, guys. That aught to do it for today."
8,5,43,EDDIE,Wait. You didn't ask me about my ideas.
8,5,43,ELAINE,"Oh, Eddie, well it's your first day."
8,5,43,EDDIE,I'm ready.
8,5,43,ELAINE,"Oh, okay."
8,5,43,EDDIE,It's a hot night. The mind races. You think about your
8,5,46,ELAINE,What am I gonna do? He is a disaster.
8,5,46,JERRY,"Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe he's in line for another promotion."
8,5,46,ELAINE,"You know what? You are exactly right. That is what I should do, I"
8,5,49,GEORGE,Nothing at all.
8,5,49,DOCTOR,"Well George, your vision is quite impaired. If you'll just sign this"
8,5,51,GEORGE,"You're a very handsome man, by the way."
8,5,52,JERRY,What the hell is going on here?
8,5,54,JERRY,What are you doing?
8,5,54,KRAMER,"I got three kitchens going. I got brisket going at Newman's, I got"
8,5,55,JERRY,"No, I don't want to."
8,5,55,KRAMER,"Eat, eat! You're skin and bones."
8,5,56,KRAMER,Hah?
8,5,56,JERRY,"Oh, this is awful."
8,5,56,KRAMER,"Jerry, it's kreplach. It's an acquired taste, yeah."
8,5,57,JERRY,Did you follow the recipe?
8,5,57,KRAMER,The recipe was for four to six people; I had to multiply for a hundred
8,5,58,JERRY,It tastes like dirt.
8,5,58,KRAMER,"Well I also dropped it on the way over. Look I'm in trouble, I got no"
8,5,60,JERRY,"Kramer, you can't talk to Frank."
8,5,60,KRAMER,"No I gotta talk to him, I know that he can help me, Jerry."
8,5,61,ABBY,I think there's a dead animal in the elevator.
8,5,61,KRAMER,My stuffed cabbage!
8,5,62,ABBY,"So, great dinner last night."
8,5,62,JERRY,"Yeah, it was alright."
8,5,62,ABBY,I told Cynthia we'd double with her and Banya Saturday and then catch his
8,5,63,JERRY,"No. No, no way, no Banya."
8,5,63,ABBY,What?
8,5,63,JERRY,Have you seen his act? He's got a twelve-minute bit about Ovaltine.
8,5,64,ABBY,Cynthia would not date a hack.
8,5,64,JERRY,Would. Does. Is.
8,5,65,ELAINE,"Before we get started, I am happy to tell you that Eddie Sherman is no"
8,5,67,ELAINE,"He's upstairs, I made him Director of Corporate Development."
8,5,67,EMPLOYEE,You promoted him?
8,5,67,ELAINE,"Well, no, I would hardly--"
8,5,67,EMPLOYEE,I bust my hump ever day.
8,5,67,ELAINE,Relax--
8,5,67,EMPLOYEE,"As far as I'm concerned, you and your deranged protégé can run the"
8,5,70,ELAINE,"Well, hey? Hey. Hey!!"
8,5,72,VOICE,Chapter one. In order to manage risk we must first understand risk.
8,5,73,GEORGE,This guy sounds just like me.
8,5,73,VOICE,"To understand risk, we must first define risk."
8,5,73,GEORGE,This is horrible.
8,5,73,VOICE,Risk is defined as--
8,5,73,GEORGE,Stop it! Stop it!
8,5,74,KRAMER,"C'mon Frank, I need you. I mean the war was fifty years ago."
8,5,74,FRANK,"In my mind, there's a war still going on."
8,5,74,KRAMER,"Alright, what happened, Frank? What is it that you can't get over?"
8,5,75,FRANK,"Inchon, Korea, 1950. I was the best cook Uncle Sam ever saw, slinging"
8,5,80,KRAMER,What happened?
8,5,80,FRANK,I went too far. I over seasoned it. Men were keeling over all around
8,5,82,KRAMER,"Frank, you were a boy too. And it was war. It was a crazy time for"
8,5,83,FRANK,Tell that to Bobby Colby. All that kid wanted to do was go home. Well
8,5,85,KRAMER,"Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred Jewish singles need you. This is"
8,5,86,FRANK,"No. No, I'll never cook again! Never! Now get out of my house!! Get"
8,5,88,JERRY,So you saw Banya's act?
8,5,88,ABBY,He got two minutes into that Ovaltine thing and I just couldn't take it
8,5,89,JERRY,"I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges."
8,5,89,ABBY,Why is he so obsessed with Ovaltine?
8,5,89,JERRY,He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny.
8,5,89,ABBY,"Anyway, Cynthia and I got into this big argument afterwards and I think"
8,5,90,JERRY,No more mentor?
8,5,90,ABBY,Looks that way.
8,5,90,JERRY,Well at least you and I are okay again.
8,5,90,ABBY,Actually I was kind of thinking that maybe we shouldn't see each other
8,5,91,JERRY,Why?
8,5,91,ABBY,Well I'm feeling a little disoriented. It's just weird for me not to
8,5,92,JERRY,I can tell you what to do.
8,5,92,ABBY,"No, it's more than that."
8,5,92,JERRY,I can tell you what to think.
8,5,92,ABBY,I need someone I can trust.
8,5,92,JERRY,Oh.
8,5,93,GEORGE,"I got a big problem here, Jerry. The tapes are worthless."
8,5,93,JERRY,"Kind of in the middle of something here, George."
8,5,94,JERRY,George?
8,5,94,ABBY,I gotta run anyway.
8,5,94,JERRY,I can't believe you feel you really need a mentor.
8,5,94,ABBY,I just need someone who can give me some kind of direction. I'll see ya.
8,5,94,JERRY,"Yeah, see ya."
8,5,95,JERRY,What's your problem.
8,5,96,GEORGE,No problem.
8,5,98,EDDIE,"Hey, I think I got something here. The Bengalese Galoshes."
8,5,98,ELAINE,Oh.
8,5,98,EDDIE,It's tough keeping your feet dry when you're kicking in a
8,5,99,ELAINE,"You know, Eddie, that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear."
8,5,99,EDDIE,"Well, I'm not married to it."
8,5,102,EDDIE,Dewy meadow.
8,5,103,ESTELLE,Here's your omelet.
8,5,103,FRANK,It's dry.
8,5,103,ESTELLE,That's the way I always make it.
8,5,103,FRANK,Well it sucks.
8,5,103,ESTELLE,What did you say?
8,5,103,FRANK,"Your meatloaf is mushy, your salmon croquettes are oily and your"
8,5,104,ESTELLE,"Well that's too bad, because I'm the only one who cooks around here!"
8,5,104,FRANK,"Not any more! Gimme that spatula! I'm back, baby!"
8,5,105,ABBY,And you're sure with your busy schedule you'd have time to take on a
8,5,106,GEORGE,"I'll make time, because Abby, I was once like you; wide-eyed, naive, I"
8,5,107,ABBY,"I'm not familiar with that, you'll have to explain it to me."
8,5,107,GEORGE,"I'll tell you what, why don't you read this book and let's just see if"
8,5,108,ABBY,Alright.
8,5,108,GEORGE,Okay.
8,5,109,BANYA,Hey Jerry.
8,5,109,JERRY,"Oh, hey Banya."
8,5,109,BANYA,Didja hear what happened? The mentor saw my act. She dumped me.
8,5,109,JERRY,"Oh, that's too bad."
8,5,109,BANYA,Maybe she's right. Maybe I am a complete hack. I'm the absolute worst.
8,5,110,JERRY,Well it's just that you got so many things with the milk. You got that
8,5,111,BANYA,You think you can give me a hand with my material?
8,5,112,KRAMER,Hey.
8,5,112,FRANK,You still need a cook?
8,5,112,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, come on in, Frank."
8,5,112,FRANK,Ya got T-Fal?
8,5,112,KRAMER,Keflon.
8,5,112,FRANK,No! Follow me.
8,5,113,BANYA,Why do they call it Ovaltine? The mug is round. The jar is
8,5,115,ELAINE,"Let's just replace ""hail of shrapnel"" and ""scar tissue"" with ""string of"
8,5,117,JERRY,George Costanza is your mentor?
8,5,117,ABBY,"Yeah, he's great! I am learning so much."
8,5,118,JERRY,About what? How to calculate five percent of a restaurant check?
8,5,118,ABBY,You know what your problem is? You just have no respect for the
8,5,119,JERRY,"As a matter of fact, I happen to have a protégé of my own."
8,5,120,ABBY,Who?
8,5,120,JERRY,A Mister Kenneth Banya.
8,5,120,ABBY,Banya?
8,5,120,JERRY,I'm gonna mentor this kid to the top.
8,5,120,ABBY,"Huh, well, I don't think I want to date a mentor whose protégé is a hack."
8,5,121,JERRY,"Well, I don't think I want to date a protégé whose mentor is a Costanza."
8,5,122,ELAINE,"I don't know how we did it, but there's some kind of chemistry between"
8,5,123,EDDIE,Cool.
8,5,123,ELAINE,"Hey Ed, let me ask you something. What's with the fatigues and all the"
8,5,124,EDDIE,I don't want to talk about it.
8,5,124,ELAINE,"Come on, don't be a baby."
8,5,124,EDDIE,"I went out on a couple of dates with this woman, I thought she really"
8,5,125,ELAINE,That's it?
8,5,125,EDDIE,"Well it's tough meeting somebody you like, let alone somebody Jewish."
8,5,126,ELAINE,Mm. This food is fantastic.
8,5,126,JERRY,Have you tried the hamentashen?
8,5,126,ELAINE,I can't get off the kishkas.
8,5,126,BANYA,Hey Jerry!
8,5,126,JERRY,Banya?
8,5,126,BANYA,I just stopped by to thank you. That risk management stuff you wrote
8,5,127,JERRY,Risk management?
8,5,127,BANYA,"Aw, it's gold, Jerry! Gold! I got all these corporate gigs and even"
8,5,129,WOMAN,So you went from the mailroom to the director of corporate development
8,5,130,EDDIE,That's right.
8,5,130,WOMAN,How much are they paying you? I'll double it.
8,5,131,KRAMER,Ya know these latkes are going like hotcakes.
8,5,131,FRANK,Where's the powdered sugar?
8,5,131,KRAMER,"You know Frank, you could take a break."
8,5,131,FRANK,"No breaks. I fell reborn, I'm like a Phoenix rising from Arizona."
8,5,132,ELAINE,You're quitting?
8,5,132,EDDIE,I can't churn out that pointless drivel any more.
8,5,132,ELAINE,"Well, you can't quit, you're all I've got. I need you!"
8,5,137,VOICE,Our next speaker is George Costanza on the subject of risk management.
8,5,138,GEORGE,Ovaltine. Have you ever had this stuff? Why is it called Ovaltine?
8,5,139,GEORGE,They should call it round tine. You know what I'm talking about.
8,5,139,WILHELM,He's my protégé.
8,5,139,FRANK,Noooo!!! Don't eat it! No good!
8,5,139,THE END,
