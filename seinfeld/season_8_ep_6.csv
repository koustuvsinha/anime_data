8,6,0,THE CHECKS,"Written by Steve O'Donnell, Tom Gammill & Max Pross"
8,6,3,JERRY,"Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs?"
8,6,4,ELAINE,"Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach."
8,6,4,JERRY,"Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get"
8,6,6,ELAINE,"What is this, a 'bit'?"
8,6,6,JERRY,No.
8,6,6,ELAINE,'Cos I'm not in the mood.
8,6,6,JERRY,We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If
8,6,7,ELAINE,"Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit."
8,6,7,JERRY,They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well.
8,6,7,ELAINE,"Alright, are you done with your little amusement?"
8,6,7,JERRY,Then you admit it was amusing?
8,6,7,ELAINE,"It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, and"
8,6,8,JERRY,Great. Thanks.
8,6,12,ELAINE,"So, your firm designed all the furniture in here?"
8,6,12,BRETT,We manufacture it. The original designs are by Karl Farbman.
8,6,13,ELAINE,"Oh, Farbman."
8,6,13,BRETT,You know Farbman?
8,6,13,ELAINE,"Mm, love Farbman."
8,6,13,BRETT,Most people go their whole lives without sitting in a Farbman.
8,6,13,ELAINE,"Wuh, if you call that living. Ahaha."
8,6,16,ELAINE,Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes?
8,6,18,ELAINE,Brett? Don't you think that would be great?
8,6,19,ELAINE,Brett?
8,6,19,BRETT,"After the song, babe."
8,6,19,ELAINE,Huh?
8,6,19,BRETT,The song.
8,6,24,JERRY,So when do I meet this jerk?
8,6,24,ELAINE,"He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman."
8,6,24,JERRY,Who?
8,6,24,ELAINE,"I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous,"
8,6,25,JERRY,What song?
8,6,25,ELAINE,Desperado.
8,6,25,JERRY,Desperado?
8,6,25,ELAINE,Uh huh.
8,6,25,JERRY,And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado.
8,6,27,JERRY,"See that salesman, twirling that umbrella."
8,6,27,ELAINE,Uh huh.
8,6,27,JERRY,I invented that.
8,6,27,ELAINE,"That, had to be invented?"
8,6,27,JERRY,"When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to"
8,6,29,ELAINE,"Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?"
8,6,30,JERRY,Elaine.
8,6,30,ELAINE,"Excuse me. Hey, how you doing. Uhm, my, uh, friend here says that he"
8,6,31,JERRY,"Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history"
8,6,32,CLICKY,Teddy Padillac came up with this twirl.
8,6,32,ELAINE,Ohh.
8,6,32,JERRY,I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth.
8,6,32,CLICKY,"Yeah, that's where he come up with it."
8,6,32,JERRY,In his dreams.
8,6,32,ELAINE,"Alright, can we go?"
8,6,33,JERRY,"By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the"
8,6,37,JERRY,It's the twirling that dazzles the eye.
8,6,37,GEORGE,I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway?
8,6,38,JERRY,Those belong to people.
8,6,40,KRAMER,Hey. Well. This was downstairs for you.
8,6,41,JERRY,"Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster"
8,6,42,GEORGE,What checks?
8,6,42,KRAMER,"Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan."
8,6,42,JERRY,I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening
8,6,43,KRAMER,"Yeah, the Super Terrific Happy Hour."
8,6,43,JERRY,They run it
8,6,44,GEORGE,Look at all of those! You're rich!
8,6,44,JERRY,Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain in
8,6,48,KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry, you need any new furniture?"
8,6,48,JERRY,Why?
8,6,48,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, Elaine's"
8,6,51,GEORGE,He's giving you furniture? Who is this guy?
8,6,51,JERRY,"Ah, who are any of her losers?"
8,6,51,GEORGE,You're on that list.
8,6,52,GEORGE,"Alright, I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet"
8,6,53,KRAMER,"Oh, no, no, no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?"
8,6,53,EGO,"Yeah, you heard of 'em?"
8,6,53,KRAMER,They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means
8,6,54,GEORGE,"So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless"
8,6,55,JERRY,"I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning."
8,6,58,JERRY,Signed over a hundred checks this morning.
8,6,58,KRAMER,"Hello, twelve dollars."
8,6,60,MR OH,Excuse me. Would you take picture please?
8,6,60,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah, sure."
8,6,62,JERRY,I'm gonna ask this guy something.
8,6,65,JERRY,Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented
8,6,68,KRAMER,"Hey, are you folks from Japan."
8,6,68,MR YAMAGUCHI,Hai.
8,6,68,MR OH,Yes.
8,6,68,KRAMER,You recognise that mug?
8,6,70,KRAMER,That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super
8,6,71,MR OH,"Ahh, Super Terrific Happy..."
8,6,72,KRAMER,"Ah, yeah. Yeah, that's him."
8,6,74,MR OH,What is he doing?
8,6,74,KRAMER,"Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure."
8,6,74,MR OH,He's funny.
8,6,74,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, very funny. And it wouldn't be impolite to laugh at his"
8,6,77,KRAMER,"Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Because everybody laughs at Jerry here in"
8,6,83,CREW LEADER,We're pretty much finished.
8,6,84,CREW LEADER,There's just one more thing.
8,6,84,GEORGE,Here it comes.
8,6,85,CREW LEADER,You forgot to sign your check.
8,6,86,GEORGE,"Sorry. You're sure, uh, there isn't anything"
8,6,87,CREW LEADER,No.
8,6,89,GEORGE,"So, that's it?"
8,6,89,CREW LEADER,Unless you need a receipt.
8,6,89,GEORGE,I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing.
8,6,90,CREW LEADER,Good luck with that.
8,6,95,JERRY,Hey.
8,6,95,ELAINE,What's with the claw?
8,6,95,JERRY,Super terrific carpal tunnel syndrome.
8,6,96,BRETT,There's no sign of Kramer.
8,6,96,ELAINE,"Oh, Brett. This is Jerry."
8,6,96,JERRY,Hi.
8,6,98,BRETT,That's very funny. Elaine told me you were some kinda comedian.
8,6,98,JERRY,"Ah, I'm one kind."
8,6,99,ELAINE,Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer?
8,6,99,JERRY,The Fleckman.
8,6,99,BRETT,Farbman.
8,6,99,JERRY,Right.
8,6,99,ELAINE,You gotta see 'em. Beautiful.
8,6,99,JERRY,"Oh, I'm sure they are."
8,6,99,BRETT,I'd be happy to get you some if that's what you're driving at.
8,6,99,JERRY,"No. I'm fine, thank you."
8,6,99,BRETT,Don't worry. It's no charge to you.
8,6,100,BRETT,Looks like what you really need is a decent desk for writing your
8,6,101,JERRY,I don't write skits.
8,6,101,BRETT,"Well, of course you don't. You don't have a"
8,6,102,ELAINE,"Mmm. Brett, uhm, Jerry doesn't have a fax machine."
8,6,102,BRETT,Oops.
8,6,103,BRETT,"Well, I'm sure things'll pick up for you soon. Elaine, maybe we should"
8,6,105,ELAINE,"Oh. Jerry, you wanna join us?"
8,6,105,JERRY,"Oh, where you going? The coffee shop?"
8,6,105,BRETT,Coffee shop? I think we can do a little better than that. You
8,6,106,JERRY,You look like you could use a...
8,6,106,ELAINE,Jerry.
8,6,109,KRAMER,"Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr Oh, how much would these run"
8,6,111,MR OH,"Ahh, about, uh, thirty thousand yen."
8,6,111,KRAMER,Thirty thousand?! These are practically free.
8,6,112,KRAMER,Giddyup. You're a cowboy now.
8,6,115,BRETT,I feel terrible about your friend Jerry. He's upset that I gave Kramer
8,6,116,ELAINE,Why? Why d'you think he's upset?
8,6,116,BRETT,How could he not be? Living in that cramped little apartment. And
8,6,117,ELAINE,"We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we?"
8,6,117,BRETT,I hope not.
8,6,120,ELAINE,Brett? Everything alright?
8,6,121,ELAINE,Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?
8,6,121,BRETT,"Elaine, the song."
8,6,121,ELAINE,"Oh. Oh, oh, phew. You know, for a minute there I thought"
8,6,123,BRETT,"Elaine, could you just not talk for one minute?"
8,6,123,ELAINE,Sorry.
8,6,126,JERRY,No spiel?
8,6,126,GEORGE,Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call
8,6,127,JERRY,So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to
8,6,128,GEORGE,They could've at least tried!
8,6,128,JERRY,"You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?"
8,6,128,GEORGE,Please.
8,6,128,JERRY,Too dumb?
8,6,130,JERRY,Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds.
8,6,130,KRAMER,"Konichi-wa. Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends. (sits beside"
8,6,132,JERRY,Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around.
8,6,132,KRAMER,"Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi"
8,6,135,KRAMER,That's right.
8,6,135,GEORGE,How'd you hook up with these guys?
8,6,135,KRAMER,"Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See"
8,6,136,JERRY,What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan?
8,6,136,KRAMER,"Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did."
8,6,136,GEORGE,"Yeah, the pilot!"
8,6,136,KRAMER,"That's right, I think that had marvellous production values."
8,6,136,GEORGE,"And, you know, I do a lotta business with Japanese TV."
8,6,138,JERRY,Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed.
8,6,138,GEORGE,"It failed here! Because, here, every time you turn on a"
8,6,141,KRAMER,"George is right, Jerry. See, here, you're just another apple, but in"
8,6,149,TV JERRY,You had a date? You went out with my butler?! Who said you could go
8,6,150,TV ELAINE,"Well, why do I need your permission?"
8,6,150,TV JERRY,Because he's my butler.
8,6,151,GEORGE,So? What d'you think?
8,6,151,EXECUTIVE 1,We're bit confused. Why was this man Jerry's butler?
8,6,151,GEORGE,"Ah. You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car"
8,6,153,EXECUTIVE 1,Is this customary in your legal system?
8,6,153,JERRY,No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.
8,6,153,EXECUTIVE 1,
8,6,153,EXECUTIVE 2,
8,6,154,EXECUTIVE 1,I'm sorry. I'm sure Mr Seinfeld is very
8,6,155,GEORGE,"Oh, I, uh, I disagree. You've, uh, you've been living in America too"
8,6,159,EXECUTIVE 1,
8,6,160,JERRY,Sorry. My hand is numb.
8,6,160,GEORGE,Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy
8,6,161,EXECUTIVE 1,You must go now.
8,6,166,ELAINE,"Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during"
8,6,167,JERRY,What does he listen to? The all Desperado
8,6,168,ELAINE,"He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm"
8,6,169,JERRY,"You know, what you need is a song you can share."
8,6,169,ELAINE,Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song.
8,6,169,JERRY,"Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about?"
8,6,170,ELAINE,I like Witchy Woman.
8,6,170,JERRY,Witchy Woman?
8,6,170,ELAINE,"You know, Witchy Woman. 'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'."
8,6,170,JERRY,Ahh. Wit-chay Woman.
8,6,172,KRAMER,"Hey, man."
8,6,172,ELAINE,Hey.
8,6,174,JERRY,Hey. How was the Rainbow Room?
8,6,174,KRAMER,"Uh, well, we, uh, we had to leave early. There was a, uh, slight"
8,6,175,JERRY,Ah.
8,6,175,KRAMER,"Uh, listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows?"
8,6,175,JERRY,What for?
8,6,176,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, uh, my Japanese friends're gonna stay with me."
8,6,176,JERRY,I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?
8,6,177,KRAMER,"Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like you"
8,6,178,JERRY,"Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear?"
8,6,178,KRAMER,"Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with"
8,6,180,ELAINE,Fifty thousand yen? Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?
8,6,180,KRAMER,"Evidently. Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest of"
8,6,181,ELAINE,In them?!
8,6,181,JERRY,You have them sleeping in drawers?!
8,6,181,KRAMER,"Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in"
8,6,182,JERRY,This has 'international incident' written all over it.
8,6,182,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, yeah."
8,6,186,KRAMER,"Goodnight, Mr Tanaka."
8,6,187,MR TANAKA,Goodnight.
8,6,189,KRAMER,"Goodnight, Mr Oh."
8,6,189,MR OH,Goodnight.
8,6,191,KRAMER,"Goodnight, Mr Yamaguchi."
8,6,191,MR YAMAGUCHI,"Oh, yes. Goodnight."
8,6,196,JERRY,What is this?
8,6,196,KRAMER,"Rice Crispies. East meets West, Jerry."
8,6,196,JERRY,"Ah. It's a lovely little bureau and breakfast you're running. Well,"
8,6,197,KRAMER,Sayonara.
8,6,197,JERRY,Konichi-wa.
8,6,202,BRETT,"Elaine, I..."
8,6,202,ELAINE,Shh-shh! What d'you think?
8,6,203,ELAINE,What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song.
8,6,203,BRETT,"Witchy Woman is okay for you, but I've already got a song."
8,6,203,ELAINE,"Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado? We can share it."
8,6,203,BRETT,No. It's mine.
8,6,210,KRAMER,"Here you go. Snap, crackle and pop."
8,6,211,KRAMER,"Good morning, Mr Oh. I gotta make up the drawer."
8,6,211,MR OH,"Ach, come back in half hour."
8,6,217,JERRY,"Hey, I'll take one."
8,6,217,CLICKY,"Well, look who's back!"
8,6,218,CLICKY,Teddy! This's the guy says he invented the twirl.
8,6,218,TEDDY,Jerry Seinfeld!
8,6,218,JERRY,"Teddy Padillac. Long time, no see. What've"
8,6,219,TEDDY,"Same thing we had, when you bailed on us, fifteen years ago."
8,6,219,JERRY,"Bailed? C'mon, you knew I wanted to be a comedian. Besides, we had"
8,6,220,TEDDY,"Oh, yeah, sure. But where were you during the poncho craze of"
8,6,223,CLICKY,"Umbrella, buddy?"
8,6,224,CLICKY,Now we got that damn 'urban sombrero' to contend with.
8,6,224,TEDDY,"Easy, there. I hear you're taking credit for"
8,6,225,JERRY,"Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares?"
8,6,225,TEDDY,I care. Clicky cares.
8,6,225,JERRY,"So, could I..."
8,6,226,JERRY,Could I just buy an umbrella?
8,6,226,TEDDY,"Yeah, sure. Two hundred dollars."
8,6,226,JERRY,What?!
8,6,226,TEDDY,"Special price, for a real foul-weather friend."
8,6,230,KRAMER,"Hey, George. How about that tour, huh? These guys are ready to run"
8,6,231,GEORGE,"Kramer, it's, it's raining. They got the tarp"
8,6,232,KRAMER,"Ah, listen, George, what else can I do with these guys?"
8,6,234,GEORGE,"Well, I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show."
8,6,234,KRAMER,"That's perfect. Hey, how would"
8,6,236,MR OH,"But, we are also very hungry."
8,6,236,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, you guys just watch the"
8,6,239,KRAMER,"Hey, peanuts!"
8,6,240,WILHELM,George. George.
8,6,241,WILHELM,"Uh, George, uh, did you call some carpet cleaners?"
8,6,241,GEORGE,Are they here?
8,6,241,WILHELM,"They're in my office, right now."
8,6,241,GEORGE,"They haven't said anything to you, have they?"
8,6,241,WILHELM,About what?
8,6,241,GEORGE,"What kind of a snobby, stuck-up, cult is"
8,6,246,BRETT,Hey Jerry!
8,6,247,JERRY,"Oh, hi Brett."
8,6,247,BRETT,Haven't you ever heard of an umbrella?
8,6,247,JERRY,"Ah, I didn't have enough money."
8,6,247,BRETT,I'm sure things'll pick up for you.
8,6,247,JERRY,"No, it's not that, it's the..."
8,6,250,JERRY,"Oh no, look at the checks! Hours of hard work ruined!"
8,6,251,BRETT,"Ah, don't worry, I can spot you the twelve cents?"
8,6,251,JERRY,"No, it's not the money. It's my hand. It's crippled from writing and"
8,6,252,BRETT,"Nothing's working for you, is is?"
8,6,252,JERRY,"Not at the moment, Brett."
8,6,252,BRETT,"I'd give you a ride, but I got Karl Farbman here."
8,6,253,JERRY,Thanks for stopping!
8,6,257,ELAINE,"Brett said you ran away from him, as if he were the boogetyman."
8,6,257,JERRY,Boogeyman.
8,6,257,ELAINE,Boogey?
8,6,257,JERRY,"I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song?"
8,6,257,ELAINE,"No. He blew out my Witchy Woman, and he won't share Desperado. Hey,"
8,6,258,JERRY,Eehh.
8,6,258,ELAINE,"Well, I'm running outta guys here in this city, Jer!"
8,6,260,JERRY,Hey.
8,6,260,GEORGE,Great news! I showed the pilot to Kramer's Japanese
8,6,261,JERRY,Really? They bought the butler character?
8,6,261,GEORGE,Did I tell you that story's relatable?! That was a great
8,6,262,GEORGE,Nakahama Broadcast Corporation.
8,6,263,JERRY,Ah. But they told us we must go now.
8,6,263,GEORGE,"But now I have my own market research. Actual Japanese viewers, that"
8,6,265,JERRY,"Hey, George, do me a favour. If they make you an offer, whatever it"
8,6,268,GEORGE,"Hey, by the way, what'd you think of Miss Yoshimura?"
8,6,268,JERRY,Who?
8,6,268,GEORGE,The network executive. You think she liked me?
8,6,277,KRAMER,Heyy! Look who's here.
8,6,278,KRAMER,"Come on, I want you to come in here."
8,6,280,MR OH,"Come on in, fat boy!"
8,6,281,GEORGE,"Get a good night's sleep, alright fellas. Big day"
8,6,286,JERRY,Last one.
8,6,288,JERRY,Uugh! Ahh.
8,6,291,KRAMER,There you are.
8,6,292,GEORGE,Uh. Where's the boys?
8,6,292,KRAMER,"Uh, no, I let 'em sleep in."
8,6,293,KRAMER,I'm on my way to cash in their plane tickets for them. They need a
8,6,294,GEORGE,But that meeting starts in ten minutes!
8,6,294,KRAMER,"No, well, I set their alarm. But they did have a lot of sake in that"
8,6,296,GEORGE,I'm calling Jerry.
8,6,299,JERRY,Yeah?
8,6,299,GEORGE,Jerry! The Japanese guys had sake in the
8,6,301,JERRY,Uncle Leo?
8,6,301,GEORGE,Jerry!!
8,6,303,JERRY,"Alright, alright. I'll wake 'em up."
8,6,304,JERRY,"Hmm, testy."
8,6,308,JERRY,Hello?
8,6,308,MR OH,"Mr Jerry! Open the drawer, please!"
8,6,310,JERRY,It's stuck. Oww! The steam from the hot-tub musta warped the
8,6,311,MR OH,Pull harder.
8,6,311,JERRY,I'm trying. I can't get a grip. My hand's had kind of a bad week.
8,6,311,MR OH,"Very funny, but no joking, please."
8,6,311,JERRY,"Don't worry, I'll get you out."
8,6,314,ELAINE,"Brett, believe me. You don't have to do this."
8,6,314,BRETT,"Elaine, I know he'll appreciate this. Granted, it's not as nice as"
8,6,315,ELAINE,"Uh, I promise you, Jerry is not jealous of Kramer's cabinet."
8,6,317,JERRY,Move to the back of the drawers!
8,6,318,ELAINE,Jerry?
8,6,320,ELAINE,Jerry.
8,6,324,BRETT,Not the Farbman!!
8,6,330,MR OH,
8,6,331,EXECUTIVE 1,
8,6,334,GEORGE,"So, uh, gentlemen, do we have a deal?"
8,6,334,MR OH,
8,6,335,MR OH,
8,6,338,GEORGE,Excuse me. Did you hire the Sunshine Carpet
