8,7,58,KRAMER,"Jerry these are lode baring walls, they're not gonna come down!"
8,7,58,JERRY,"Yea, that's no good."
8,7,58,KRAMER,I may have to drive that place out of business.

8,7,75,SETH,"Yea, I'm the new manager"
8,7,75,JERRY,"But your were an executive, this is fast food."
8,7,75,SETH,"Not fast food, good food served quickly."
8,7,76,KRAMER,"Hey, stay away from the chicken, bad chicken, mess you up."
8,7,76,SETH,That's not going to be good for business.
8,7,76,JERRY,That's not going to be good for anybody.
8,7,77,JERRY,"If I'm gonna live over there, you gotta take some of this stuff out."
8,7,80,KRAMER,Mr. Marbles? He's harmless.
8,7,80,JERRY,"And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my..."
8,7,82,JERRY,Oh no.
8,7,82,NEWMAN,Nice place you got here Kramer a man can really get some
8,7,83,JERRY,"Well don't get too comfortable, as soon as Seth gets a real job you two"
8,7,86,KRAMER,What is that Roger's Chicken? Oh get that outta here.
8,7,86,NEWMAN,I don't know. The man makes a pretty strong bird.
8,7,86,KRAMER,Well I'm boycotting it.
8,7,87,KRAMER,"What is that, hickory?"
8,7,87,NEWMAN,"Yea, it's the wood that makes it good."
8,7,87,KRAMER,Really?
8,7,87,NEWMAN,Uh-Huh.
8,7,88,KRAMER,Oh stop it.
8,7,90,HEATHER,Can I help you?
8,7,92,ELAINE,"Hi, yea, I'm Elaine Benes, we met at Barney's, I'm a friend of George"
8,7,95,HEATHER,Really?
8,7,95,ELAINE,"I know, he has a real confidence problem."
8,7,95,GEORGE,Well not really...
8,7,95,ELAINE,George...Anyway I know you told him you didn't have the hat because
8,7,97,HEATHER,"Look, I don't know what to tell you, but there's no hat here. I mean,"
8,7,98,GEORGE,Well that makes sense.
8,7,98,ELAINE,Then you wouldn't mind if we took a second look around?
8,7,98,HEATHER,Be my guest.
8,7,99,GEORGE,Good to see you again.
8,7,100,GEORGE,"She's bluffing, she's got it stashed away in there somewhere."
8,7,100,ELAINE,This is an absolute disaster.
8,7,100,GEORGE,"Oh, I don't know. Check this out."
8,7,101,ELAINE,You stole her clock?
8,7,102,ELAINE,Well done.
8,7,102,GEORGE,"Yep, this one for our side!"
8,7,106,JERRY,"What is that creaking, its like I'm in the hold of a ship."
8,7,108,JERRY,"Hello, is somebody there? Mr. Marbles?"
8,7,109,ELAINE,"So I told Ipswitch I'd have the hat by this afternoon, what am I"
8,7,110,KRAMER,You should sleep with him.
8,7,111,JERRY,"Hey everybody, I'm on no sleep, no sleep!. You don't know what it's"
8,7,113,ELAINE,You look a little stressed.
8,7,113,JERRY,Oh I'm stressed!
8,7,113,ELAINE,So Kramer what am I supposed to do? If I don't have that fur hat by
8,7,114,JERRY,You know my friend Bob Sacamano?
8,7,114,ELAINE,I thought he was Kramer's friend.
8,7,114,JERRY,"Well, he called last night about 3 a.m. we got to talking, he sells"
8,7,115,ELAINE,fourty bucks? Are they Sable?
8,7,115,JERRY,"No, but the difference is unnoticeable."
8,7,115,KRAMER,"Oh yea, I like this idea."
8,7,115,ELAINE,"Alright, lets give it a shot, lets go."
8,7,115,JERRY,Giddee up!
8,7,117,NEWMAN,"It's getting cold, it's getting cold."
8,7,117,KRAMER,That was a close one.
8,7,117,NEWMAN,Why do we have to keep this a secret from Jerry?
8,7,117,KRAMER,If Jerry finds out I'm hooked on Roger's chicken I'm back there with
8,7,119,IPSWITCH,"Ms. Benes the hat you charged to the company was Sable, this is"
8,7,120,ELAINE,"Well, that's a kind of sable."
8,7,120,IPSWITCH,"No, its a kind of rat."
8,7,120,ELAINE,That's a rat hat?
8,7,120,IPSWITCH,"And a poorly made one, even by rat hat standards. I have no choice"
8,7,123,ELAINE,"But, but, he's in the Burmese jungle."
8,7,123,IPSWITCH,"Yes, and quite mad from what I hear."
8,7,123,ELAINE,Wait? Can I fire you?
8,7,123,IPSWITCH,No.
8,7,124,KRAMER,So Heather called?
8,7,124,GEORGE,"Yea, but get this, the message said 'call me if you have the time'."
8,7,125,KRAMER,"No, but this is all very exciting."
8,7,125,GEORGE,"She knows that I have her clock, I know that she has my hat, I think"
8,7,126,KRAMER,Of course there's the possibility that you've gone right out of your
8,7,127,GEORGE,"I've looked at that, seems unlikely."
8,7,127,KRAMER,"I'd look again. So, how come you didn't call Jerry about all this?"
8,7,127,GEORGE,"I can't talk to Jerry anymore, even since he moved into that"
8,7,128,KRAMER,That's a shame.
8,7,129,JERRY,"Seth, you're the manager, can't you turn off the sign?"
8,7,129,SETH,"Jerry, I lied, I'm just he assistant manager."
8,7,129,SETH,"Number sixty seven, family feast."
8,7,129,NEWMAN,"Number 67, right here, right here!"
8,7,129,JERRY,Hello Newman.
8,7,129,NEWMAN,Hello Jerry.
8,7,129,SETH,And don't forget your steamed broccoli.
8,7,129,JERRY,"Hold it, Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli if it was deep fried in"
8,7,130,NEWMAN,"I love broccoli, its good for you."
8,7,130,JERRY,Really? Then maybe you'd like to have a piece?
8,7,131,NEWMAN,Gladly.
8,7,132,NEWMAN,Vile weed!
8,7,132,JERRY,It's Kramer isn't it? The greasy door knob the constant licking of
8,7,133,NEWMAN,"Yes, now please. Someone, honey mustard."
8,7,135,KRAMER,"Newman, what took you so long, oh hey buddy."
8,7,135,JERRY,Expecting Newman? That's funny because I happened to find him at
8,7,136,KRAMER,"Kenny Roger's? Whew, boy, I hate that place."
8,7,136,JERRY,"He was buying quite a load of chicken almost for two people, as long"
8,7,137,KRAMER,"Oh hey Elaine stopped by, yea dropped off that Bob Sacamano hat, oh"
8,7,138,JERRY,I sure do miss my apartment maybe I'll switch back.
8,7,138,KRAMER,Oh you don't want to think about that no sir. Otherwise I'd have no
8,7,140,JERRY,"I don't think you will. As a matter of fact I'll save you the trouble,"
8,7,141,KRAMER,"Yea, yea go ahead put the banner up doesn't matter to me."
8,7,141,JERRY,Alright.
8,7,141,KRAMER,"No Jerry! I need that chicken, I gotta have that chicken, you leave"
8,7,142,JERRY,You got a little problem.
8,7,142,KRAMER,Oh I got a big problem Jerry!
8,7,144,PETERMAN,Elaine.
8,7,144,ELAINE,Mr. Peterman.
8,7,146,ELAINE,You speak Burmese?
8,7,146,PETERMAN,"No Elaine, that was gibberish. So did you have any trouble finding"
8,7,147,ELAINE,"No, you're the only white poet warlord in the neighborhood."
8,7,147,PETERMAN,Are you an assassin?
8,7,147,ELAINE,I work for your mail order catalog.
8,7,147,PETERMAN,"You're an errand girl, sent by grocery clerks, to collect a bill."
8,7,147,ELAINE,"Well, actually I do have a bill here, if you could just sign this"
8,7,148,PETERMAN,I'd be happy to Elaine ... but I will have to see this hat.
8,7,149,GEORGE,So how do you want to do this?
8,7,149,HEATHER,"Alright George I'll be honest, the first time we went out, I found"
8,7,152,GEORGE,So you really don't have my hat?
8,7,152,HEATHER,What?
8,7,153,GEORGE,Oh. let's go do something.
8,7,153,HEATHER,What's in bag?
8,7,153,GEORGE,That's a sandwich.
8,7,154,GEORGE,Damn salami.
8,7,154,HEATHER,"My clock, you stole it!"
8,7,154,GEORGE,That damn deli that is last time they screw up one of my orders.
8,7,157,JERRY,"Hey Seth, man it is coming down hard out there."
8,7,159,JERRY,"Oh, gross. That's not gonna be good for business."
8,7,159,SETH,That's not gonna be good for anybody.
8,7,161,KRAMER,Kenny? ... Kenny?
8,7,162,KRAMER,Kenny....
8,7,163,JERRY,Home at last.
8,7,164,JERRY,Is someone there? Mr. Marbles?
8,7,165,ELAINE,"Its the Urban Sombrero, I put it in the last catalog."
8,7,165,PETERMAN,The horror...the horror.
8,7,165,THE END,
