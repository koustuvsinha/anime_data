9,0,5,JERRY,Holland *is* the Netherlands.
9,0,5,GEORGE,Then who are the Dutch?
9,0,5,JERRY,You know I cannot stand this thing anymore.
9,0,5,GEORGE,"I know, I hate it too. I feel like an out of work porn star."
9,0,5,JERRY,"I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation."
9,0,5,GEORGE,Well why didn't we?
9,0,5,JERRY,Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation from
9,0,6,GEORGE,What if we grew muttonchops?

9,0,6,GEORGE,Dammit.
9,0,7,GEORGE,"Hey hey hey, check me out, huh?"
9,0,7,JERRY,"No more crutches, that must be a relief."
9,0,7,GEORGE,"Yeah, with crutches everyone has questions."
9,0,7,JERRY,Not with a cane?
9,0,7,GEORGE,"Nah, with crutches it's a funny story, with a cane it's a sad story. You through with those?"
9,0,8,JERRY,"Always a sad story. Hey, you should have been here tonight. Some guy"
9,0,9,GEORGE,"Alright, we're back in!"

9,0,11,GEORGE,Killed.
9,0,11,JERRY,Because I killed first and warmed up the crowd. He's like that fish that attaches himself to the shark.
9,0,11,GEORGE,And you're the shark?
9,0,11,JERRY,"Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs."
9,0,11,GEORGE,I don't know how a fish could eat laughs.
9,0,11,JERRY,"Well, I'm glad I brought it up."
9,0,12,KRAMER,Got any shredded coconut?
9,0,12,JERRY,"Uh, we're not doing that any more."
9,0,12,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, right."
9,0,12,GEORGE,Oh my god.
9,0,12,JERRY,What?
9,0,12,GEORGE,I got a job interview. They want to see me this afternoon.
9,0,12,JERRY,So what's this job?
9,0,12,GEORGE,"Oh, it's beautiful. It's in sports."
9,0,12,JERRY,Knicks? Rangers?
9,0,12,GEORGE,Playground equipment.
9,0,12,JERRY,Welcome back to the show.
9,0,13,KRAMER,"Yeah, this is better. So, you got any shredded coconut?"
9,0,13,JERRY,No.
9,0,13,GEORGE,I gotta hobble.
9,0,14,KRAMER,D-d-d-d. I gotta switch shaving cream. I'm getting no protection.
9,0,14,JERRY,What kind do you use?
9,0,14,KRAMER,Whatever you get.
9,0,14,JERRY,"Look, postcard from Elaine from Europe."
9,0,14,KRAMER,Don't tell me she's dragging another poor guy across Europe.
9,0,14,JERRY,Remember David Puddy?
9,0,14,KRAMER,"She's dating him again, huh?"
9,0,14,JERRY,"Well, I guess she's batted around and she's back at the top of the order."
9,0,14,KRAMER,"Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine. That guy's coming home in a body bag."
9,0,15,PUDDY,"Well, let's see, I've got a ten kroner, a five kroner, a twenty kroner. No wait, that's another ten kroner. A fimty kroner? How much is that?"
9,0,15,ELAINE,We have to break up.
9,0,15,PUDDY,What?
9,0,15,ELAINE,"I can't take this any more! I don't want to hear how interesting the change with the hole in it is! And if you tell me what time it is in New York again, you are going home in a body bag!"
9,0,15,PUDDY,Well what about you? What do you think The Gap in Rome has that's not in The Gap on Broadway?
9,0,15,ELAINE,"Okay, alright listen. Forget about The Gap because we are through!"
9,0,15,PUDDY,Fine!
9,0,15,ELAINE,Fine!
9,0,15,CAB DRIVER,"Okay, terminal three. Have a nice flight."
9,0,16,CAPTAIN,"Ladies and gentlemen, our flight time, with stopovers, will be approximately 22 hours."
9,0,16,ELAINE,"Hey, you gonna bust out that drink cart or what?"
9,0,17,KRAMER,"Hey, what are you doing?"
9,0,17,JERRY,"Oh, I'm taking this lace out. It came undone and touched the floor of a men's room. That's the end of that."
9,0,17,KRAMER,Did you see Bania's set last night? 'Cause I read on the Internet he killed.
9,0,17,JERRY,He killed. He only does well when he has me for a lead-in. He's a time slot hit.
9,0,17,KRAMER,"Well, you gotta give him some credit. You're just being totally ridiculous. I'll see you later buddy."
9,0,17,JERRY,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute."
9,0,17,KRAMER,What?
9,0,17,JERRY,Do I have to ask?
9,0,17,KRAMER,"I ran out of butter so I had to borrow yours. Anything else, Mr. Nosy?"
9,0,18,JERRY,Why are you buttering your face?
9,0,18,KRAMER,I'm shaving with it.
9,0,18,JERRY,Oh Moses smell the roses.
9,0,18,KRAMER,"Jerry, it's vastly superior to any commercial shaving cream. Now feel my face."
9,0,18,JERRY,No.
9,0,18,KRAMER,Feel it.
9,0,18,JERRY,I don't want to.
9,0,18,KRAMER,Feel it. Feel it.
9,0,19,JERRY,That is close.
9,0,21,GEORGE,I got the job?
9,0,21,MR. THOMASSOULO,"I don't want you to think that anyone's gonna treat you any differently just because of your, uh, handicap."
9,0,21,GEORGE,Handicap? I'm not handicapped.
9,0,21,MR. THOMASSOULO,"I'm sorry. Differently, uh, advantaged."
9,0,21,GEORGE,"Yeah, I didn't mean that."
9,0,21,MR. THOMASSOULO,"Of course you will have your own private, fully equipped bathroom."
9,0,21,GEORGE,When do I start?
9,0,21,MR. THOMASSOULO,"Whenever you feel that you're able. Um, you need a hand here."
9,0,21,GEORGE,"Yeah, what the hell."
9,0,22,JERRY,You got the job?
9,0,22,GEORGE,"Jerry, it's fantastic. I love the people over there. They treat me so great. You know they think I'm handicapped, they gave me this incredible office, a great view."
9,0,22,JERRY,"Hold on, they think you're handicapped?"
9,0,22,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane. You should see the bathroom they gave me!"
9,0,22,JERRY,How can you do this?
9,0,22,GEORGE,"Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped. I'm just now getting the recognition for it. Name one thing I have that puts me in a position of advantage. Huh? There was a guy that worked at the Yankees-- no arms! He got more work done than I did, made more money, had a wife, a family, drove a better car than I did."
9,0,22,JERRY,He drove a car with no arms?
9,0,22,GEORGE,"Alright I made up the part about the car, but the rest is true. He hated me anyway!"
9,0,22,JERRY,Do you know how hard it's getting just to tell people I know you?
9,0,22,GEORGE,"I love that bathroom. It's got that high, high toilet. I feel like a gargoyle perched on the ledge of a building."
9,0,23,KRAMER,They hooked me up.
9,0,23,GEORGE,What's with all the butter?
9,0,23,KRAMER,"I'm shaving with it, and you know what I discovered?"
9,0,23,JERRY,You can eat it?
9,0,23,KRAMER,"No, my face feels so good, I'm gonna use it all over my body."
9,0,24,JERRY,"Oh my god, it's Bania and Jenna."
9,0,24,GEORGE,Who?
9,0,24,JERRY,The tooth brush in the toilet bowl.
9,0,25,BANIA,"Hey Jerry, this is Jenna. Pretty good lookin' huh?"
9,0,25,JENNA,Jerry's the guy that I dated right before you.
9,0,25,BANIA,Oh. This is awkward.
9,0,25,JENNA,"Don't worry, Kenny. After dating Jerry, you're a pleasure."
9,0,26,JERRY,I don't believe this.
9,0,26,GEORGE,"You miss her, don't you?"
9,0,26,JERRY,"No! He's riding my coattails again. He's getting everything off me, first laughs now ladies."
9,0,26,GEORGE,You miss her.
9,0,27,PUDDY,"You know I think ultimately, I'm upset with myself. I knew what I was getting into, she's a bitter, unstable person. I mean the sex was good. I'm sure it was fine for her. I need more."
9,0,27,ELAINE,Huh. You believing this?
9,0,27,PASSENGER,"Excuse me, I was sleeping."
9,0,27,ELAINE,You missed quite a performance.
9,0,28,PASSENGER,That's my apple juice.
9,0,34,JERRY,Someone's cooking.
9,0,34,NEWMAN,"Hello, Jerry."
9,0,34,JERRY,"Hello, Newman."
9,0,34,NEWMAN,"You know, old friend, sometimes I ponder this silly gulf between us and I say, ""Why?"" Are we really so different. For what is--"
9,0,34,JERRY,"I'm not the one doing the cooking, Newman."
9,0,34,NEWMAN,"Damn you Seinfeld. You useless pustule. Um, somebody's got something on the griddle. Maybe it's Kramer."
9,0,34,JERRY,"No, he's up on the roof getting some sun with the butter - pause - Oh no!"
9,0,34,NEWMAN,Butter?
9,0,35,PASSENGER,-Fimty kroner.
9,0,35,ELAINE,"You know my last boyfriend, he had a real kroner"
9,0,37,WOMAN,"David, you are so funny."
9,0,37,PUDDY,"Yeah, I know."
9,0,37,ELAINE,What are you doing?
9,0,37,PUDDY,"It's a long flight, Elaine. I had to get on with my life."
9,0,37,ELAINE,By making time with some floozy across the aisle?
9,0,37,PUDDY,"Yeah, that's right. Well, what's going on over there with you and, uh, vegetable lasagna?"
9,0,37,ELAINE,This guy? He's an idiot. He doesn't mean anything to me.
9,0,37,PASSENGER,I can hear you.
9,0,37,PUDDY,"Well, she doesn't mean anything to me either. If it were up to me, we'd still be together."
9,0,37,ELAINE,Well maybe I feel the same way.
9,0,37,PUDDY,Ok.
9,0,37,ELAINE,"Ok, so now what?"
9,0,37,PUDDY,Let's make out.
9,0,39,JERRY,Kramer!
9,0,39,KRAMER,"Oh, man. I think I cooked myself."
9,0,39,JERRY,Look at your skin.
9,0,39,KRAMER,"Stick a fork in me, Jerry. I'm done."
9,0,40,KRAMER,I'm fried.
9,0,40,JERRY,"Technically, you're saut√©ed. So, what are you doing for that?"
9,0,40,KRAMER,"Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist so I don't dry out."
9,0,40,JERRY,Is that what the doctor said?
9,0,40,KRAMER,"No, I read an article in Bon Appetite magazine."
9,0,41,GEORGE,Hmm. Game hen?
9,0,41,JERRY,"Kind of. Nice limp, you're bringing your work home with you?"
9,0,41,GEORGE,"No, I fake limp on my right. This is a real limp because I sprained my ankle."
9,0,41,JERRY,What happened?
9,0,41,GEORGE,"Well, I was buttering myself up for a nice shave --"
9,0,41,JERRY,"Oh no, not you too?"
9,0,41,GEORGE,I must have dripped some on the floor and I slipped and...
9,0,41,JERRY,You know what's good for that? Relish.
9,0,42,JERRY,"Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? No. No! No! No!! No!!!"
9,0,43,GEORGE,"So what, he's got a couple of good jokes."
9,0,43,JERRY,"Like what, Ovaltine? Why do dogs drink out of the toilet? Shopping"
9,0,44,GEORGE,"That's true, that always happens to me."
9,0,44,JERRY,You think that's funny?
9,0,44,GEORGE,"I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about too much."
9,0,44,JERRY,You like Bania's act. You're a closet Bania fan!
9,0,44,GEORGE,maybe I am.
9,0,44,JERRY,"Oh, I'm gonna puke."
9,0,44,GEORGE,Puke! That's a funny word. Puke. puke! Don't have to
9,0,46,ELAINE,I can't believe we broke up like that.
9,0,47,ELAINE,Do you want something to read?
9,0,47,PUDDY,Nah.
9,0,47,ELAINE,"Well, are you going to take a nap or"
9,0,47,PUDDY,Nah.
9,0,47,ELAINE,You're just going to sit there staring at the back of a seat?
9,0,47,PUDDY,Yeah.
9,0,48,ELAINE,"That's it! I cannot take this! I mean, look at this, nothing has"
9,0,50,PUDDY,"Tell me about it, I don't know why I ever took you back."
9,0,50,ELAINE,"Please! I took you back. You know it, I know it, vegetable lasagna"
9,0,51,VEGETABLE LASAGNA,I don't want to get involved.
9,0,51,ELAINE,"Ugh, I hope a giant mountain rises out of the ocean and we just ram"
9,0,52,VEGETABLE LASAGNA,Oh god.
9,0,54,PASSENGER,Ow! Ow!!
9,0,56,NEWMAN,"How much longer you gonna be, I'm starving here."
9,0,56,KRAMER,Just a few more squirts. Cause I gotta stay juicy.
9,0,56,NEWMAN,"The smell. It's still with you, huh?"
9,0,56,KRAMER,"Yeah, it's baked on it. Put some butter in. Stir it up so it melts."
9,0,58,KRAMER,"Ahh, now I'm simmering."
9,0,59,NEWMAN,I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
9,0,60,MR. THOMASSOULO,"Good morning, George. Is something wrong with your other leg?"
9,0,60,GEORGE,"Oh, no, that's just the old handicap acting up."
9,0,60,MR. THOMASSOULO,But your cane's on the wrong side.
9,0,60,GEORGE,"That's just because we're standing on opposite sides. See, when we"
9,0,63,GEORGE,"See? This looks right to you, doesn't it?"
9,0,63,MR. THOMASSOULO,"Uh, yeah, I guess."
9,0,63,GEORGE,"But, see here."
9,0,64,MR. THOMASSOULO,"Will you stop it, George? Just stop it! I think I can see"
9,0,67,GEORGE,"Well, you're not gonna believe what happened."
9,0,67,JERRY,You mugged Stephen Hawking?
9,0,67,GEORGE,"Play Now thinks I got problems in both legs. My own personal Rascal,"
9,0,69,JERRY,Well it must be comforting to know you'll be going straight to hell at
9,0,71,JERRY,Hello?
9,0,71,ELAINE,Jerry.
9,0,71,JERRY,"Hey, Lainie, how's the trip going?"

9,0,72,GEORGE,How's the trip?
9,0,72,JERRY,Sounded good.
9,0,73,JERRY,"Hey, if you got any juice left, you might wanna roll by the big showcase"
9,0,74,GEORGE,"Ah, you still going on in front of Bania, eh?"
9,0,74,JERRY,"That's right, and I'll tell you what. I'm feeling a little off."
9,0,74,GEORGE,What are you talking about? You're not!
9,0,74,JERRY,"That's right, I'm taking a dive."
9,0,74,GEORGE,You're throwing the set?
9,0,74,JERRY,"I'm laying down! Then let's see how he does up there, without all the"
9,0,75,GEORGE,Listen Jerry. Bania's voice is the voice of a new generation. My
9,0,76,JERRY,We're four months apart.
9,0,76,GEORGE,nevertheless. His time has come.
9,0,78,GEORGE,"Now if you will kindly help me unwedge my front wheel, I'll be on my"

9,0,100,KRAMER,And laughter is the best medicine.
9,0,100,JERRY,"Hey, sorry Kenny. Guess you got your work cut out for you."
9,0,100,CLUB ANNOUNCER,"Ladies and gentlemen, Kenny Bania!"
9,0,101,KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry, he could have used your laugh. He was a big turkey out"
9,0,102,NEWMAN,Turkey?
9,0,102,KRAMER,A big fat turkey.
9,0,102,NEWMAN,I'm sorry I missed that.

9,0,121,STU,Give us a call. We want to be in the Kenny Bania business.
9,0,121,JAY,"By the way, Jerry? The suspenders? A little hacky."
9,0,121,BANIA,How about that Jerry? First you had a pilot on NBC and now I'll have one. Looks like I'm following you again.
9,0,121,JERRY,"Oh, I'm gonna puke."
9,0,121,BANIA,Puke? That's a funny word. Can I use that?
9,0,122,ELAINE,"David, this has been the worst month of my life and if I never see you"
