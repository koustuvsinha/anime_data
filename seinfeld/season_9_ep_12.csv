9,12,1,JERRY,So you're saying UNICEF is a scam?
9,12,1,KRAMER,It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation. No one can keep track of all those kids with the little orange boxes of change.
9,12,1,JERRY,Oh! No it's Sally Weaver.

9,12,2,KRAMER,"Hmmm, Dramatica comedia heh!"
9,12,2,JERRY,"Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation."
9,12,3,KRAMER,Euh.. We don't go to enough theater.
9,12,3,JERRY,She should just give up.

9,12,4,KRAMER,At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't happen it's not gonna happen.
9,12,6,JERRY,So......Susan's dead.....
9,12,7,KRAMER,I think she was happy someone finally said it.
9,12,7,JERRY,Why'd you have to say anything to her?
9,12,7,KRAMER,'felt that the conversation was lagging.
9,12,7,JERRY,Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut?

9,12,12,JERRY,It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there.
9,12,12,ELAINE,"The cat is saying "" I've enjoyed reading your E-mail""."
9,12,12,GEORGE,Maybe it's got something to do with that 42 in the corner .
9,12,12,ELAINE,It's a page number.
9,12,12,GEORGE,"Well , I can't crack this one."
9,12,12,ELAINE,Aahh! this has got to be a mistake.

9,12,25,ALL,"Hey, Hey!"
9,12,25,KRAMER,And you must....look exactly like Jerry. You don't see this; you're like twins .. WOoooohhhhh!!!

9,12,26,GEORGE,"No..hummm , What do you know about what you look like."
9,12,26,KRAMER,C'mon George relax . Just because they look alike doesn't mean you're secretly in love with Jerry.

9,12,27,GEORGE,"Well,,, it's getting dark."
9,12,28,KRAMER,"yeah, she's a nice girl, kinda quiet though."

9,12,30,KRAMER,"Well how should I have ""broached the subject"""

9,12,30,KRAMER,Well sounds like someone's having a bad day.
9,12,30,JERRY,Yeah! Because of you.
9,12,30,KRAMER,"Well, I think one of us should leave."
9,12,31,JERRY,"Sally ,you can't quit the business. This is all because of me."
9,12,31,SALLY,Hehumm!!

9,12,40,JERRY,"What's happening? What, you doing , come and talk to us."
9,12,40,KRAMER,I've made an important life decision.
9,12,40,JERRY,Lets talk about that.
9,12,40,GEORGE,Don't leave
9,12,40,KRAMER,Aw right. I know I've been shooting off at the mouth lately; First with that girl whose life
9,12,41,GEORGE,What's the decision?
9,12,41,KRAMER,I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that's exactly what I'm going to do.

9,12,45,GEORGE,Silence YES!!
9,12,46,KRAMER,"Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal. Here watch."
9,12,47,JERRY,Well what does this mean?
9,12,47,KRAMER,Well it's Frank and Estelle's reaction of hearing George's man love towards she-Jerry.
9,12,47,GEORGE,
9,12,47,KRAMER,That's the idea.
9,12,47,JERRY,Kramer there's no way you stick to this.
9,12,47,KRAMER,..Weeeeeepp!!
9,12,47,JERRY,Oh! you just startin' now?
9,12,51,MR. ELINOFF,"So, J. Peterman wants to hire some of our cartoonists to illustrate your catalog?"
9,12,51,ELAINE,"Well we're hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a little funnier ,people"
9,12,53,MR. ELINOFF,Oh! yeah... That's a rather clever jab at inter office politics don't you think.
9,12,53,ELAINE,"Ahan, Ahan....yeah...Euh but, Why is it that the, that the animals enjoy reading the email?"
9,12,53,MR. ELINOFF,Well Miss Benes . Cartoons are like gossamer and one doesn't dissect gossamer. heh..hemm..
9,12,54,MR. ELINOFF,Ha! It's merely a commentary on contemporary mores.
9,12,54,ELAINE,"But, what is the comment."
9,12,54,MR. ELINOFF,It's a slice of life.
9,12,54,ELAINE,No it isn't.
9,12,54,MR. ELINOFF,Pun?
9,12,54,ELAINE,"I don,t think so."
9,12,54,MR ELINOFF,Vorshtein?
9,12,54,ELAINE,That's not a word.....You have no idea what this means do you?
9,12,54,MR ELINOFF,No.

9,12,65,JERRY,"Good luck , It's sold out for the next three weeks."
9,12,65,ELAINE,Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from ...The New Yorker.
9,12,65,JERRY,The New Yorker?
9,12,65,ELAINE,"Yes , The New Yorker , I've met with their cartoon editor and I got him to admit that that cartoon"
9,12,65,JERRY,"Wow! Good work, Nancy Drew"

9,12,65,JERRY,"What , your sad little horsies , the house with the little curl of smoke , the sunflower with the smiley"

9,12,66,JERRY,Where did you see that? Those are private!!!
9,12,67,SALLY,"Jerry , sorry I'm late. Channel Nine is doing a piece on my show. Isn't that great? Do you hate me?"
9,12,67,JERRY,"No ,no I tought the show was terrific. I was just wondering if you have to keep saying Jerry Seinfeld"
9,12,68,SALLY,Well...That is the title.
9,12,68,JERRY,I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I apologized then encouraged you to stick with it.
9,12,68,SALLY,You know I workshopped that and.. SNOOZERS!!! he he he....but I'll tell you what I'll think...
9,12,69,JERRY,You got a little shmootz there
9,12,70,NEWMAN,"Excuse me Miss Weaver , OH! My god it is you! I.. I've seen your show six times.."

9,12,80,ELAINE,"Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally came up with a great New Yorker cartoon."
9,12,80,JERRY,I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before I'd go out.
9,12,80,ELAINE,That is not the point.
9,12,80,JERRY,"some mouthwash , a hat , something."

9,12,80,ELAINE,Pretty good? Well uh! This is a gem . Kramer look it.........What?
9,12,81,JERRY,It's a pig at a complain department.
9,12,81,ELAINE,"And he's saying "" I wish I was taller"" ha ha. See? that's his complaint."
9,12,81,JERRY,I get it.
9,12,81,ELAINE,Do you!!!.. because that's not a normal complaint.
9,12,81,JERRY,"How 'bout if it was something like "" I can't find my receipt my place's a stye."

9,12,86,JERRY,....I'm getting a little tired of hearing how horrible I am and would appreciate it if you would leave
9,12,87,JERRY,That's it I'm calling in the big guns.
9,12,88,SALLY,"To cease and desist on behalf of my client, Jerry Seinfeld. Signed ; Crybaby Jerry Seinfeld's Lawyer."

9,12,100,GEORGE,....But after that we really talked didn't we?
9,12,100,JANET,"Well ,you told me how familiar I looked and that you must have seen me somewhere before."
9,12,100,GEORGE,Na....no ... This relationship he..he..has got to be about something and fast or I'm in very
9,12,101,JANET,You asked for a piece of gum because you thought your breath smelled like hummus.

9,12,109,GEORGE,Your hair?
9,12,109,JANET,Well I had to cut the gum out and I had a little trouble getting it even. So why don't you get undressed
9,12,110,GEORGE,George is in big trouble....
9,12,111,JERRY,You ripped off a Ziggy?
9,12,111,ELAINE,"It must've seeped up my subconscious , Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets....D'you read the comics today?"
