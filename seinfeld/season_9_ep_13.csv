9,13,0,THE STRONG BOX,Written by Dan O'Keefe & Billy Kimball
9,13,1,GEORGE,"I-I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sorry, but we, uh, we have to break up."
9,13,1,MAURA,No.
9,13,1,MAURA,We're not breaking up.
9,13,1,MAURA,No.
9,13,1,GEORGE,She said no.
9,13,1,JERRY,What did you do?
9,13,1,GEORGE,What could I do? We fooled around and went to a movie.
9,13,1,JERRY,"George, both parties don't have to consent to a breakup. It's not like you're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys. Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. Let me hear your arguments."
9,13,1,GEORGE,"Well, I don't really like her."
9,13,1,JERRY,That's good.
9,13,1,GEORGE,I don't find her attractive.
9,13,1,JERRY,Solid.
9,13,1,GEORGE,I'd like to sleep with a lot of other women.
9,13,1,JERRY,Always popular.
9,13,1,GEORGE,"Sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food. 'Oh, Mr. Mashed Potatoes, you are so good.'"
9,13,1,JERRY,You have an airtight case.
9,13,1,GEORGE,And in bed--
9,13,1,JERRY,I'm afraid we're out of time.
9,13,1,GEORGE,What?
9,13,1,JERRY,Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks that he actually wore in the movie Cinderfella. I got 'em at an auction.
9,13,1,GEORGE,I got some cufflinks I could've loaned you.
9,13,1,JERRY,"No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this Friar's Club roast I'm goin' to next week. Now I have an in to strike up a conversation with him."
9,13,1,GEORGE,You already have an in. You have the same first name. Jerry.
9,13,1,JERRY,"Oh, that'll intrigue him."
9,13,1,GEORGE,"Well, it worked when I met George Peppard last week."
9,13,1,JERRY,George Peppard has been dead for years.
9,13,1,GEORGE,"Well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about The A-Team."
9,13,2,ELAINE,"Right, right. I mean, if I was getting the chair, I'd go for something hot and spicy. You know, thai, maybe Mexican. Lethal injection, feels like pasta. You know, painless, don't want anything to heavy."
9,13,2,GLENN,"So, um, why don't we get together some time?"
9,13,2,ELAINE,"Oh, sure. Why don't you give me your number?"
9,13,2,GLENN,I think it'd be better if I called you.
9,13,2,ELAINE,Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. Do-do you work around here?
9,13,2,GLENN,"Mmmm... no, not really."
9,13,2,ELAINE,"So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself?"
9,13,2,GLENN,I think you're very beautiful.
9,13,2,"ELAINE, LAUGHING","Oh, ha ha. That'll do."
9,13,2,ELAINE,"I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks. I think it might be over."
9,13,2,JERRY,"So, what's this guy about?"
9,13,2,ELAINE,"I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked. I'll be he's in a relationship."
9,13,2,JERRY,"Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity. Elaine, you could be dating the Green Lantern!"
9,13,2,ELAINE,Which one is he?
9,13,2,JERRY,"Green suit, power ring."
9,13,2,ELAINE,I don't care for jewellery on men.
9,13,3,KRAMER,Hey. It happened again. Another robbery in the building.
9,13,3,JERRY,So you bought a cooler?
9,13,3,KRAMER,It's a strongbox to protect my irreplacables.
9,13,3,ELAINE,And... what would those be?
9,13,3,KRAMER,"Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations. My Tony, my... military discharge."
9,13,3,JERRY,You were in the Army?
9,13,3,KRAMER,"Briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions."
9,13,3,ELAINE,Literally.
9,13,3,KRAMER,'Literally'? What's that supposed to mean? You mind if I hide this somewhere?
9,13,3,JERRY,"No, go ahead."
9,13,3,JERRY,"Oh, come on!"
9,13,3,KRAMER,"Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue. Boy, you wouldn't last a day in the Army."
9,13,3,KRAMER,"Well, that's classified."
9,13,3,JERRY,Kramer?
9,13,3,ELAINE,"No, the Green Lantern."
9,13,3,ELAINE,"Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get."
9,13,4,KRAMER,You peeked!
9,13,4,JERRY,This is your hiding place?!
9,13,4,KRAMER,It was under a spoon!
9,13,5,MAURA,"No, George, we're not."
9,13,5,GEORGE,But I proved it!
9,13,5,MAURA,I refuse to give up on this relationship. It's like launching
9,13,6,GEORGE,"Well, then, I am gonna have to ask you to turn your key."
9,13,6,MAURA,"I'm sorry, George, I can't do that."
9,13,6,GEORGE,"Turn your key, Maura. Turn your key!"
9,13,7,GLENN,"Well, I might ask you the same thing."
9,13,7,"ELAINE, IN HER MIND","That's true, maybe he's not married."
9,13,8,ELAINE,"Oh, that is so sweet."
9,13,8,"ELAINE, IN HER MIND",How long do I have to hold this?
9,13,8,ELAINE,Who is it? me show you a short cut. Come on.
9,13,8,"ELAINE, IN HER MIND","Married. That's it, I'm chucking the flower."
9,13,8,ELAINE,You didn't hear me buzzing?
9,13,8,JERRY,"Oh, I guess it's broken."
9,13,8,ELAINE,Throw down your key.
9,13,8,JERRY,It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer.
9,13,8,ELAINE,I'll catch it!
9,13,8,JERRY,You'll chicken out at the last second.
9,13,8,ELAINE,"Yeah, you're right."
9,13,8,ELAINE,"All right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody"
9,13,9,JERRY,All right.
9,13,9,"JERRY, AFTER A PAUSE","Hey, you know what's weird?"
9,13,9,ELAINE,Huh?
9,13,9,JERRY,"I used to be able to have a huge meal, go right to sleep. But I can't"
9,13,10,ELAINE,Nodding off!
9,13,10,ELAINE,"Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife"
9,13,11,ELAINE,I'm hungry. Can you throw something down?
9,13,12,JERRY,You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!
9,13,12,KRAMER,"You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that"
9,13,14,KRAMER,What are you doing with her?
9,13,14,KRAMER,Security issue! in. guy.
9,13,14,JERRY,"So, he's definitely married, huh?"
9,13,14,ELAINE,Yeah...
9,13,14,JERRY,"Boy, I would've loved to have been there when you told him off."
9,13,14,ELAINE,Hmm...
9,13,14,JERRY,"Oh, come on!"
9,13,14,ELAINE,"Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen him run."
9,13,15,KRAMER,"All right, Jerry. Let's see if you can get it in your head that this"
9,13,16,JERRY,"George, the buzzer's broken! I'll come down!"
9,13,17,COAT POCKET,I believe this belongs to you.
9,13,17,KRAMER,Heyyyy!
9,13,18,GRANOLA BAR,Where did you get that?
9,13,18,GEORGE,I bought it.
9,13,18,PHIL,What?
9,13,18,JERRY,There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't let you in.
9,13,18,PHIL,"But, I live here. I ran out to get some birdseed, and-and I forgot my"
9,13,19,GEORGE,Sounds like a scam.
9,13,19,JERRY,"Great, you're lonely and miserable again."
9,13,19,GEORGE,Feels right.
9,13,19,JERRY,Is that guy still there?
9,13,19,JERRY,Don't look at him.
9,13,19,GEORGE,Want a bite?
9,13,19,JERRY,"No, I don't."
9,13,19,"GEORGE, IN HIS MIND",I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just Coke
9,13,20,GEORGE,"What? M-Maura, what are you doin' here? I ended this relationship,"
9,13,21,MAURA,"George, you didn't mean that. That was just a fight."
9,13,21,GEORGE,Why does it only seem like I'm the only one working at this breakup?
9,13,21,MAURA,"George, I listened to your arguments, and they were rambling and"
9,13,22,GEORGE,All right.
9,13,22,MAURA,"Eww, Mr. Apple. You have a brown spot."
9,13,23,GLENN,"It's nothing special, just a little place I keep."
9,13,23,ELAINE,Oh.
9,13,23,GLENN,"Ah, should I light a fire?"
9,13,23,ELAINE,"Oh, that sounds romantic. the heat. Uh, I got some cardboard out here."
9,13,23,"ELAINE, IN HER MIND",This is wrong. I should go.
9,13,23,"GLENN, FROM OUTSIDE","Can you get that, please?"
9,13,23,ELAINE,"Oh, sure. (Elaine gasps when she opens the door, seeing the woman from the street that"
9,13,24,LADY,Where's Glenn?
9,13,24,ELAINE,"You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. You know, I'm"
9,13,25,LADY,"Lady, I'm not his wife, I'm his welfare caseworker. Is he home?"
9,13,25,ELAINE,This is his home?
9,13,25,LADY,Yes.
9,13,25,ELAINE,"So, he's..."
9,13,25,LADY,Poor. will burn!
9,13,26,IN WITH HIM,So you do live here.
9,13,26,PHIL,Yeah.
9,13,26,PHIL,"Yeah. Jerry, seeing Phil start to open his apartment door, only one door down from"
9,13,26,KRAMER'S,So you live right... there.
9,13,26,PHIL,Yeah.
9,13,26,JERRY,So I guess I'll see--
9,13,27,JERRY,"Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels, with the"
9,13,28,ELAINE,He probably busted it up and burned it for heat.
9,13,28,JERRY,"So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?"
9,13,28,ELAINE,How can I end it over money? I feel bad.
9,13,28,JERRY,"Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other"
9,13,29,ELAINE,Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage
9,13,30,JERRY,Good. How did you handle that?
9,13,30,ELAINE,"Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley"
9,13,31,JERRY,"Same situation. Pay him off, and you're clean."
9,13,31,ELAINE,"Well, I am not paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship."
9,13,33,JERRY,"Hey, where have you been?"
9,13,33,GEORGE,"Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a"
9,13,34,ELAINE,"If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things"
9,13,35,GEORGE,"Who's this, Blue Arrow?"
9,13,35,ELAINE,Green Lantern.
9,13,35,JERRY,We found out his super power was lack of money.
9,13,35,ELAINE,All right.
9,13,35,JERRY,He's invulnerable to creditors.
9,13,35,ELAINE,We get it.
9,13,35,JERRY,He's the 'Got-no-Green' Lantern.
9,13,35,ELAINE,Thank you.
9,13,35,JERRY,"Hey, Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan."
9,13,35,"ELAINE, LEAVING",Well crafted.
9,13,35,GEORGE,"Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura."
9,13,35,JERRY,"Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair."
9,13,36,VACANT,"She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, I'll break"
9,13,37,JERRY,Could you move over there?
9,13,37,GEORGE,"Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work that always had a"
9,13,38,JERRY,Really? How come you never pursued her before?
9,13,38,GEORGE,"She's too tan. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot."
9,13,38,"JERRY, TO ELAINE",He can wipe out his checking account in a single bound!
9,13,40,KRAMER,Hey.
9,13,40,JERRY,There's a giant parrot in the hallway.
9,13,40,KRAMER,It's Phil's.
9,13,40,JERRY,Who?
9,13,40,KRAMER,"Our neighbor that you turned against. Anyway, I told him it'd be"
9,13,41,JERRY,What'd ya tell him that for?
9,13,41,KRAMER,"Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been"
9,13,43,JERRY,Really? What's it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where does he have the
9,13,44,KRAMER,"Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at"
9,13,45,JERRY,He let you?
9,13,45,KRAMER,"No, he doesn't know. So, uh, Phil won't be compulsively looking for"
9,13,48,LORETTA,I was in Maine for a couple days.
9,13,48,GEORGE,Well... here we are.
9,13,48,LORETTA,"George, I've always fantasized about jumping into bed with you."
9,13,48,GEORGE,Ho ho!
9,13,48,LORETTA,But... I don't want to spoil things by sleeping with you too soon.
9,13,48,GEORGE,Are you sure? 'Cause it could really help me out of a jam.
9,13,48,LORETTA,"I want to build something with you, George."
9,13,48,GEORGE,"Oh, not more building."
9,13,48,LORETTA,And I won't take no for an answer.
9,13,48,GEORGE,No?
9,13,48,LORETTA,No.
9,13,48,GLENN,It's a surprise.
9,13,48,"ELAINE, GIGGLING","Oh. (a nearby door opens, and a cook throws a garbage bag out into a trash can;"
9,13,49,ELAINE,What are you doing? What is that?
9,13,49,GLENN,It's a bag of donuts.
9,13,49,ELAINE,It's garbage. the old ones come out right here. your last name? idea how rare this is.
9,13,49,ELAINE,I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?
9,13,49,ELAINE,"Make it three hundred. the garbage can of my life. (the cook comes out again, dumping a bucket of water out in the alley, and"
9,13,52,JERRY,Phil... hi. I-I know we kind of got off to a bad start. But your
9,13,53,PHIL,And?
9,13,53,JERRY,"I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there."
9,13,53,PHIL,That's my wife.
9,13,55,GEORGE,This isn't going well.
9,13,55,JERRY,"I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without 'em, I have no in!"
9,13,56,JERRY,Where are you goin'? Help me look.
9,13,56,GEORGE,"It's a big night. I'm, uh, ice skating with one, and going to a"
9,13,57,JERRY,Which is with who?
9,13,57,"GEORGE, LEAVING",It doesn't matter. clean up nice.
9,13,57,JERRY,I can't go until I find my cufflinks.
9,13,57,KRAMER,"Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. That's why I took 'em out of"
9,13,58,JERRY,"You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please?"
9,13,60,KRAMER,"Hey, what's going on?"
9,13,60,PHIL,Fredo is dead.
9,13,60,JERRY,That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator?
9,13,60,PHIL,No! my bird. We just got back from the pet cemetery.
9,13,60,JERRY,"Oh, Phil. Mrs. Phil. I'm so sorry."
9,13,60,PHIL,"Oh, I'll bet you are! They told us he was poisoned! Something in his"
9,13,61,JERRY,"But I, I didn't--"
9,13,61,JERRY,"Kramer, they think I killed Fredo! And who buries a bird?"
9,13,61,KRAMER,"Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy, and he... puts it in the"
9,13,62,JERRY,Just get the key and let's get out here.
9,13,62,KRAMER,"You know, it's a funny thing about that bird dying. I hid the key in"
9,13,63,JERRY,Kramer!?
9,13,63,KRAMER,What?
9,13,63,JERRY,You killed Fredo!
9,13,63,KRAMER,Fredo was weak and stupid. He shouldn't've eaten that key.
9,13,63,JERRY,"Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box, and the"
9,13,64,KRAMER,You just answered your own question.
9,13,64,JERRY,"Oh, no."
9,13,65,LORETTA,What?
9,13,65,GEORGE,"I mean, uh... I had fun ice skating."
9,13,65,GEORGE,"Maura. Oh, my God! What are you doing here?!"
9,13,65,MAURA,You told me to meet you here for lunch.
9,13,65,"MAURA, TO LORETTA",I'm Maura.
9,13,65,"LORETTA, TO MAURA",I'm Loretta. You want to join us?
9,13,65,GEORGE,"This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend, and my"
9,13,67,MAURA,"George, what we have is too important. We can work through this."
9,13,67,LORETTA,So can we.
9,13,67,GEORGE,"What? So, this is still not over?"
9,13,67,MAURA,No.
9,13,67,GEORGE,You?
9,13,67,LORETTA,No.
9,13,67,ELAINE,"Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood, so you won't have to burn 'em."
9,13,67,ELAINE,Who is this?
9,13,67,ALLISON,His wife.
9,13,67,ELAINE,You're poor and married?
9,13,67,GLENN,Looks like it.
9,13,67,ALLISON,Who the hell are you?
9,13,67,ELAINE,I guess I'm Lois Loan.
9,13,68,KRAMER,"All right, then you're the one getting the key out of him."
9,13,68,KRAMER,"Listen, I heard that Lassie #3 is buried around here. I'm gonna go"
9,13,72,'MRS. PHIL',Oh!
9,13,72,JERRY,"Hey, neighbor."
9,13,73,"GEORGE, TO ELAINE",What do you think?
9,13,73,ELAINE,"Give me forty, you'll never see me again."
9,13,74,"ELAINE, TO JERRY","So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna live here, or are"
9,13,75,JERRY,"Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building."
9,13,75,KRAMER,"Oh. Well, would you look at that. Guess I forgot to lock it."
9,13,75,JERRY,You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery for something?
9,13,75,KRAMER,"Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry? Really one for the books."
