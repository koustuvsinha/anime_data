9,14,6,JERRY,Does it matter?
9,14,6,ELAINE,"No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know."
9,14,6,JERRY,"Oh, so you need to know?"
9,14,6,ELAINE,"No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew."

9,14,13,KRAMER,"Uh, you remember my coffee table book?"
9,14,13,JERRY,With the little legs?
9,14,13,KRAMER,That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so optioned it for a movie.

9,14,26,MORTY,Oooh! Heh heh! It's a radar detector.
9,14,26,JERRY,Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty miles an hour.
9,14,28,MORTY,This looks like too much money.
9,14,28,JERRY,"Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, fifty bucks."
9,14,28,MORTY,You think it's hot?
9,14,28,JERRY,Could be.
9,14,28,MORTY,"Attaboy! Helen, Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer!"
9,14,28,HELEN,I'm right here.
9,14,28,JERRY,"And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, fax, there's a"
9,14,29,MORTY,"So, I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the tip?"
9,14,29,JERRY,"Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner."
9,14,29,MORTY,"Helen, we got into restaurants and figure out the tips."
9,14,29,HELEN,"Jerry, you're getting your father too excited."
9,14,30,JERRY,"Kramer, what are you doing here?"
9,14,30,KRAMER,I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door.
9,14,30,HELEN,"Mr. Kornstein died, and it's a beautiful apartment."
9,14,30,KRAMER,"Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped on it."
9,14,30,JERRY,"Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die."
9,14,30,HELEN,Don't eat cookies for breakfast! I'll fix you something. How 'bout a

9,14,31,JERRY,"If you feed him, he'll never leave."
9,14,31,HELEN,We don't have any feta. How about cottage cheese and Egg Beaters?
9,14,31,"KRAMER, IMMATURELY",I guess.
9,14,31,JERRY,I can't believe this.
9,14,31,KRAMER,"I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed?"
9,14,32,GEORGE,"Actually, I did have a thought."
9,14,32,ELAINE,Oh.
9,14,32,GEORGE,Why don't you just ask him? like I really want to know.
9,14,32,GEORGE,"Maybe he's, um... mixed."
9,14,32,ELAINE,Is that the right word?
9,14,32,GEORGE,I really don't think we're supposed to be talkin' about this.

9,14,34,GEORGE,"Yeah, I may move out there. it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real!"
9,14,35,JERRY,"Dad, it's got lots of other functions."
9,14,35,MORTY,Don't worry. I'll get to the other functions.
9,14,36,HELEN,Yay! Jerry got it open.
9,14,36,MORTY,The service was slow. And God forbid they should refill the water.
9,14,37,MORTY,We'll round down.
9,14,37,HELEN,"Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here on your father's"
9,14,38,JERRY,"Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because you were"
9,14,39,MORTY,I was never impeached! I resigned!
9,14,39,HELEN,"Even so, the press would bury him!"
9,14,39,JERRY,What press?
9,14,39,HELEN,"The condo newsletter, the Boca Breeze."
9,14,39,MORTY,Pinko Commie rag.
9,14,40,JERRY,She's fifty.
9,14,40,OLD MAN,You know what he's got? He's got charisma. That's my man.
9,14,40,KRAMER,"All right, I'll see you guys."
9,14,40,OLD MAN,Yeah.
9,14,40,KRAMER,"Yeah. (Kramer, scanning the scene, is surprised to see Morty, right next to him,"
9,14,41,MORTY,I'll tell you what I'm looking at: the next condo president of Del
9,14,42,KRAMER,Hmm.
9,14,43,DARRYL,"Wow, it's got so many functions."
9,14,43,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is first. Warranty"
9,14,44,DARRYL,"Well, I don't do that stuff."
9,14,44,ELAINE,"It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Um. Oh,"
9,14,44,HERE'S ONE,race.
9,14,44,DARRYL,Isn't that optional?
9,14,44,ELAINE,It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! But they really
9,14,45,DARRYL,"All right, I'm... Asian."
9,14,45,ELAINE,What?
9,14,45,DARRYL,Just to mess with 'em.
9,14,45,ELAINE,laughing awkwardly: Oh. Right. Good one.
9,14,45,DARRYL,"Average income, uh... over a hundred thousand."
9,14,45,ELAINE,Really?
9,14,45,DARRYL,Does that matter?
9,14,45,ELAINE,"No, but... it is very nice to know."
9,14,46,ELAINE,"Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?"
9,14,46,JERRY,"Yeah, it's all my father's doing."
9,14,48,JERRY,He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power
9,14,49,ELAINE,"Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against?"
9,14,49,JERRY,Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair.
9,14,49,"ELAINE, TO GEORGE",He's still down with his folks.
9,14,49,"GEORGE, TO ELAINE",What are you doin' here?
9,14,49,"ELAINE, TO GEORGE",I'm gettin' his mail.
9,14,49,"GEORGE, TO ELAINE",He asked you to get the mail?
9,14,49,"ELAINE, TO GEORGE",Mm-hmm. mail?
9,14,49,JERRY,"George, listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you"
9,14,51,GEORGE,What about the mail?
9,14,51,JERRY,"This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, George."
9,14,51,"GEORGE, HANGING UP","All right, Jerry. I'll do it. See ya."
9,14,51,ELAINE,"Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you"
9,14,52,GEORGE,From me.
9,14,52,ELAINE,What did you say?
9,14,52,GEORGE,I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did you say?
9,14,52,ELAINE,I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed.
9,14,52,GEORGE,"So, they knew? Those liars!"
9,14,52,ELAINE,But you lied first.
9,14,52,GEORGE,"Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, they"
9,14,54,ELAINE,Like you're a liar!
9,14,54,GEORGE,Yes. Thank you! Is that so hard?
9,14,54,ELAINE,"So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over."
9,14,54,GEORGE,"Hmm-hmm, not by a long shot. I'm calling up the Rosses and inviting"
9,14,56,ELAINE,Haven't you done enough to these people?
9,14,56,GEORGE,"This is not about them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to exercise"
9,14,57,"KRAMER, TO A ROOM",Vote for Kramer. I'd like your vote. Thanks. Kramer.
9,14,57,OLD WOMAN,Will you cut my meat?
9,14,57,KRAMER,Gladly.
9,14,57,DARRYL,Sure.
9,14,57,"WAITRESS, TO DARRYL",Are you black? Or should I bring some cream.
9,14,57,DARRYL,I'm black.
9,14,57,"DARRYL, RE-THINKING","Oh, you know what? Bring a little cream."
9,14,57,ELAINE,What?
9,14,57,DARRYL,"God, there are still people who have trouble with an interracial"
9,14,58,ELAINE,Interracial? Us?
9,14,58,DARRYL,Isn't that unbelievable!?
9,14,58,ELAINE,"Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial couple."
9,14,59,DARRYL,I don't feel like eating.
9,14,59,ELAINE,"Me neither. Well, maybe this turkey club."
9,14,59,GEORGE,So... here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons.
9,14,59,MRS. ROSS,Sounds grand.
9,14,59,GEORGE,Do you have your bathing suits?
9,14,59,MR. ROSS,It's March.
9,14,59,GEORGE,"Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons. It's a two-hour drive."
9,14,63,KRAMER,"Oh, no. We're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, one... must"
9,14,64,KRAMER,"Right. Yeah. The polls close after dinner, three o'clock. But then"
9,14,65,JERRY,"You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily"
9,14,66,MORTY,Daily what? clubhouse.
9,14,66,MORTY,Barefoot in the clubhouse? Don't you realize this is against the
9,14,67,KRAMER,"Well, I couldn't find my shoes."
9,14,67,JERRY,"Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives to move down"
9,14,68,HELEN,Who wants hot chocolate?
9,14,68,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah! Me."
9,14,68,MORTY,This is a huge scandal! We need damage control.
9,14,68,KRAMER,"All right, look. People seem to like those tip calculators, huh?"
9,14,68,JERRY,Wizards!
9,14,68,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out to every member on the"
9,14,69,JERRY,Kramer...
9,14,69,MORTY,There are twenty people on the board. Thank God you can get that
9,14,70,KRAMER,"Payoffs. Now we're playin' politics. All right, what do we next,"
9,14,71,JERRY,"Kramer, I can't get that many Wizards."
9,14,71,KRAMER,"Well, what about your deal, huh?"
9,14,71,JERRY,I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a pop. What do I
9,14,72,KRAMER,"Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy."
9,14,72,JERRY,Down here?
9,14,72,KRAMER,"Yeah, Bob Saccamano's father."
9,14,73,MRS. ROSS,Tell us more.
9,14,73,GEORGE,You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into the solarium.
9,14,73,MR. ROSS,Another solarium?
9,14,73,GEORGE,"Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, too?"
9,14,73,MR. ROSS,What are their names?
9,14,73,GEORGE,Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving?
9,14,73,MRS. ROSS,"Oh, look, an antique stand. Pull over. We'll buy you a"
9,14,74,WAITRESS,"Yeah, I just worked a triple shift."
9,14,74,ELAINE,"I hear ya, Sister."
9,14,74,WAITRESS,Sister? Here he is. See?
9,14,74,DARRYL,"Hi, Elaine."
9,14,74,ELAINE,Hey.
9,14,74,WAITRESS,He's black?
9,14,74,ELAINE,Yeah.
9,14,74,DARRYL,I'm black?
9,14,74,ELAINE,Aren't you?
9,14,74,"WAITRESS, LEAVING",I'll give you a couple minutes to decide.
9,14,74,DARRYL,What are you talking about?
9,14,74,ELAINE,You're black. You said we were an interracial couple.
9,14,74,DARRYL,We are. Because you're Hispanic.
9,14,74,ELAINE,I am?
9,14,74,DARRYL,Aren't you?
9,14,74,ELAINE,No. Why would you think that?
9,14,74,DARRYL,"Your name's Benes, your hair, and you kept taking me to those"
9,14,75,ELAINE,That's because I thought you were black.
9,14,75,DARRYL,Why would you take me to a Spanish restaurant because I'm black?
9,14,75,ELAINE,I don't think we should be talking about this.
9,14,75,DARRYL,"So, what are you?"
9,14,75,ELAINE,I'm white.
9,14,75,DARRYL,"So, we're just a couple of white people?"
9,14,75,ELAINE,I guess.
9,14,75,DARRYL,Oh.
9,14,75,ELAINE,Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?
9,14,78,JERRY,Aw.
9,14,78,MORTY,"Congratulations, Mr. President."
9,14,78,KRAMER,"Congratulations, Mr. Puppet Master."
9,14,78,OLD MAN,"Hey, Morty, what's wrong with these tip calculators?"
9,14,78,MORTY,What are you talking about?
9,14,78,OLD MAN,It's overtipping. I just left five bucks for a BLT.
9,14,78,MORTY,"This isn't a Wizard, it's a Willard."
9,14,78,JERRY,"A Willard? Saccamano, Sr. screwed me!"
9,14,78,OLD MAN #2,Mine doesn't have a seven!
9,14,78,OLD MAN #3,I'm ruined!
9,14,78,MORTY,"Jerry, why didn't you get them Wizards?"
9,14,78,JERRY,Because a real Wizard's two hundred dollars.
9,14,78,MORTY,You didn't have a deal?
9,14,78,JERRY,No deal. Not hot.
9,14,78,OLD MAN,"Morty, you, and Kramer, you're finished."
9,14,78,KRAMER,What?
9,14,78,OLD MAN,Everyone vote for the guy in the wheelchair.
9,14,79,JERRY,"Dad, I'm sorry."
9,14,79,MORTY,You should be! How could you spend two hundred dollars on a tip
9,14,80,JERRY,It does other things!
9,14,80,GEORGE,Almost there.
9,14,80,MR. ROSS,"Well, this is the end of Long Island. Where's your house?"
9,14,80,GEORGE,"We, uh, we go on foot from here."
9,14,80,MR. ROSS,All right.
9,14,80,GEORGE,There's no house! It's a lie! There's no solarium. There's no
9,14,81,MR. ROSS,We know.
9,14,81,GEORGE,"Then, why? Why did you make me drive all the way out here? Why"
9,14,82,MRS. ROSS,"We don't like you, George."
9,14,82,MR. ROSS,And we always blamed you for what happened to Susan.
9,14,82,GEORGE,Oh.
9,14,82,MR. ROSS,All right! Let's head back.
