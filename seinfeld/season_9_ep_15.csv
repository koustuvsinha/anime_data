9,15,2,PUDDY,"Alright, be careful with the car, babe."
9,15,2,ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah."
9,15,2,PUDDY,"And don't move the seat, I got it right where I like it."
9,15,2,ELAINE,Goodbye?
9,15,2,PUDDY,"Two and ten, babe."
9,15,2,ELAINE,Okay.
9,15,2,PUDDY,Don't peel out.
9,15,2,ELAINE,I won't.
9,15,6,ELAINE,Jesus?
9,15,7,KRUGER,"According to our latest quarterly thing,Kruger Industrial Smoothing is"
9,15,8,GEORGE,"Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off my rent"
9,15,9,KRUGER,"Works for me. Good thinking, George."
9,15,9,CO-WORKER 1,"Alright, George."
9,15,9,CO-WORKER 2,Way to go man.
9,15,9,GEORGE,"Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend"
9,15,10,KRUGER,"Are you done? Silly voices, c'mon people, let's get real."
9,15,10,CO-WORKER 1,Good one.
9,15,10,CO-WORKER 2,That was bad.
9,15,11,GEORGE,"I had 'em, Jerry. They loved me."
9,15,11,JERRY,And then?
9,15,11,GEORGE,I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a
9,15,12,JERRY,"Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight and"
9,15,13,GEORGE,I can't just leave.
9,15,13,JERRY,That's the way they do it in Vegas.
9,15,13,GEORGE,You never played Vegas.
9,15,13,JERRY,I hear things.
9,15,14,ELAINE,Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his radio
9,15,15,GEORGE,I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those real
9,15,16,ELAINE,"So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?"
9,15,16,JERRY,"It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets."
9,15,16,ELAINE,"Yes, he is lazy."
9,15,16,JERRY,Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.
9,15,16,ELAINE,"Yes, he is dumb."
9,15,16,JERRY,So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?
9,15,16,ELAINE,"Dumb and lazy, I understand."
9,15,16,GEORGE,Tell you how you could check.
9,15,16,ELAINE,How?
9,15,16,GEORGE,"Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? The"
9,15,17,JERRY,"No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it"
9,15,18,GEORGE,"No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you."
9,15,18,JERRY,"Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio"
9,15,19,GEORGE,Well that's the gist of it!
9,15,19,ELAINE,Quiet! So where is this Sophie?
9,15,19,JERRY,"Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes."
9,15,19,ELAINE,How long have you two been together?
9,15,19,JERRY,"I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?"
9,15,19,ELAINE AND GEORGE,Nah.
9,15,20,GEORGE,"By the way, how did Puddy get back in the picture?"
9,15,20,ELAINE,I needed to move a bureau.
9,15,21,KRAMER,"Hey Jerry, you got any pepper?"
9,15,21,MICKEY,Hey Jerry.
9,15,21,JERRY,Hey Mickey. Check the pepper shaker.
9,15,21,KRAMER,Yeah. See? It should
9,15,22,MICKEY,Aah-choo.
9,15,22,KRAMER,"A little wetter. See, I didn't believe it."
9,15,22,JERRY,What's with the fake sneezing?
9,15,22,KRAMER,"Yeah, we're going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital, See they hire actors to"
9,15,23,MICKEY,They assign you a specific disease and you act out the symptoms. It's
9,15,24,JERRY,Do medical schools actually do this?
9,15,24,KRAMER,"Well the better ones. Alright, let's practice retching."
9,15,24,JERRY,I think the phone is ringing.
9,15,24,JERRY,"Would you hold it a second?! Thank you, will you get out of here with"
9,15,25,KRAMER,"Mickey, DTs."
9,15,26,JERRY,Hello?
9,15,26,SOPHIE,Hey. It's me.
9,15,26,JERRY,Elaine?
9,15,26,SOPHIE,"No, it's me."
9,15,26,JERRY,George??
9,15,26,SOPHIE,"Jerry, it's Sophie. I can't believe you don't recognize my voice."
9,15,26,JERRY,"Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian."
9,15,27,KRAMER,You got any Ipecac?
9,15,27,JERRY,"Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with this."
9,15,27,KRAMER,"No, Mickey, he swallowed twelve aspirin."
9,15,27,JERRY,Did he overdose?
9,15,27,KRAMER,"No, it's just too much."
9,15,28,KRUGER,...And it gets worse. The team working on the statue in Lafayette
9,15,30,GEORGE,"Alright, well why don't we smooth the head down to nothing, stick a"
9,15,32,GEORGE,Alright! That's it for me. Goodnight
9,15,35,DR. WEXLER,In your packet you will find the disease you have been assigned and
9,15,36,MICKEY,Bacterial Meningitis. Jackpot!
9,15,36,KRAMER,Gonorrhea? You wanna trade?
9,15,36,MICKEY,"Sorry buddy, this is the ""Hamlet"" of diseases. Severe pain, nausea,"
9,15,37,KRAMER,"Howbout you, do you wanna trade?"
9,15,37,MAN,Sure.
9,15,37,KRAMER,"Okay, what do you got?"
9,15,37,MAN,The surgeon left a sponge inside me.
9,15,37,KRAMER,Good luck with that.
9,15,38,GEORGE,I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was gone.
9,15,38,JERRY,What did you do the rest of the day?
9,15,38,GEORGE,"I saw ""Titanic"". So that old woman, she's just a liar, right?"
9,15,38,JERRY,And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.
9,15,39,ELAINE,Hello boys.
9,15,39,GEORGE,"Hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo?"
9,15,39,ELAINE,I did.
9,15,39,GEORGE,And the Christian rock?
9,15,39,ELAINE,"Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus fish!"
9,15,39,GEORGE,"Jerry, do you have any fishsticks?"
9,15,39,JERRY,No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?
9,15,39,ELAINE,"Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel"
9,15,40,GEORGE,I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore.
9,15,40,JERRY,"I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the ""It's me"" on the phone today."
9,15,40,ELAINE,"""It's me?"" Isn't it a little premature?"
9,15,40,JERRY,I thought so.
9,15,40,ELAINE,"Hah. She's not a ""me"". I'm a ""me""."
9,15,40,GEORGE,"I'm against all ""it's me""s. So self-absorbed and egotistical, it's"
9,15,42,KRAMER,"Well, I got gonorrhea."
9,15,42,ELAINE,That seems about right.
9,15,42,KRAMER,That's what they gave me.
9,15,42,GEORGE,They? The Government?
9,15,42,JERRY,"No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose"
9,15,43,KRAMER,"And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, he"
9,15,44,GEORGE,"I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors."
9,15,45,GEORGE,Alright that's it for me. Good night everybody.
9,15,45,ELAINE,What was that?
9,15,45,JERRY,"Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note."
9,15,45,KRAMER,"See, showmanship. Maybe that's what my gonorrhea is missing."
9,15,45,JERRY,Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back
9,15,46,KRAMER,"Yes, yes I will! I'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, and feel the"
9,15,48,STUDENT #1,And are you experiencing any discomfort?
9,15,48,KRAMER,Just a little burning during urination.
9,15,48,STUDENT #1,"Okay, any other pain?"
9,15,48,KRAMER,The haunting memories of lost love. May I?
9,15,53,STUDENT #1,Gonorrhea?!
9,15,53,KRAMER,Gonorrhea!
9,15,57,JERRY,One message. Hope it's not from you.
9,15,57,ANSWERING MACHINE,"""Hey Jerry, it's me. Call me back."""
9,15,57,JERRY,Sophie.
9,15,57,GEORGE,She's still doing that?
9,15,57,JERRY,Yep.
9,15,57,GEORGE,"Alright, I'll tell you what you do. You call her back and give her the"
9,15,58,JERRY,"I think that's a ""what's good for the goose is good for the gander""."
9,15,58,GEORGE,"What the hell is a gander, anyway?"
9,15,58,JERRY,"It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me."
9,15,58,SOPHIE,Hey Raef.
9,15,58,JERRY,She thinks it's someone named Raef.
9,15,58,GEORGE,"Good, let her think it."
9,15,58,JERRY,"So, what's going on?"
9,15,58,SOPHIE,Not a lot.
9,15,58,GEORGE,"Ask about you, ask about you."
9,15,58,JERRY,"So, uh, how are things with Jerry?"
9,15,58,SOPHIE,"Oh, I really like him but, well, I still haven't told him the tractor"
9,15,59,JERRY,"Right, right, the tractor story."
9,15,59,SOPHIE,"Are you sick, Raef? You sound kinda funny."
9,15,59,JERRY,I sound funny?
9,15,59,GEORGE,Abort! Abort!
9,15,59,JERRY,"Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye. That was close! What"
9,15,60,GEORGE,That was very real.
9,15,60,JERRY,She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.
9,15,60,GEORGE,"Woah, back it up, back it up. Beep, beep, beep. Tractor story?"
9,15,60,JERRY,"Beep, beep, beep? What are you doing?"
9,15,61,ELAINE,So where do you wanna eat?
9,15,61,PUDDY,Feels like an Arby's night.
9,15,61,ELAINE,Arby's. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god?
9,15,61,PUDDY,Yes.
9,15,61,ELAINE,"Oh. So, you're pretty religious?"
9,15,61,PUDDY,That's right.
9,15,61,ELAINE,So is it a problem that I'm not really religious?
9,15,61,PUDDY,Not for me.
9,15,61,ELAINE,Why not?
9,15,61,PUDDY,I'm not the one going to hell.
9,15,62,GEORGE,You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor.
9,15,62,JERRY,"No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're"
9,15,63,GEORGE,Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need?
9,15,63,JERRY,"No, she looks completely normal."
9,15,63,GEORGE,"Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor"
9,15,64,JERRY,You think she's got toes for thumbs?
9,15,64,GEORGE,"How's her handshake? A little firm, isn't it? Maybe a little too"
9,15,65,JERRY,I don't know.
9,15,65,GEORGE,Hands a little smelly?
9,15,65,JERRY,Why do I seek your counsel?
9,15,66,ELAINE,Well I'm going to hell.
9,15,66,JERRY,That seems about right.
9,15,66,ELAINE,According to Puddy.
9,15,66,JERRY,"Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and"
9,15,67,ELAINE,I'm not in the mood.
9,15,67,GEORGE,I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.
9,15,67,JERRY,What do you care? You don't believe in hell.
9,15,67,ELAINE,"I know, but he does."
9,15,67,JERRY,So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of
9,15,68,ELAINE,"Well, relationships are very important to me."
9,15,68,JERRY,Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for
9,15,69,GEORGE,And a slice of devil's food cake.
9,15,70,GEORGE,Hey. Where is everyone?
9,15,70,MR. KRUGER,"They're all off the project. They were boring. George, you are my"
9,15,71,GEORGE,I am?
9,15,71,MR. KRUGER,"I don't know what it is, I can't put my finger on it, but lately"
9,15,72,GEORGE,This is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and
9,15,73,MR. KRUGER,"Ah, I'm not too worried about it. Let's get started."
9,15,73,GEORGE,Okay.
9,15,73,MR. KRUGER,George? Check it out.
9,15,74,GEORGE,And?
9,15,74,MR. KRUGER,All me.
9,15,75,DR. WEXLER,"Alright, and here are you ailments for this week. By the way, Mr."
9,15,76,KRAMER,"Oh, thank you."
9,15,76,MICKEY,Cirrhosis of the liver with jaundice! Alright I get to wear make-up!
9,15,77,KRAMER,"Gonorrhea? Excuse me, I think there's been a mistake, see, I had"
9,15,78,DR. WEXLER,"Oh, it's no mistake. We loved what you did with it."
9,15,78,KRAMER,"I don't believe this, I'm being typecast."
9,15,79,SOPHIE,I move my knight... here. Check.
9,15,79,JERRY,"They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe"
9,15,80,SOPHIE,"Jerry, are you embarrassed that you're losing?"
9,15,80,JERRY,"Losing? You know, yesterday I lost control of my car, almost bought the"
9,15,81,SOPHIE,Bought the farm?
9,15,81,JERRY,Tractor!
9,15,81,SOPHIE,"This is an odd side of you, Jerry. I feel uncomfortable."
9,15,81,JERRY,"Wait, don't go. Let's thumb wrestle."
9,15,84,GEORGE,A scar?
9,15,84,JERRY,A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...?
9,15,84,GEORGE,A tractor.
9,15,84,JERRY,I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about
9,15,85,GEORGE,I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her toe
9,15,86,JERRY,She doesn't have toe thumbs.
9,15,86,GEORGE,"Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor--"
9,15,86,JERRY,Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?
9,15,86,GEORGE,Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for
9,15,92,MR. KRUGER,I'm not too worried about it.
9,15,92,GEORGE,Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I put in
9,15,93,MR. KRUGER,"Alright, alright I'm going."
9,15,93,GEORGE,Huh-ho! Have you ever seen anything like this?
9,15,93,JERRY,Never.
9,15,95,PUDDY,"Elaine, they forgot to deliver your paper today. Why don't you just"
9,15,96,ELAINE,"'Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy, that's his."
9,15,96,PUDDY,"C'mon, get it."
9,15,96,ELAINE,"Well if you want it, you get it."
9,15,96,PUDDY,"Sorry, thou shalt not steal."
9,15,96,ELAINE,"Oh, but it's ok for me?"
9,15,96,PUDDY,"What do you care, you know where you're going."
9,15,96,ELAINE,"Alright, that is it! I can't live like this."
9,15,96,PUDDY,Nah.
9,15,96,ELAINE,C'mon.
9,15,96,PUDDY,"Alright, what did I do?"
9,15,96,ELAINE,"David, I'm going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils"
9,15,98,PUDDY,Gonna be rough.
9,15,98,ELAINE,"Uh, you should be trying to save me!"
9,15,98,PUDDY,Don't boss me! This is why you're going to hell.
9,15,98,ELAINE,"I am not going to hell and if you think I'm going to hell, you should"
9,15,99,PUDDY,"You stole my Jesus fish, didn't you?"
9,15,99,ELAINE,"Yeah, that's right!"
9,15,102,MICKEY,"Oh, my liver! Why did I drink all those years? Why did I look for"
9,15,103,DR. WEXLER,Mr. Kramer? You're up.
9,15,104,MICKEY,"Wait a minute. You are doing gonorrhea, aren't you?"
9,15,104,KRAMER,"Well, we'll see."
9,15,104,STUDENT #2,"So, what seems to be bothering you today, Mr. Kramer?"
9,15,104,KRAMER,"Well, I guess it started about twenty years ago when I got back from Viet Nam, and this was the"
9,15,105,MICKEY,Hey! That's my cirrhosis! He's stealing my cirrhosis! (he jumps
9,15,107,STUDENT #2,Cirrhosis of the liver and PCP addiction?
9,15,108,FATHER CURTIS,Let me see if I understand this. You're concerned that he isn't
9,15,109,ELAINE AND PUDDY,"Yeah, that's right."
9,15,109,FATHER CURTIS,"Well, oftentimes in cases of inter-faith marriages, couples have"
9,15,110,ELAINE,"Woah, woah, woah! No one's getting married here."
9,15,110,FATHER CURTIS,You aren't?
9,15,110,PUDDY,No.
9,15,110,ELAINE,"We're just, you know, having a good time."
9,15,110,FATHER CURTIS,"Oh, well then it's simple. You're both going to hell."
9,15,110,PUDDY,"No way, this is bogus, man!"
9,15,110,ELAINE,"Well, thank you father."
9,15,110,FATHER CURTIS,"Oh, did you hear the one about the new guy in hell who's talkng"
9,15,111,PUDDY,"I'm really not in the mood, I'm going to hell."
9,15,111,ELAINE,"Oh, lighten up. It'll only feel like an eternity."
9,15,114,SOPHIE,"You know, Jerry, there's this thing that I haven't told you about."
9,15,115,JERRY,"Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with it."
9,15,115,SOPHIE,How could you know?
9,15,116,SOPIE'S),Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not
9,15,119,KRAMER,
9,15,119,MICKEY,"You gave me gonorrhea, you didn't even tell me!"
9,15,119,KRAMER,"Well, I'm sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd have fun"
9,15,120,JERRY,"Hey, hey! I'm with someone."
9,15,120,KRAMER,Oh. Hello.
9,15,120,SOPHIE,"No, I understand. This could be a tough thing to deal with. The"
9,15,121,KRAMER,You know? She's right.
9,15,121,SOPHIE,"Unfortunately, I didn't have a partner. I got gonorrhea from a"
9,15,122,JERRY,You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor
9,15,123,KRAMER,You can't get it from that.
9,15,123,SOPHIE,But I did. My boyfriend said I got gonorrhea from riding the tractor
9,15,124,JERRY,"Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight"
9,15,128,GEORGE,Would you mind helping me out with some of this stuff?!?
9,15,128,MR. KRUGER,You seem like you've got a pretty good handle on it.
9,15,128,GEORGE,No! I don't! Don't you even care? This is your company! It's your
9,15,130,MR. KRUGER,"K-uger, that sounds like one of those old-time car horns, huh?"
9,15,131,GEORGE,"Huh-ho! Oh! You are too much, Mr. Kruger! Too much!"
9,15,131,MR. KRUGER,"Thank you George, you've been great. That's"
9,15,132,GEORGE,"Oh no, you're not going out on a high note with me Mr. Kruger!"
9,15,132,MR. KRUGER,It's K-uger!
9,15,132,GEORGE,No! No!
9,15,132,MR. KRUGER,Goodnight everybody!
