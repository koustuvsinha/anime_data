9,18,0,THE MAID,"Written by Alec Berg, Jeff Schaffer, David Mandel, Kit Boss & Peter Mehlman"
9,18,1,JERRY,Cup of tea with lemon.
9,18,1,GEORGE,What happened to your voice?
9,18,1,JERRY,I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open for a rodeo.
9,18,1,GEORGE,"Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can go with George Costanza."
9,18,1,JERRY,Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?
9,18,1,GEORGE,"The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up."
9,18,1,JERRY,You mean like...Liza!
9,18,1,GEORGE,But I was thinking...T-bone.
9,18,1,JERRY,"But there's no ""t"" in your name. What about G-bone?"
9,18,1,GEORGE,There's no G-bone.
9,18,1,JERRY,There's a g-spot.
9,18,1,GEORGE,That's a myth.
9,18,2,JERRY,"T-bone, the ladies are gonna love ya."
9,18,2,ELAINE,Why did they hire you for a rodeo?
9,18,3,JERRY,They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once.
9,18,3,ELAINE,Didn't he throw you off a bus in the middle of Alabama or--
9,18,3,JERRY,"Oh, I had that comin' to me."
9,18,3,ELAINE,"You know, Kenny Rogers has a-"
9,18,4,ELAINE,Why did you get a maid?
9,18,4,JERRY,You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid.
9,18,4,ELAINE,Where did you get her?
9,18,4,JERRY,I hired her from a service!
9,18,4,MAID,All done.
9,18,4,JERRY,Thank you. Nice job.
9,18,4,MAID,Is this mine?
9,18,4,JERRY,Yeah.
9,18,5,JERRY,What?
9,18,5,ELAINE,"Come on, Jerry. You didn't notice?"
9,18,5,JERRY,Notice what? She's not really even a maid.
9,18,5,ELAINE,Oh.
9,18,5,JERRY,"She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or a...news woman."
9,18,5,ELAINE,Uh-huh. News woman. Yeah.
9,18,6,KRAMER,"Hey. Well, bad news, boys. My life is over. My girlfriend's movin' away."
9,18,6,JERRY,You have a girlfriend?
9,18,7,KRAMER,"Jerry, where have you been?"
9,18,7,JERRY,At a rodeo. Where's she moving?
9,18,7,KRAMER,Downtown.
9,18,7,ELAINE,Downtown New York?
9,18,7,KRAMER,Yeah. I don't know if I can handle one of these long-distance relationships.
9,18,7,JERRY,It's like 10 minutes by subway.
9,18,7,KRAMER,I don't know.
9,18,8,KRAMER,"Oh! Jeez! Well, you've got a maid. It's a whole different world downtown-- different Gap, different Tower Records, and she's a 646."
9,18,8,ELAINE,What? What is that?
9,18,8,JERRY,"That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646."
9,18,8,ELAINE,I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.
9,18,8,KRAMER,"Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later and pick up a fax."
9,18,8,ELAINE,At work?
9,18,8,KRAMER,No. At your apartment.
9,18,8,ELAINE,I don't have a fax machine.
9,18,8,JERRY,Here we go.
9,18,8,KRAMER,"Well, now what are we gonna do? See? This is why you should get a fax and a Xerox."
9,18,8,JERRY,And a dead bolt.
9,18,9,ELAINE,Then maybe you have a fax machine.
9,18,9,KRAMER,You just blew my mind.
9,18,9,KRUGER,Let's order lunch.
9,18,10,KRUGER,"Mary, I will have a chef's salad."
9,18,10,MALE WORKER,Turkey sandwich.
9,18,10,GEORGE,T-bone steak.
9,18,10,KRUGER,For lunch?
9,18,10,GEORGE,"Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. Love that T-bone. In fact, you might as well call me--"
9,18,10,WATKINS,"That sounds good. I'll have one, too."
9,18,10,KRUGER,"Watkins, you're havin' a T-bone?"
9,18,10,WATKINS,I love 'em.
9,18,10,KRUGER,"Well, then we should call you T-bone."
9,18,10,GEORGE,"Uh, no. No, we shouldn't."
9,18,10,KRUGER,T-bone!
9,18,10,ALL,T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone!
9,18,11,ELAINE,Hello?
9,18,12,ELAINE,What?
9,18,13,MACHINE,You have 57 messages. Message one...
9,18,14,MACHINE,Message two...
9,18,15,MACHINE,Message three...
9,18,15,GEORGE,"Hey, it's George. Listen, I-"
9,18,16,MACHINE,Message four...
9,18,19,EALINE,Hello?
9,18,20,ELAINE,Aah!
9,18,20,JERRY,"Well Cindy, the place looks great."
9,18,21,CINDY,"Thanks Jerry, gotta run."
9,18,21,JERRY,"Ok, I'll see ya."
9,18,22,CINDY,"Hi, Elaine."
9,18,23,ELAINE,All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is a wise decision.
9,18,23,JERRY,"Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation so obviously fraught with potential complications?"
9,18,23,ELAINE,You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep with you.
9,18,23,JERRY,No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--
9,18,23,ELAINE,What? A health plan?
9,18,23,JERRY,"I was going to say, ""Being a good host."""
9,18,23,ELAINE,Oh-ho-ho. Oh.
9,18,23,JERRY,"But the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some what sophisticated."
9,18,23,ELAINE,So you consider this a relationship?
9,18,23,JERRY,"Yes, I do."
9,18,23,ELAINE,Oh. Have you been out?
9,18,23,JERRY,"Yes, we have."
9,18,23,ELAINE,Where did you go?
9,18,23,JERRY,The store.
9,18,23,ELAINE,Mm! To get what?
9,18,23,JERRY,Stuff.
9,18,23,ELAINE,Cleaning supplies?
9,18,23,JERRY,And gum.
9,18,23,ELAINE,"Oh. Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin' the maid and then chewin' some gum."
9,18,23,JERRY,She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!
9,18,24,KRAMER,"Hey. Well, I just saw Madeline off. Yeah. She's in a cab and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. I miss her already."
9,18,25,ELAINE,"Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house every 30 seconds?"
9,18,25,KRAMER,"Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the menus from some restaurants."
9,18,25,ELAINE,Which ones?
9,18,25,KRAMER,"Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package."
9,18,25,ELAINE,So this is never gonna stop?
9,18,25,KRAMER,"Well, it better not. Paid for the whole year. So, should I pick those up later?"
9,18,25,ELAINE,You can pick 'em up right now.
9,18,26,KRAMER,Ah!
9,18,27,ELAINE,I wonder if anyone knows he's here. If he just disappeared...would anybody notice?
9,18,27,PHONE MAN,"All right, miss Benes, all finished. Here's your new number."
9,18,27,ELAINE,Ahem. 646? What is this?
9,18,27,PHONE MAN,That's your new area code.
9,18,27,ELAINE,I thought 646 was just for new numbers.
9,18,27,PHONE MAN,This is a new number.
9,18,27,ELAINE,"No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed."
9,18,27,PHONE MAN,"Look, I work for the phone company. I've had a lot of experience with semantics, so don't try to lure me into some maze of circular logic."
9,18,27,ELAINE,"You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known."
9,18,27,PHONE MAN,"I could've killed you, and no one would've known."
9,18,27,JERRY,"Kramer, you're still on the phone?"
9,18,28,KRAMER,"Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. Jerry, you know this comes on at the same time here as it does there?"
9,18,28,JERRY,Really? It's Tuesday here. What day is it there?
9,18,28,KRAMER,"Jerry's teasing. Uh-oh! Commercial. Oh, you going to the bathroom? Yeah. I'll go, too."
9,18,29,JERRY,Madeline stays here.
9,18,30,JERRY,"Hey, T-bone!"
9,18,30,GEORGE,No. No T-bone.
9,18,30,JERRY,No T-bone?
9,18,30,KRAMER,"Hey, is that T-bone?!"
9,18,30,JERRY,No! There's no T-bone!
9,18,30,KRAMER,"Well, why no T-bone?!"
9,18,30,JERRY,Why no T-bone?
9,18,30,GEORGE,'Cause Neil Watkins from accounting is T-bone!
9,18,31,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah I'm back. Hey, you wanna play cards over the phone?"
9,18,32,KRAMER,"Oh, hey, uh, listen, Jerry, uh, laundry's pilin' up there. You might want to tell your girlfriend. Mmm. Yeah."
9,18,33,GEORGE,Your girlfriend is doin' your laundry?
9,18,33,KRAMER,He's sleeping with his maid!
9,18,33,GEORGE,You're sleepin' with the maid?
9,18,33,JERRY,Yes.
9,18,33,GEORGE,I've done that. Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?
9,18,33,JERRY,No.
9,18,34,MAN,You're probably one of those women who doesn't like to give out her number.
9,18,34,ELAINE,"No, I'm not. Here you go."
9,18,34,ELAINE,It's a new area code.
9,18,34,MAN,What area? New Jersey?
9,18,34,ELAINE,"No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212. They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle number. It's the same."
9,18,34,MAN,Do I have to dial a one first?
9,18,35,MAN,I'm really kinda seein' somebody.
9,18,35,ELAINE,"Yeah? Well, so am I!"
9,18,35,GEORGE,"Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second there, Watkins?"
9,18,36,WATKINS,It's T-bone.
9,18,36,GEORGE,The thing is...I'm supposed to be T-bone.
9,18,36,WATKINS,Heh heh. You're not a T-bone. You're a perfect George.
9,18,36,GEORGE,"What? Now, you listen to me!"
9,18,37,KRUGER,"Hey, look at George. He's givin' it to T-bone. He's jumpin' up and down like some kind of monkey. Hey, what was the name of that monkey that could read sign language?"
9,18,37,WATKINS,"All right, you can have T-bone. Stop crying."
9,18,37,GEORGE,I'm not crying. And I shouldn't have said that about your wife. Please accept my apologies.
9,18,38,GEORGE,"Ok, everybody, uh...I have an announcement to make. From now on, I will be known as-"
9,18,38,KRUGER,Koko the monkey.
9,18,38,GEORGE,What?
9,18,38,ALL,Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko!
9,18,39,MAN,Thank you both for being here.
9,18,39,EALINE,"Um, excuse me. I live in the building. Did something happen to Mrs. Krantz?"
9,18,39,MAN,She passed.
9,18,39,ELAINE,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
9,18,39,MAN,Thank you.
9,18,39,ELAINE,A quick question-- did she by any chance have a 212 phone number?
9,18,39,CINDY,"I can't find my earring. Oh, here it is."
9,18,40,KRAMER,"Hey, listen, can I borrow your suitcases?"
9,18,40,JERRY,Yeah. It's in your closet.
9,18,40,KRAMER,"No, no, no. I looked."
9,18,40,JERRY,They're behind my skis and my tennis racket.
9,18,40,KRAMER,"Thanks, buddy."
9,18,40,JERRY,Where you goin'?
9,18,40,KRAMER,"Huh? Well, I'm gettin' out of town. I'm gonna visit Madeline for the weekend. You know, this place is lookin' kinda messy. What happened to Cindy?"
9,18,40,JERRY,"Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it."
9,18,40,KRAMER,Oh.
9,18,41,CINDY,"Hi, Kramer."
9,18,42,CINDY,"Thanks, Jerry. Bye."
9,18,43,KRAMER,"Well, what's the matter?"
9,18,43,JERRY,What did I just pay for?
9,18,43,KRAMER,Uh-oh. You're a john.
9,18,43,JERRY,Koko?
9,18,44,GEORGE,Koko.
9,18,44,JERRY,"Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is."
9,18,44,GEORGE,"Yeah. So, how's Cindy the maid?"
9,18,44,JERRY,"Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' for sex."
9,18,44,GEORGE,"Tell me about it. I went out with this girl last week. First I had to pay for dinner, then--"
9,18,44,JERRY,"No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like I'm seein' a prostitute."
9,18,44,GEORGE,How much you pay this maid?
9,18,44,GEORGE,"40? I'm payin' 60 to my maid. She doesn't do laundry and I'm gettin' nothin'. All right. Once she pinched my ass, but I don't know what that was."
9,18,44,JERRY,I don't know what this is.
9,18,45,KRAMER,"Hey, hey, hey. Look at that."
9,18,46,JERRY,Ooh.
9,18,46,KRAMER,"Jerry, you wouldn't believe what it's like down there. Taxicab drivers are insane. You know, everybody is in a hurry."
9,18,46,GEORGE,I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look straight forward.
9,18,46,KRAMER,"Well, now I can't see Jerry."
9,18,46,JERRY,I look about the same.
9,18,46,GEORGE,What?
9,18,46,JERRY,I was talking to him.
9,18,46,KRAMER,What?
9,18,46,JERRY,Never mind.
9,18,46,KRAMER,Come on. What'd he say?
9,18,46,GEORGE,Never mind.
9,18,46,KRAMER,"Jerry, come on. What'd you say?"
9,18,47,JERRY,What?
9,18,47,KRAMER,Come on. Where'd you go?
9,18,47,JERRY,Go back.
9,18,47,KRAMER,Eh! Come on. What did you say?
9,18,47,JERRY,"I said, never mind."
9,18,47,KRAMER,"Yeah. I know that. Uh, uh."
9,18,47,JERRY,I hate the counter.
9,18,48,ELAINE,Hey.
9,18,48,JERRY,Hey.
9,18,48,ELAINE,I hate the counter.
9,18,48,KRAMER,Who's that?
9,18,48,ELAINE,"Well, I got a 212 number from this little old lady in my building-- Mrs. Krantz."
9,18,48,JERRY,"Oh, she didn't mind?"
9,18,48,ELAINE,No. She died.
9,18,48,JERRY,"Hey, that's great."
9,18,48,GEORGE,What happened to Mrs. Krantz?
9,18,48,JERRY,Elaine got a new number because she died.
9,18,48,KRAMER,Newman died?
9,18,48,ELAINE,What did he say?
9,18,48,JERRY,Some new kind of pie.
9,18,48,GEORGE,I'll try a piece.
9,18,48,KRAMER,"All right, who's down there?"
9,18,48,JERRY,"Hey, there's a booth."
9,18,49,KRAMER,"Hey, Elaine."
9,18,49,ELAINE,"Oh, hi."
9,18,49,KRAMER,Did you hear about Newman?
9,18,49,ELAINE,What?
9,18,51,GEORGE,Hey.
9,18,51,JERRY,So how's it goin' at work? They get tired of it?
9,18,51,GEORGE,"Oh, yeah."
9,18,52,JERRY,Double zero?
9,18,52,GEORGE,"It's ""ooh"" As in ""ooh ooh ah ah."""
9,18,52,CINDY,Your nickname's Koko? One of the girls down at the maid service is named Coco.
9,18,52,GEORGE,Really? Coco?
9,18,52,CINDY,Yeah. Coco. That girl's all right.
9,18,53,GEORGE,"You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger, they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would never allow 2 Kokos."
9,18,53,JERRY,Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.
9,18,53,GEORGE,Say good-bye to Koko.
9,18,54,JERRY,"Good-bye, Koko."
9,18,54,KRAMER,"Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me. The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't realize it, but I'm a needy person."
9,18,54,JERRY,"Kramer, maybe this relationship isn't for you."
9,18,54,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah? So what am I supposed to do, be more like you? All sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen for sexual favors! No! Jerry, I won't be like you! Never! I'll never be like you!"
9,18,55,CINDY,What was that?
9,18,55,JERRY,I didn't hear anything.
9,18,55,CINDY,"All right, I'm takin' off. Aren't you forgetting something?"
9,18,55,JERRY,"Oh, right! Hey, it was great seeing you again. I love your outfit."
9,18,55,CINDY,No. My money.
9,18,55,JERRY,For what?
9,18,55,CINDY,For my maid services. You booked me for today.
9,18,55,JERRY,But you didn't really do any work.
9,18,55,CINDY,I made the bed.
9,18,55,JERRY,But you took a nap in it.
9,18,55,CINDY,So?
9,18,55,JERRY,I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.
9,18,55,CINDY,No. That was the maid.
9,18,55,JERRY,"Well, who took the nap?"
9,18,55,CINDY,The girlfriend.
9,18,55,JERRY,$40 seems kind of steep for a nap.
9,18,55,CINDY,"So, what are you saying? That I'm a bad maid or some kind of a prostitute?"
9,18,55,JERRY,"Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated."
9,18,55,CINDY,"You know, I don't think I want to be your girlfriend or your maid."
9,18,55,JERRY,So is this a breakup/quitting?
9,18,55,CINDY,Yeah. Don't ever call me or hire me again.
9,18,56,JERRY,"Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired!"
9,18,56,PHONE MAN,Sign here.
9,18,56,ELAINE,Yes! 212.
9,18,57,ELAINE,"Hey, what happened to the guy I had last time?"
9,18,57,PHONE MAN,"Oh, you know, it's an odd thing. He went out on a job and never came back. Nobody knows what happened."
9,18,58,ELAINE,All right! I am back in the game.
9,18,59,ELAINE,Hello?
9,18,59,BOY,Gammy!
9,18,59,ELAINE,"No. You got the wrong number, kid."
9,18,59,BOY,"Gammy Krantz, it's your grandson Bobby. Why haven't you called?"
9,18,59,ELAINE,Oh...nuts.
9,18,59,BOY,Do you hate me 'cause of my lazy eye?
9,18,59,ELAINE,No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here.
9,18,60,JERRY,So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead? G-5?
9,18,60,ELAINE,Hit. No. I guess his parents didn't want to tell him. B-2?
9,18,60,JERRY,Miss.
9,18,60,ELAINE,He called 6 times yesterday. What a nightmare it must be to have a real family.
9,18,60,JERRY,I wouldn't worry about it. B-6?
9,18,60,ELAINE,Hit. Uhh...you sank my submarine.
9,18,60,JERRY,Elaine...
9,18,61,JERRY,Hello?
9,18,61,COMPUTER VOICE,You have a collect call from--
9,18,61,KRAMER,"Hey, buddy, don't say no!"
9,18,61,JERRY,I accept.
9,18,61,KRAMER,"I went down to Madeline's. I told her, ""You gotta move, or it's over."""
9,18,61,JERRY,"Well, what happened?"
9,18,62,KRAMER,"I think it's over. We had a big fight, she threw me out, I started walkin', and now I'm lost downtown! I don't have any money. I don't recognize anybody. I miss home,"
9,18,63,JERRY,What's around you?
9,18,63,KRAMER,I'm lookin' at Ray's Pizza. You know where that is?
9,18,63,JERRY,Is it Famous Ray's?
9,18,63,KRAMER,No. It's Original Ray's.
9,18,63,JERRY,Famous Original Ray's?
9,18,63,KRAMER,"It's just Original, Jerry!"
9,18,63,JERRY,"Well, what street are you on?"
9,18,63,KRAMER,"Hey, I'm on first and first. How can the same street intersect with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe."
9,18,63,JERRY,"Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive no matter what occurs, I will find you!"
9,18,63,KRAMER,Aah!
9,18,65,MAN,You Steinfeld?
9,18,65,JERRY,Yeah.
9,18,65,MAN,My name is Maxwell. I'm from Maid To Order. It's a pun. I sent one of my girls over to your place.
9,18,65,JERRY,Cindy.
9,18,65,MAN,She says she had a little problem with you. You didn't pay.
9,18,65,JERRY,"You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to do."
9,18,65,MAN,"Oh, yeah? She told me what you like. You're a little sickie, aren't you? Disinfectant on the blinds, vacuuming the counter--"
9,18,65,JERRY,"Hey, come on. Come on. I gotta live around here."
9,18,65,MAN,You know what I do to people who stiff me on a job?
