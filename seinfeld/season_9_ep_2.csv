9,2,0,THE SERENITY NOW,Written by Steve Koren
9,2,1,FRANK,I got no leg room back here. Move your seat forward.
9,2,1,ESTELLE,That's as far as it goes.
9,2,1,FRANK,"There's a mechanism. You just pull it, and throw your body weight."
9,2,1,ESTELLE,I pulled it. It doesn't go.
9,2,1,FRANK,"If you want the leg room, say you want the leg room! Don't blame"
9,2,2,GEORGE,"All right, Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit"
9,2,3,FRANK,"Like an animal. Because of her, I have to sit here like an animal!"
9,2,4,GEORGE,What is that?
9,2,4,FRANK,Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. When my blood pressure gets
9,2,5,GEORGE,Are you supposed to yell it?
9,2,5,FRANK,The man on the tape wasn't specific.
9,2,5,GEORGE,What happened to the screen door? It blew off again?
9,2,5,ESTELLE,I told you to fix that thing.
9,2,5,FRANK,Serenity nowww!
9,2,5,PATTY,So I told Bobby and Lisa that we'd try the new Chinese Spanish
9,2,6,JERRY,"Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener."
9,2,6,PATTY,Well I thought this would be more fun so I gave the tickets away.
9,2,6,JERRY,"What? All right, fine."
9,2,6,PATTY,Are you mad at me?
9,2,6,JERRY,"No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is."
9,2,6,PATTY,You know... I've never seen you mad.
9,2,6,JERRY,I get peeved.
9,2,6,PATTY,Mad.
9,2,6,JERRY,Miffed.
9,2,6,PATTY,*Mad*.
9,2,6,JERRY,Irked?
9,2,6,PATTY,I'd like to see you get *really* mad.
9,2,6,GEORGE,Why does she want you to be mad?
9,2,6,JERRY,She says I suppress my emotions.
9,2,6,GEORGE,So what do you care what she thinks.
9,2,6,JERRY,Good body.
9,2,6,GEORGE,She probably gets that impression because you're cool.
9,2,7,JERRY,"But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell."
9,2,7,GEORGE,Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic
9,2,8,KRAMER,Hey.
9,2,8,JERRY,"Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all my food."
9,2,9,KRAMER,"What is that, a new bit?"
9,2,9,GEORGE,"I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help me fix"
9,2,10,JERRY,"Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx."
9,2,10,KRAMER,I'll do it.
9,2,10,GEORGE,Really? You wanna come?
9,2,10,KRAMER,"Yeah, I love going to the country."
9,2,10,ELAINE,Where are they goin'?
9,2,10,JERRY,Fix a screen door in Queens.
9,2,10,ELAINE,"That's funny. Hey, listen, what are you doin' Saturday"
9,2,11,JERRY,Not goin' to the Knick game.
9,2,11,ELAINE,I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar Mitzvah.
9,2,11,JERRY,"You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. You"
9,2,12,ELAINE,"Oh, I don't think that's possible."
9,2,12,KRAMER,Get in a little closer. I can't see the screen
9,2,13,GEORGE,"Dad, the hinges are all rusted here. That's why the wind keeps"
9,2,14,ESTELLE,I hate that old door. Throw it out!
9,2,14,FRANK,Serenity now!
9,2,14,KRAMER,"It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked"
9,2,15,FRANK,Will you put her to rest for me?
9,2,15,KRAMER,"Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her."
9,2,15,ESTELLE,Get George to put those boxes in the
9,2,16,GEORGE,"Dad, what's all this?"
9,2,16,ESTELLE,It's junk.
9,2,16,FRANK,My computers. I've been selling them for two months now. Shut up!
9,2,16,GEORGE,You're selling computers?
9,2,16,FRANK,"Two months ago, I saw a provocative movie on cable TV. It was"
9,2,18,GEORGE,"Dad, you know what it takes to compete with Microsoft and"
9,2,18,FRANK,"Yes, I do. That's why I got a secret weapon... my son."
9,2,18,JERRY,"Damn it, they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk!"
9,2,18,PATTY,
9,2,18,JERRY,You're damn right you're not buying it!
9,2,18,PATTY,You shouldn't have to try. It's just being open.
9,2,18,JERRY,I'm open. There's just nothing in there.
9,2,18,PATTY,Sarcastically) Uh huh.
9,2,18,JERRY,"Oh, you think I'm lying about this?"
9,2,18,PATTY,I think you are.
9,2,18,JERRY,"Well, I'm not."
9,2,18,PATTY,"Yes, you are, liar."
9,2,18,JERRY,"Oh, stop it."
9,2,18,PATTY,
9,2,18,JERRY,That's enough!
9,2,18,PATTY,"Ooh, that was good."
9,2,18,JERRY,Really? It felt good.
9,2,18,ELAINE,"Congratulations, Mr. Lippman."
9,2,18,LIPPMAN,"Oh, Elaine. My boy's a man today. Can you believe it? He's"
9,2,19,ELAINE,"Oh, congratulations, Adam. (Adam zealously French-kisses"
9,2,20,ADAM,I'm a man!
9,2,20,JERRY,Tongue?
9,2,20,ELAINE,Yeah.
9,2,20,GEORGE,Wow! I didn't try that 'til I was 23.
9,2,20,JERRY,Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man.
9,2,20,ELAINE,And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations to six
9,2,21,JERRY,"Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not want to"
9,2,23,ELAINE,Where did that come from?
9,2,23,JERRY,Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that?
9,2,23,ELAINE,No.
9,2,23,JERRY,Good.
9,2,23,GEORGE,"All right, relax, tough guy. I got to go out to my father's"
9,2,24,JERRY,What? The two of you workin' in that garage is like a steel cage
9,2,25,GEORGE,Kramer.
9,2,25,KRAMER,Yeah.
9,2,25,GEORGE,What-what are you doing?
9,2,25,KRAMER,"Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door. This beauty's got a"
9,2,26,JERRY,What do you need it for?
9,2,26,KRAMER,"The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA. Let's see"
9,2,27,GEORGE,"Morning, ma."
9,2,27,ESTELLE,You're late!
9,2,27,GEORGE,"Morning, dad."
9,2,27,FRANK,I'm not 'dad' in the workplace. My professional name is Mr.
9,2,28,LLOYD,"Morning, George. Two cream, no sugar."
9,2,28,GEORGE,What is Lloyd Braun doing here?
9,2,28,FRANK,Your mother recommended him.
9,2,28,GEORGE,"Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing up"
9,2,30,FRANK,I didn't read his resume.
9,2,30,BRAUN,"Another sale, Mr. Costanza. Chalk me up on"
9,2,31,GEORGE,What is this?
9,2,34,ELAINE,"So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology"
9,2,35,ADAM,I'm not apologizing. It was great. I told everyone.
9,2,35,ELAINE,"Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and"
9,2,36,ADAM,Are you free Friday night?
9,2,36,ELAINE,"I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and I am"
9,2,37,ADAM,But I'm a man. The rabbi said so.
9,2,37,ELAINE,No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become a
9,2,38,ADAM,"Well, if I'm not a man, then this whole thing was a sham! First,"
9,2,40,LIPPMAN,Who wants cookies?
9,2,40,ADAM,"As of this moment, I am no longer Jewish. I quit!"
9,2,40,LIPPMAN,What?
9,2,40,ELAINE,"Walnuts, mmmmmm."
9,2,40,FRANK,"You're late again, Costanza, so listen up. Starting tonight, we're"
9,2,42,ESTELLE,You're not giving away our Waterpik!
9,2,42,FRANK,Serenity now!
9,2,42,GEORGE,"You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit!"
9,2,42,FRANK,I guess your mother was right. You never could compete with Lloyd
9,2,43,GEORGE,You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell
9,2,46,ELAINE,"Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your"
9,2,48,ADAM,"Well, that does me a lot of"
9,2,49,ELAINE,"Well, I'm sorry, sir, I tried."
9,2,49,LIPPMAN,"So, that's the type of guy you're looking for?"
9,2,49,ELAINE,Uhh. I guess so. Why? (Mr. Lippman vigorously starts
9,2,50,PATTY,What is this?
9,2,50,JERRY,"Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer"
9,2,51,KRAMER,"Hello, neighbor."
9,2,51,JERRY,"Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely."
9,2,51,KRAMER,"Oh, you gotta mulch. You've got to."
9,2,51,JERRY,You barbecuing tonight?
9,2,51,KRAMER,Right after the fireworks.
9,2,51,JERRY,"So, where do you want to eat tonight?"
9,2,51,PATTY,How about La Caridad again?
9,2,51,JERRY,Again!? How much flan can a person eat!?
9,2,51,PATTY,"Jerry, you've been yelling at me all afternoon."
9,2,51,JERRY,"Well, I don't think more flan is the answer!"
9,2,51,PATTY,Maybe I should just leave.
9,2,51,JERRY,'Maybe'!?
9,2,51,PATTY,Good-bye!
9,2,51,JERRY,"Double good-bye! (As Patty leaves, open door reveals Kramer,"
9,2,52,KRAMER,"Hey, buddy!"
9,2,52,ELAINE,Hey. Happy New Year!
9,2,53,ELAINE,Did you and Patty just break up?
9,2,53,JERRY,"Yeah! In fact, she broke up with me! And I don't want to talk about"
9,2,54,ELAINE,"Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard"
9,2,55,JERRY,"That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also,"
9,2,56,ELAINE,Whoa. What is the matter?
9,2,56,JERRY,It's Patty.
9,2,56,ELAINE,"Jerry, you break up with a girl every week."
9,2,56,JERRY,What--what is this salty discharge?
9,2,56,ELAINE,Oh my God. You're crying.
9,2,56,JERRY,This is horrible! I care!
9,2,56,JERRY,Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without her.
9,2,56,KRAMER,"She's really gotten to you, hasn't she?"
9,2,56,JERRY,I don't know what's happening to me.
9,2,56,KRAMER,"Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come"
9,2,57,JERRY,That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora.
9,2,57,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, she... had one, too."
9,2,57,GEORGE,"Jerry, can I talk to you for a second? (They enter Jerry's"
9,2,58,KRAMER,"That's it, that's it! I"
9,2,60,GEORGE,Are you still down in
9,2,61,JERRY,You ever heard of a little thing called feelings?
9,2,61,GEORGE,"Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer!"
9,2,62,JERRY,"Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. Ever"
9,2,63,GEORGE,What?
9,2,63,JERRY,"I love you, George. Come here."
9,2,63,GEORGE,"I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what?"
9,2,64,JERRY,Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you.
9,2,64,KRAMER,Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn my back
9,2,67,JERRY,"Hose under my sink. I love *you*, Kramer!"
9,2,67,KRAMER,"I love you, too, buddy, and George--"
9,2,67,GEORGE,"I don't want to hear it, Kramer!"
9,2,67,KRAMER,"Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn this"
9,2,68,GEORGE,What signal? What-what signal?
9,2,68,KRAMER,"I'll yell, uh, 'Hoochie mama!'"
9,2,68,GEORGE,"If I do it, will you buy a computer?"
9,2,68,KRAMER,"On the signal, George. On the signal."
9,2,68,GEORGE,Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale.
9,2,68,JERRY,"I love you, Costanza."
9,2,68,GEORGE,Will you shut up?!
9,2,68,KRAMER,"Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet! George, turn on the"
9,2,69,ELAINE,So now the *other* Lippman kissed me.
9,2,69,GEORGE,"Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa."
9,2,69,ELAINE,What?
9,2,69,GEORGE,It means a non-Jewish woman.
9,2,69,ELAINE,"I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to"
9,2,70,GEORGE,You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of
9,2,71,ELAINE,"Oh, that's insane."
9,2,71,GEORGE,I'll tell you what's insane: the price that I could get you
9,2,72,ELAINE,I am not buying a computer from you.
9,2,72,GEORGE,There's porn.
9,2,72,ELAINE,Even so.
9,2,72,GEORGE,Damn it!
9,2,72,ELAINE,"Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that"
9,2,74,LIPPMAN,That's simply not true.
9,2,74,ELAINE,"If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me."
9,2,74,LIPPMAN,You are wrong. I'll prove it.
9,2,74,ELAINE,"Oh, no. Don't!"
9,2,74,LIPPMAN,I renounce Judaism!
9,2,74,ELAINE,Oy vey!
9,2,74,JERRY,"What happened to you, pal?"
9,2,74,KRAMER,Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They
9,2,75,JERRY,Are you all right?
9,2,75,KRAMER,"Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity now."
9,2,75,JERRY,"So, you're using Frank's relaxation method?"
9,2,78,KRAMER,Serenity!
9,2,78,ELAINE,Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is
9,2,80,JERRY,"Sit down, Elaine."
9,2,80,ELAINE,"Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing."
9,2,80,JERRY,I've been thinking about what it means to be complete.
9,2,80,ELAINE,Do you have an apple or anything?
9,2,80,JERRY,"Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble."
9,2,80,ELAINE,Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine.
9,2,80,JERRY,Looking everywhere for some kind of meaning...
9,2,80,ELAINE,"Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana!"
9,2,80,JERRY,"When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been right in"
9,2,81,ELAINE,What?
9,2,81,JERRY,Elaine...
9,2,81,GEORGE,"Jerry,"
9,2,85,JERRY,I'm asking Elaine to marry me.
9,2,86,JERRY,Elaine?
9,2,86,ELAINE,"Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman"
9,2,87,JERRY,Lippman?
9,2,90,JERRY,Can I help you?
9,2,90,ELAINE,No. Stay! Stay. Stay.
9,2,90,FRANK,"Hey, Braun, Costanza's kicking your butt!"
9,2,92,FRANK,"Costanza, you're white hot!"
9,2,92,PHONE,"If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and--"
9,2,92,FRANK,"Hey, Braun, I got good news and bad news. And they're both the"
9,2,92,SAME,"you're fired. Costanza, you've won the water pik!"
9,2,92,ESTELLE,You're not gonna give away that water pik!
9,2,92,FRANK,"You wanna bet? Serenity now, serenity now!"
9,2,92,LLOYD,"You know, you should tell your dad that 'serenity now' thing"
9,2,94,GEORGE,What do you know? You were in the nut house.
9,2,94,LLOYD,What do you think put me there?
9,2,94,GEORGE,I heard they found a family in your freezer
9,2,94,LLOYD,Serenity now. Insanity later.
9,2,94,JERRY,"What happened here,"
9,2,95,KRAMER,"Serenity now, serenity now..."
9,2,95,JERRY,Kramer!
9,2,95,KRAMER,"Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children,"
9,2,96,JERRY,You don't look well.
9,2,96,KRAMER,"Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the"
9,2,97,JERRY,"Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose."
9,2,100,GEORGE,Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun!
9,2,100,KRAMER,Serenity now!
9,2,100,GEORGE,"Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers?"
9,2,100,KRAMER,Serenity nooooowwwww!
9,2,100,GEORGE,Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls
9,2,102,KRAMER,"George, you listen to me. I owe ya one."
9,2,102,JERRY,He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it?
9,2,102,GEORGE,"Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't handle"
9,2,103,JERRY,"George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done."
9,2,105,GEORGE,All right... here goes...
9,2,105,ELAINE,"Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this"
9,2,106,RABBI,"Ha! Elaine, shiks-appeal is a myth, like the Yeti, or his North"
9,2,107,ELAINE,"Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied"
9,2,108,RABBI,"Elaine, there's much you don't understand about the Jewish"
9,2,109,ELAINE,"Well, what does that have to do...?"
9,2,109,RABBI,"You know, a member of my congregation has a timeshare in Myrtle"
9,2,111,GEORGE,"So, that's it. All of my darkest fears, and... everything I'm"
9,2,112,JERRY,"Yikes. Well, good luck with all that."
9,2,112,GEORGE,Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a
9,2,113,JERRY,I think you scared me straight.
9,2,113,ELAINE,"All right, Jerome, I'm in."
9,2,113,JERRY,What?
9,2,113,ELAINE,Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is
9,2,114,JERRY,"I tell ya, I don't see it happening."
9,2,114,ELAINE,What? What happened to the new Jerry?
9,2,114,JERRY,He doesn't work here anymore.
9,2,114,ELAINE,"Oh, well that's just *great!*"
9,2,114,GEORGE,"I love you, Jerry."
9,2,115,GEORGE,"You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the"
9,2,116,ELAINE,"Well, that's because you're an idiot."
9,2,116,FRANK,You single-handedly brought Costanza and Son to the brink of
9,2,117,GEORGE,Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales?
9,2,117,FRANK,He's crazy. His phone wasn't even hooked up. He just liked ringing
9,2,118,ESTELLE,I told you to clean out this garage. I have to put my car
9,2,119,FRANK,This is a place of business. I told you never to come in here.
9,2,120,ESTELLE,All right...
9,2,120,GEORGE,"Dad, you really should lay off the 'serenity now' stuff."
9,2,120,FRANK,"So, what am I supposed to say?"
9,2,120,GEORGE,'Hoochie mama'?
9,2,120,ESTELLE,"Move your crap, I'm comin' in!"
9,2,120,FRANK,No you're not! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama!
