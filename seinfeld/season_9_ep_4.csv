9,4,0,"JERRY, ON THE PHONE",Yeah. Yeah. All right. Uh-huh. Chinese food!
9,4,0,GEORGE,Who was it?
9,4,0,JERRY,I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting me a new SAAB.
9,4,0,GEORGE,What about your old car? They couldn't get Kramer's blood out of it?
9,4,0,JERRY,"No, the engine clotted. You know who set this whole thing up for me?"
9,4,1,GEORGE,Fragile Frankie Merman? I never liked that guy.
9,4,1,JERRY,Why? He's harmless.
9,4,1,GEORGE,Every summer you guys went to camp together. I was jealous. Felt like he was the summer me.
9,4,1,JERRY,"He was not the summer you. Besides, you had a summer me. Whitey Fisk,"
9,4,2,GEORGE,I made him up.
9,4,2,JERRY,So you never saw Last Tango in Paris?
9,4,2,GEORGE,No.
9,4,2,JERRY,Too bad. It was erotic. jackbooted thugs!
9,4,2,JERRY,'Pottery Barn'?
9,4,2,KRAMER,I got three 'Pottery Barn' catalogs in one day. That makes eight this month.
9,4,2,JERRY,Why don't you just throw 'em out?
9,4,2,KRAMER,"Oh, no. I've been saving them up here in your apartment. And now, it's payback time. 'Pottery Barn' is in for a world of hurt."
9,4,3,GEORGE,I can't. I gotta make the weekly call to the folks.
9,4,3,JERRY,So call now.
9,4,3,GEORGE,"I gotta prep. I need a couple of anecdotes, a few"
9,4,5,JERRY,That's him.
9,4,5,GEORGE,Is he still nuts?
9,4,5,JERRY,"What do you think? They gave me a new car for thirty minutes of 'So, who's from out of town?' or what?"
9,4,5,ELAINE,Mmm. De-lish.
9,4,5,PUDDY,Delish?
9,4,5,ELAINE,"Delish. You know, short for delicious."
9,4,5,PUDDY,"Oh, like scrump."
9,4,5,ELAINE,Yeah.
9,4,5,PUDDY,I'm gonna be late. See ya later.
9,4,5,JACK,"Excuse me, can I borrow your ketchup?"
9,4,5,JACK,Thank you. Heraldic harp sounds as Elaine looks at Jack's face
9,4,5,GEORGE,"Hey, it's Georgie."
9,4,5,ESTELLE,Let me put your father on the phone.
9,4,5,GEORGE,Ma!
9,4,5,FRANK,Who is this?
9,4,5,GEORGE,"Dad, it's me. Hey, listen, I was at Fortunoff's the other day, and,"
9,4,6,"FRANK, HANGING UP","Sorry, George, our Chinese food just came. Talk to you"
9,4,7,GEORGE,Chinese food?
9,4,8,JERRY,"So, maybe they had Chinese food?"
9,4,8,GEORGE,"After dark? Please. At their age, that's like swallowing stun"
9,4,9,JERRY,"Well, there's one way to check. Where there's Chinese food, there's"
9,4,10,GEORGE,"That's dynamite. Yeah, I'll look for the Chinese food leftovers."
9,4,10,ELAINE,"Hey, hey, hey! I met this guy! And it was like this, totally unreal,"
9,4,11,JERRY,"It wasn't Whitey Fisk, was it?"
9,4,11,ELAINE,"Oh, George's friend. Whatever happened to him?"
9,4,11,GEORGE,"Nothing. Uh, I don't know. I gotta go."
9,4,11,JERRY,"So, this is beautiful. You, and Puddy, and this new guy, in a big pot"
9,4,12,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah... Puddy. Well, I won't fire him until I see if this new"
9,4,14,JERRY,Stop the mail?
9,4,14,KRAMER,That's... even better!
9,4,14,FRANKIE,Jerry!
9,4,14,JERRY,"Hey, Frankie! So, where's the car?"
9,4,14,FRANKIE,This is it.
9,4,14,JERRY,Inside the van?
9,4,14,FRANKIE,"It is the van! Don't you remember, we always talked about how cool"
9,4,15,JERRY,We were ten.
9,4,15,FRANKIE,Come on. Let's take it for a spin.
9,4,15,JERRY,I don't want a van.
9,4,15,ELAINE,"Well, just tell him you want the SAAB."
9,4,15,JERRY,You don't understand. This is Fragile Frankie Merman. When we were in
9,4,16,ELAINE,"Well, I have an idea. Keep the van, and get a bumper sticker that"
9,4,17,JERRY,Always helpful.
9,4,17,ESTELLE,"Oh, Georgie, what are you doing here?"
9,4,17,GEORGE,"Just dropped in for a visit. You, uh, you never called me back."
9,4,17,ESTELLE,Uh... the phone broke.
9,4,17,FRANK,"Well, we got to get moving."
9,4,17,GEORGE,What? Where are you going?
9,4,17,FRANK,We have a catered affair.
9,4,17,GEORGE,You're going like that? suspicious.
9,4,17,JACK,"Elaine, I'm sorry I'm late. Heraldic harp sounds as Elaine looks at Jack's face"
9,4,17,JACK,I'm gonna be in the can.
9,4,17,ELAINE,"Okay, Jack."
9,4,17,CASHIER,Sure. right. Again.
9,4,17,JERRY,"Aye, aye."
9,4,17,FRANKIE,"Oh, there's a spot. Just back up. Large-vehicle reverse beeping starts"
9,4,17,JERRY,Hold on. There must be a truck backing up.
9,4,17,FRANKIE,"No, that's us."
9,4,17,JERRY,"Great. You know, Frankie, I was wondering. What if I decided that"
9,4,19,FRANKIE,You don't like the van?
9,4,19,JERRY,"No, no, no. Just hypothetically."
9,4,19,FRANKIE,I gotta go to the park.
9,4,19,JERRY,"No! No, you don't! No woods. I love the van. I'm a van guy."
9,4,20,JERRY,Where'd you get the bricks?
9,4,20,KRAMER,"Jerry, the whole building is brick."
9,4,20,JERRY,So you want to take a ride with me out to Jersey? I'm gonna try to
9,4,21,KRAMER,"A dealer? Are you insane? No, take out an ad. Sell it privately."
9,4,21,JERRY,I don't think I want to meet the people that are in the market for a
9,4,22,KRAMER,"Come on, Jerry, just let me help you."
9,4,22,KRAMER,"All right! OK! Right, here we go. Yeah. OK, so... 'For sale. A big,"
9,4,23,JERRY,I don't want to trade.
9,4,23,KRAMER,"No, you don't have to. It's all about tickling their buying bone."
9,4,23,JERRY,"Hey, you know what? This is all your mail. They're puttin' it in my"
9,4,24,KRAMER,"Oh, that's it. They have gone too far. They keep pushing me, and"
9,4,25,ELAINE,"Hey, Jerry. I'd like you to meet someone. This is Jack."
9,4,26,POSTAL EMPLOYEE,May I help you?
9,4,26,KRAMER,"Yeah, I'd like to cancel my mail."
9,4,26,POSTAL EMPLOYEE,Certainly. How long would you like us to hold it?
9,4,26,KRAMER,"Oh, no, no. I don't think you get me. I want out, permanently."
9,4,26,NEWMAN,"I'll handle this, Violet. Why don't you take your three hour break?"
9,4,27,KRAMER,"Oh, yes, I am."
9,4,27,NEWMAN,What about your bills?
9,4,27,KRAMER,The bank can pay 'em.
9,4,27,NEWMAN,The bank. What about your cards and letters?
9,4,27,KRAMER,"E-mail, telephones, fax machines. Fedex, telex, telegrams,"
9,4,28,NEWMAN,"All right, it's true! Of course nobody needs mail. What do you"
9,4,30,SUPERVISOR,"Is everything all right here, Postal Employee Newman?"
9,4,30,NEWMAN,"Yes, sir, I believe everything is all squared away. Isn't it, Mr."
9,4,31,KRAMER,"Oh, yeah. As long as I stop getting mail!"
9,4,31,ESTELLE,Oh!
9,4,31,GEORGE,Quick for a... catered affair.
9,4,31,FRANK,I don't know what you mean.
9,4,31,GEORGE,You ditched me. That's twice. Now I demand to know what's going on!
9,4,31,FRANK,"George, we've had it with you. Understand? We love you like a son,"
9,4,32,ESTELLE,"The breakups, the firings. And every Sunday with the calls."
9,4,32,FRANK,What my wife is trying to say is that this is supposed to be our
9,4,33,GEORGE,I'm not following.
9,4,33,FRANK,We're cuttin' you lose.
9,4,33,GEORGE,You're cuttin' me loose?
9,4,33,FRANK,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to make love to your mother."
9,4,33,GEORGE,They don't want to see me anymore!
9,4,33,JERRY,But this is what you've always wanted.
9,4,33,GEORGE,It is. I'm just not ready yet.
9,4,33,JERRY,"Aw, that's kind of sweet."
9,4,33,GEORGE,"Ah, shut up, Jerry. My parents think they can ignore me. Heh heh."
9,4,34,JERRY,"Oh, no. George, please. What are you going to do?"
9,4,34,GEORGE,You remember my cousin Rhisa? I'm gonna date her.
9,4,34,JERRY,Mother of God.
9,4,34,GEORGE,"One little wink. She'll freak out, tell my parents. They'll be all"
9,4,35,JERRY,That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me. I think he may
9,4,38,JERRY,That is the guy!
9,4,38,GEORGE,Elaine's in love with the Wiz guy?
9,4,38,JERRY,"No, she thinks she's in love with him. But she's just remembering"
9,4,39,GEORGE,That's pretty pathetic.
9,4,39,JERRY,I know. They're not even related.
9,4,39,GEORGE,Uh... hey. I'm gonna get going.
9,4,39,JERRY,"Hey, have fun at the... family reunion. So, what do you know about"
9,4,40,ELAINE,Isn't he the best?
9,4,40,JERRY,"Yeah, nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do?"
9,4,40,ELAINE,"Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine. It's not"
9,4,42,ELAINE,"Oh, no."
9,4,42,JERRY,"Oh, yes."
9,4,43,RHISA,"Yeah, thanks."
9,4,43,GEORGE,"Sure. You know, Rhisa. I've always found you... very attractive."
9,4,43,RHISA,What?
9,4,43,GEORGE,"I know it may sound shocking. But, I just can't stop myself from..."
9,4,44,RHISA,"You want to borrow money, right?"
9,4,44,GEORGE,"No, no. I-I just want us to be... together."
9,4,44,RHISA,All right.
9,4,44,GEORGE,All right?
9,4,44,RHISA,Let's go for it.
9,4,44,GEORGE,Well... we could dance around it a little first.
9,4,44,GEORGE,Whoa! Whoa! Geez!
9,4,44,JERRY,You know why I'm selling it. I hate it.
9,4,44,KRAMER,How many miles?
9,4,44,JERRY,Two.
9,4,44,KRAMER,City or highway?
9,4,44,JERRY,"Look, do you really want to buy this thing, or what?"
9,4,46,JERRY,"All right, just get out of here."
9,4,46,KRAMER,"All right, look. I'm going to be honest. I'm very interested in the"
9,4,47,JERRY,
9,4,48,JERRY,You put that in!
9,4,48,JERRY,You want to trade me an undershirt?
9,4,48,KRAMER,"No, I want to trade you screen legend Anthony Quinn's undershirt. He"
9,4,49,JERRY,That's disgusting.
9,4,49,KRAMER,"Well, it's my final offer."
9,4,49,PUDDY,You dumped me for some idiotic TV pitchman.
9,4,49,ELAINE,"Look, I'm sorry, Puddy. It-it was a mistake. So, let's just put it"
9,4,50,PUDDY,"Gee, I don't know. What if we're out somewhere and you see the Maytag"
9,4,51,ELAINE,You're not taking me back?
9,4,51,"PUDDY, LEAVING",That's right.
9,4,51,ELAINE,He's not idiotic. He's the Wiz. And nobody beats him. Nobody...
9,4,52,WOMAN,Why does this dummy have a bucket on its head?
9,4,52,KRAMER,Because we're blind to their tyranny.
9,4,52,WOMAN,Then shouldn't you be wearing the bucket?
9,4,52,KRAMER,"Yeah. Move along, Betty."
9,4,52,FRANKIE,"Is this, uh, Jerry Seinfeld's van?"
9,4,52,KRAMER,"Well, not anymore. He traded it to me for some Hollywood"
9,4,53,FRANKIE,"I'm, uh, I'm so stupid."
9,4,53,KRAMER,What?
9,4,53,KRAMER,"Yeah, nice to meet you."
9,4,53,JERRY,She's into it?
9,4,53,GEORGE,She's leaving me dirty messages on my answering machine.
9,4,53,JERRY,So have your parents found out about it?
9,4,53,GEORGE,She wants to keep it quiet. She... thinks we have a real future
9,4,54,JERRY,"Brave new world, alright."
9,4,54,JERRY,"Hey, how's the anti-mail campaign going?"
9,4,54,KRAMER,"Oh, it's fantastic. We were out in front of the post office today,"
9,4,55,JERRY,It's Sunday.
9,4,55,GEORGE,Why is the mailman wearing a bucket?
9,4,55,KRAMER,"Huh? Well, it symbolizes our persecution."
9,4,55,GEORGE,Then... shouldn't you be wearing the bucket.
9,4,55,JERRY,"Hey, I want my van keys back."
9,4,55,KRAMER,"Oh, well. I, uh, thought we made a deal for Quinn's t-shirt."
9,4,55,JERRY,Are you insane? Give 'em to me.
9,4,55,KRAMER,"No, I can't, I can't. See, I told Frank he could borrow it. Yeah, he"
9,4,56,GEORGE,Wait a minute? He's picking up the van tonight? This is perfect.
9,4,58,KRAMER,"Oh, listen, Jerry. One of your friends came by and he was very upset"
9,4,59,JERRY,"Oh, no, not Frankie."
9,4,59,KRAMER,"Well, I didn't catch his name, but then he went running into the"
9,4,60,JERRY,"Oh, no, the woods! The hole!"
9,4,60,NEWMAN,"Kramer, what the hell are you doing?"
9,4,60,KRAMER,"I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket to something else."
9,4,60,NEWMAN,Not that!
9,4,60,KRAMER,What?
9,4,60,NEWMAN,"You're in trouble, Kramer. I shouldn't even be talking to you, but"
9,4,63,KRAMER,Are you through?
9,4,63,NEWMAN,No! And no one will ever see you again!
9,4,63,KRAMER,Are you through?
9,4,63,NEWMAN,"Yes. No, wait! OK, yes. in!"
9,4,63,KRAMER,"Oh, no, no, no. That's exactly how you said it was going down."
9,4,63,NEWMAN,"There's another way it can go down, and it's going down right now!"
9,4,63,KRAMER,"No. You said a mailman I know, and you're a mailman I know!"
9,4,63,NEWMAN,"I know you know, but you don't know what I know."
9,4,63,JERRY,"Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie, is that you?"
9,4,63,HOLE DIGGER,My name is Edgar.
9,4,63,JERRY,Have a nice night.
9,4,63,HOLE DIGGER,Thank you.
9,4,64,NEAR HIM,Stupid... so stupid! Jerry?
9,4,64,RHISA,"All right, George. I'm ready."
9,4,64,GEORGE,"Yeah, hold on. I'm, uh, I'm just trying to get a reading on my"
9,4,65,RHISA,Geor-gie... Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van?! he saying?
9,4,65,GEORGE,"I think he's saying 'Son of Sam'! Oh, my God!"
9,4,65,RHISA,"No, they caught him."
9,4,65,ELAINE,"So I told him, 'Hit the road. I'm going back with Jack.'"
9,4,65,JACK,"Elaine, that's the second piece of good news today."
9,4,65,ELAINE,"Really, what was the first? again."
9,4,65,ELAINE,What?
9,4,65,"JACK, DANCING AROUND",I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!
9,4,65,ELAINE,"Well what, what about your fact-checking job?"
9,4,65,"JACK, DANCING AROUND","Oh... here's a fact. Uh, I'm... the Wiz! I'm the Wiz"
9,4,67,FRANKIE,You hate the van.
9,4,67,JERRY,"But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being a van guy,"
9,4,68,FRANKIE,"So, can we go for a ride?"
9,4,68,JERRY,"Yeah, let's just get out of here. with that?"
9,4,69,ESTELLE,Why did Kramer have to park the van in the woods?
9,4,69,FRANK,Isn't it obvious? There are no parking meters out here.
9,4,70,POSTMASTER GENERAL,"Oh, my goodness. What have they done to you here?"
9,4,70,KRAMER,Huh? Who are you?
9,4,70,POSTMASTER GENERAL,"Well, you can just call me Henry."
9,4,70,KRAMER,Henry Atkins? The postmaster general?
9,4,70,POSTMASTER GENERAL,Last time I checked.
9,4,70,KRAMER,Henry... can I get out of here now?
9,4,70,POSTMASTER GENERAL,"Oh, oh. Sit a bit. Sit a bit. I mean, after all, I drove"
9,4,71,KRAMER,Oh?
9,4,71,POSTMASTER GENERAL,I even had to cancel a round of golf with the secretary
9,4,72,KRAMER,Yeah.
9,4,72,POSTMASTER GENERAL,"Kramer, I've been, uh, reading some of your material"
9,4,74,KRAMER,Yeah! Ha ha.
9,4,74,POSTMASTER GENERAL,"Well, it's my job. And I'm pretty damn serious about it."
9,4,77,KRAMER,"I'm very, very sorry."
9,4,77,POSTMASTER GENERAL,"Sure, you're sorry. I think we got a stack of mail out"
9,4,79,KRAMER,"Sure do! Kramer, seeing Newman walk into the office with a bucket on his head,"
9,4,79,"NEWMAN, WHIMPERING",Tell the world my story.
9,4,79,JERRY,"Hey, George!"
9,4,79,GEORGE,"Jerry! Hey, that's the guy!"
9,4,79,JERRY,"What? George Costanza, Frankie Merman."
9,4,79,GEORGE,Oh. The summer me.
9,4,79,FRANKIE,The winter me.
9,4,79,JERRY,You must be George's cousin.
9,4,79,RHISA,Girlfriend.
9,4,79,JERRY,All right.
9,4,79,JERRY,Don't go a-knockin'.
9,4,79,FRANKIE,Now you gotta sell this van.
9,4,79,JERRY,"Oh, yeah."
9,4,79,FRANK,What you saw in that van was a natural expression of a man's love for
9,4,80,GEORGE,Ohhhh...
9,4,80,ESTELLE,Your father's right. It's beautiful.
9,4,80,FRANK,And it was safe.
9,4,80,GEORGE,"Oh, God..."
9,4,80,FRANK,"Now if you'll excuse me. Once again, your mother and I..."
9,4,80,GEORGE,Oh... make it stop.
9,4,80,THE END,
