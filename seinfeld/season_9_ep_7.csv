9,7,1,GEORGE,"So, Elaine, are you going to sleep with me or what?!"
9,7,1,ELAINE,"George, I just got off a twenty-three hour plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought."
9,7,1,GEORGE,Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested.
9,7,1,JERRY,"Oh, I'm sure she'll come around."
9,7,1,GEORGE,"Yeah, I hope so. For your sake!"
9,7,2,JERRY,I said I was sorry.
9,7,2,GEORGE,"You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister!"
9,7,2,JERRY,Would you please stop saying that?!
9,7,2,KRAMER,What's up with you two?
9,7,2,GEORGE,I don't want to talk about it.
9,7,2,KRAMER,So how was the big trip?
9,7,2,JERRY,I don't want to talk about it!
9,7,2,KRAMER,"Well, what happened to your nose?"
9,7,2,ELAINE,I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it!
9,7,2,KRAMER,"Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the wedding? Was the bride radiant?"
9,7,2,ELAINE,She.. was.
9,7,2,JERRY,'Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.
9,7,2,KRAMER,"Ooohh.. That sounds juicy. Listen, I gotta go to the bathroom, but I want to hear all about it."
9,7,2,GEORGE,"You know, I didn't go to the bathroom the entire time we were in India."
9,7,2,JERRY,I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding!
9,7,5,SUE ELLEN,That's it! The wedding's off.
9,7,5,PINTER,"What? But, Sue Ellen-"
9,7,5,SUE ELLEN,"Elaine, you were my maid of honor and you slept with MY Pinter?!"
9,7,5,ELAINE,"No, no, no! It was years ago - before you met him. And, and I got to tell you.. it was very mechanical."
9,7,5,SUE ELLEN,I have never been so humiliated!
9,7,5,ELAINE,Idiots! This is all yoru fault!
9,7,5,GEORGE,Not me! Him! His fault! He betrayed me!
9,7,5,JERRY,"George, I'm sorry.."
9,7,5,GEORGE,"You can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister!"
9,7,5,JERRY,I don't know what that means.
9,7,5,GEORGE,"Alright, Nina, you have to decide right now. Jerry or me?"
9,7,5,NINA,Alright.. Neither.
9,7,5,GEORGE,"What?! Well, what are you doing here?"
9,7,5,NINA,"A free trip to India. And by the way, you can take off those boots. Everyone knows you're five' six."
9,7,5,GEORGE,Five' eight! Five' seven!
9,7,5,ELAINE,"See? See the way they are?! We're - we're still best friends, right?"
9,7,5,SUE ELLEN,No. And take that stupid thing out of your nose!
9,7,6,JERRY,"That's got to hurt, I don't care where you're from!"
9,7,6,GEORGE,What time is our flight back? I got to go to the bathroom.
9,7,10,ELAINE,Hey.
9,7,10,JERRY,Hey.
9,7,10,ELAINE,What happened last night?
9,7,10,JERRY,"Oh, you were pretty loaded."
9,7,10,ELAINE,I know. I woke up with this.
9,7,10,JERRY,"Oh. Hello, Tetanus."
9,7,11,NINA,"George, I've used the bathroom. It's fine."
9,7,11,GEORGE,"No, no, no, no. I can walk it off. It's a hundred and twenty degrees in here.. I'll sweat it out."
9,7,11,ELAINE,Hey. Are those Timberlands painted black?
9,7,11,GEORGE,Is your nose pierced?
9,7,11,ELAINE,I should..
9,7,11,GEORGE,"Yeah. Sit down there. Hello, Jerry. I"
9,7,12,JERRY,"George, we need to talk."
9,7,12,GEORGE,I think you've done a lot more than talk! You betrayed me!
9,7,12,JERRY,"Alright, I admit it. I slept with Nina, but that's all."
9,7,12,GEORGE,"""That's all""?! That's everything! I don't know what all the rest of it is for anyway!"
9,7,12,JERRY,I'm really sorry.
9,7,12,GEORGE,"You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister!"
9,7,12,JERRY,Where'd you get that one?
9,7,12,GEORGE,It's an expression.
9,7,12,ELAINE,Hey! Shhhhh!
9,7,12,GEORGE,"Look, we are gonna settle this right now! I demand reparations! I should get to sleep with Elaine. That's the only way to"
9,7,13,JERRY,"That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly, I might add."
9,7,13,GEORGE,Funny guy!
9,7,14,ELAINE,Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to get married up here!
9,7,14,GEORGE,"Elaine, you have to sleep with me."
9,7,14,ELAINE,I'm not gonna sleep with you.
9,7,14,GEORGE,Reparations!
9,7,14,ELAINE,"Would you grow up, George?! What is the difference? Nina slept with him, he slept with me, I slept with Pinter. Nobody cares! It's all"
9,7,15,GEORGE,You slept with the groom?!
9,7,20,KRAMER,"Oh, thank you, FDR!"
9,7,23,KRAMER,"Alright, FDR.. This wish is for all the marbles. You win, you get your wish - I drop dead. I win, I don't drop dead, and I get one-hundred percent"
9,7,24,FDR,Alright.
9,7,25,KRAMER,"Oh, man! Well, then, come on. There's got to be something that'll change your mind, FDR. Something.."""
9,7,29,ELAINE,George knows that you slept with Nina. That's why he was acting so weird.
9,7,29,JERRY,How did he find out?
9,7,29,ELAINE,He schnapped me.
9,7,29,JERRY,You know you're not supposed to drink whil you're keeping a secret! Is there anything else?
9,7,29,ELAINE,I can't tell you.
9,7,29,JERRY,"Here, drink this."
9,7,29,ELAINE,Okay. I slept with the groom.
9,7,29,JERRY,Pinter?
9,7,29,ELAINE,He used to be called Peter.
9,7,29,JERRY,So? Who cares about that?
9,7,29,ELAIEN,"Sue Ellen! If she knew, she'd call off the whole wedding."
9,7,29,JERRY,"Oh, nobody's calling off any weddings."
9,7,31,ELAINE,Do you know what 'Jerry' is in Indian?
9,7,31,JERRY,"No, what?"
9,7,31,ELAINE,Jugdish.
9,7,31,JERRY,"Yes, jugdish."
9,7,31,ELAINE,"Hey, what if I got my nose pierced? That would be pretty freaky.. Oooohhhhaaa!"
9,7,31,JERRY,"Yes, I think it's a fine idea. Well, good night."
9,7,32,ELAINE,"G'night, Jugdish."
9,7,35,JERRY,Bless you.
9,7,35,ELAINE,Thank you..
9,7,41,KRAMER,"Well, guess what, FDR? I made a wish on a shooting star last night, and I wished against your wish."
9,7,41,FDR,"That's funny. As it happens, I saw the same shooting star and double-wished you to drop dead. Here's your change."
9,7,42,KRAMER,"Alright, I'm triple-wishing! Yep!"
9,7,42,FDR,Then I'm quadruple-wishing!
9,7,42,KRAMER,Alright.. How do you like this? Ya!
9,7,42,FDR,I like it a lot. Ow!
9,7,42,KRAMER,Ah!
9,7,42,FDR,Oh!
9,7,45,ELAINE,"Oh, God, it's so hot! What's that smell?"
9,7,45,JERRY,I think it's the stench of death.
9,7,45,NINA,"George, you've been wearing those boots since I met you. You're not gonna wear them to the wedding, are you?"
9,7,45,GEORGE,No.. I'm gonna wear black shoes.
9,7,45,ELAIEN,"Oh boy. There's Sue Ellen. She didn't want me at this wedding, but here I am with a buch of my idiot friends!"
9,7,45,JERRY,This is gonna be great!
9,7,45,SUE ELLEN,"Elaine? Oh! Oh, I am so happy to see you!"
9,7,45,ELAINE,You are?
9,7,45,SUE ELLEN,"Well, of course! No one else was even willing to come to India. I mean, not even Pinter's parents - and they're Indian."
9,7,45,ELAIEN,"Come on, Sue Ellen. You don't wear a bra, you're tall.. we hate each other!"
9,7,45,SUE ELLEN,"Elaine, I know. I know we've had our problems, but.. I want you to be my maid of honor - and my best friend."
9,7,45,ELAINE,Huh.. alright. I guess.
9,7,45,SUE ELLEN,"Uh, this is my fiance, Pinter. Say hello."
9,7,45,PINTER,Hello.
9,7,45,ELAINE,Peter?
9,7,45,SUE ELLEN,"Uh, no. It's Pinter. Does anyone want to use the bathroom?"
9,7,45,GEORGE,"Oh, no. No. We're good. Let's get goin'. Alright. Watch it, funny man."
9,7,45,JERRY,"Elaine, have you noticed George was acting strage the whole flight?"
9,7,45,ELAINE,No. What? Like what? What? Strange.. No. I..
9,7,45,JERRY,"Uh-huh. Hey, look what they had on the plane. Schnapps."
9,7,45,ELAINE,Ooohh.
9,7,48,KRAME,Come on.. Come on. Yes! There's one! I wish I don't drop dead!!
9,7,48,MAN,"Hey, shut up up there!"
9,7,48,KRAMER,You shut up!
9,7,48,MAN,"Aw, drop dead!"
9,7,51,GEORGE,"Hello, friend. Enjoying the flight?"
9,7,51,JERRY,Coach to India - The only way to go.
9,7,51,GEORGE,"Good one. Very funny. You're very funny, Jerry. That's what I always tell people. Jerry Seinfeld's"
9,7,52,JERRY,You all right?
9,7,52,GEORGE,Of course I'm all right. I'm here with my girl. Nina. And what better way to pass the time than gabbing with my best friend.. with whom there are no
9,7,53,JERRY,"Hey, didn't I beat you up in the fourth grade?"
9,7,53,GEORGE,Funny guy! Right here!
9,7,54,NINA,"By the way, you never said anything to George about Jerry and me, did ya?"
9,7,54,ELAINE,Oh please.. It's in the vault.
9,7,55,GEORGE,"Ho, ho! Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!"
9,7,58,ELAINE,"Watch this. (Puts the bottle of Schnapps in her mouth, flips her head up, drinking it, then puts it back down with her teeth. She is effected by that last"
9,7,58,DRINK,) Oh.. God..
9,7,58,GEORGE,"So, Jerry and Nina, huh?"
9,7,58,ELAINE,"Oh, Mmm.. I'm not gonna tell you any more things.."
9,7,58,GEORGE,But you already told me everything.
9,7,58,ELAINE,Okey-dokey.
9,7,60,KRAMER,"I mean, we had a deal, Newman. And you were supposed to give my your birthday wish. And now you've wated it!"
9,7,60,NEWMAN,Did I?
9,7,60,WOMAN,"Newman, I'm bored."
9,7,60,NEWMAN,Aww..
9,7,60,KRAMER,Does your girlfriend have to be here?
9,7,60,NEWMAN,Does yours?
9,7,60,JERRY,I'm just hanging out in this hell-hole because of George.
9,7,60,KRAMER,"Alright, come on, Newman. Now you gotta help me! What am I gonna do about FDR?"
9,7,60,WOMAN,Why don't you just make another wish?
9,7,60,KRAMER,"And how am I gonna do that, Toots?"
9,7,60,WOMAN,What about a shooting star?
9,7,60,KRAMER,That's perfect..
9,7,60,NEWMAN,Beauty.. and brains.
9,7,60,JERRY,"Oh, come on. You know he's a postman, don't ya?"
9,7,63,GEORGE,Hey.
9,7,63,ELAINE,Here. You're going to India with us tomarrow.
9,7,63,GEORGE,For how long?
9,7,63,ELAINE,Three days.
9,7,63,GEORGE,"Great. Jerry, I gotta tell you, I had the best time with that Nina last night. I - I think I'm in love with her already. You are a great friend."
9,7,65,JERRY,"Hey, Kramer, what are you doing? You want to borrow something? You want to eat something? Come on"
9,7,66,KRAMER,Nah.
9,7,66,ELAINE,You want to go to India?
9,7,66,KRAMER,I can't. I'm gonna drop dead.
9,7,66,GEORGE,"Great! Nina could go, huh? Jerry, this is great. You and Elaine. Me and Nina.."
9,7,66,JERRY,"Hey, Kramer, wait up. I'll go with you."
9,7,66,KRAMER,I'm goin' to Newman's!
9,7,66,JERRY,"Great, I love Newman!"
9,7,66,GEORGE,Jerry seem a little weird when I mentioned Nina?
9,7,66,ELAINE,Nina? Nina? No. Psshhh.. Not weird. No. Nina.
9,7,66,GEORGE,Why do you keep saying Nina?
9,7,66,ELAIEN,I don't know. Nina. Nina! I'm gonna go grab a bite.
9,7,66,GEORGE,"Uhh.. I'll meet you down there. Cereal, cereal.. Peach schnapps."
9,7,68,KRAMER,"Come on, Lomez! We're gonna be late for the movie."
9,7,69,NEWMAN,"You see, my dear, all certified mail is registered, but registered mail is not necessarily cerified."
9,7,70,KRAMER,Anything you wish.. I'll tell you a little secret about zip codes: They're meaningless!
9,7,70,KRAMER,Wish?! Newman!
9,7,73,ALL,"..And you smell like one, too."
9,7,73,POSTMAN,"Make a wish, Newman! We've gotta get back to work in three hours!"
9,7,74,KRAMER,"Newman, wait!"
9,7,74,NEWMAN,Kramer! I'm with people.
9,7,74,KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah. And thanks for inviting me!"
9,7,74,NEWMAN,I did invite you.. Your invitation must've.. gotten lost in the mail.
9,7,75,KRAMER,"Well, Newman, I need your wish to protect me from FDR."
9,7,75,NEWMAN,Can't do it. I'm on an unbelievable birthday-wish hot streak! My last five birthday wishes came true.
9,7,75,KRAMER,"Come on! Look, I'll give you my next birthday wish, huh?"
9,7,75,NEWMAN,Your next.. fifty wishes.
9,7,75,KRAMER,Forty-eight.
9,7,75,NEWMAN,Fourty-nine.
9,7,75,KRAMER,Done!
9,7,75,NEWMAN AND KRAMER,Sucker..
9,7,76,NEWMAN,"Alright, alright, back, savages. Back! I haven't made my wish yet.."
9,7,80,ELAINE,"Well, this Mischke mish-mash is just gettin' worse."
9,7,80,JERRY,Uh-huh.
9,7,80,ELAINE,I talked with the groom's parents..
9,7,80,JERRY,Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm..
9,7,80,ELAINE,..And it's so obvious that they don't want..
9,7,80,JERRY,Uh-huh..
9,7,80,ELAINE,..me to go.
9,7,80,JERRY,Sure.
9,7,80,ELAINE,"So, the only reason.."
9,7,80,JERRY,Uh-huh.
9,7,80,ELAINE,..she sent me an invitation was that so I'd send her a gift.
9,7,80,JERRY,Uh-huh.
9,7,80,NINA,Jerry?
9,7,80,JERRY,"Uh, well, you know, a coffee grinder is nice. Or a coffee maker. Everyone likes coffee. Anything to do with coffee. Maybe you should go get"
9,7,82,NINA,Oh. Hi.
9,7,82,ELAINE,Hi.
9,7,82,NINA,"Oh, I should.. um.."
9,7,82,JERRY,Sure.
9,7,82,ELAINE,Bye.
9,7,82,NINA,Bye-bye.
9,7,82,ELAINE,Who else ya got back there?
9,7,82,JERRY,"Look, there was an awkward moment in the conversation. It never happened before."
9,7,82,ELAINE,You slept with Nina? What are you gonna tell George?
9,7,82,JERRY,Nothing. And neither will you. George can never know about this.. It'll crush him.
9,7,82,ELAINE,"Uh. Alright, alright. I'll put it in the vault."
9,7,82,JERRY,No good. Too many people know the combination.
9,7,82,ELAINE,What combination? Don't be rediculous.
9,7,83,JERRY,Oh my god. This drawer is filled with Fruit Loops!
9,7,83,ELAINE,So what?
9,7,83,JERRY,And milk.
9,7,84,KRAMER,"Oh, geez.."
9,7,84,JERRY,Hello?
9,7,88,ELAINE,Hi. Mr. and Mrs. Ranawat?
9,7,88,ZUBIN,"Please, call us Usha and Zubin."
9,7,88,ELAINE,"Oh. Well, Usha.."
9,7,88,ZUBIN,I'm Zubin.
9,7,88,ELAINE,"Anyway, your son is marrying my friend, Sue Ellen Mischke.."
9,7,88,USHA,"You're not going to the wedding, are you?"
9,7,88,ELAINE,Well..
9,7,88,USHA,"Don't go. India is a dreadful, dreadful place."
9,7,88,ZUBIN,"You know, it's the only country that still has the plague? I mean, the plague! Please!"
9,7,88,USHA,"Here's the registry. Send her a gift, and be glad you did not have to go."
9,7,88,ELAINE,Right. Don't go. Send a gift. I think I understand.
9,7,88,ZUBIN,"If I had to go to India, I wouldn't go to the bathroom the entire trip."
9,7,88,ELAINE,That's fantastic.
9,7,88,ZUBIN,"And I'm not so crazy about Manhattan, either."
9,7,91,NINA,"Oh, you were going to tell me all about George."
9,7,91,JERRY,"Ah, just remember when you see him tomarrow night to tell him that the waiter liked him."
9,7,91,NINA,Really?
9,7,91,JERRY,"Believe me. You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you."
9,7,91,NINA,"I know. You know, we never had a bad conversation."
9,7,91,JERRY,I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never fooled around..
9,7,91,NINA,Heh.. yeah.
9,7,91,JERRY,Probably the reason..
9,7,95,FDR,Are - are you dense? I said I wanted you to drop dead. Now.. drop dead!
9,7,95,KRAMER,I knew it.. Stupid Jerry..
9,7,96,JERRY,"Kramer, I know what I'm talking about. There's no way FDR wants you to drop dead."
9,7,96,KRAMER,But you haven't seen..
9,7,96,JERRY,Just go back and ask him again.
9,7,96,KRAMER,Yeah..
9,7,98,FDR,That's right. My birthday wish was for you to drop dead.
9,7,98,KRAMER,"Well, why?"
9,7,98,FDR,I have my reasons.
9,7,98,KRAMER,"Woah, wait, wait, wait. If you make a birthday wish out loud, it doesn't come true."
9,7,98,FDR,That's just a silly superstition.
9,7,99,KRAMER,"Hey, FDR wants me to drop dead."
9,7,99,KRAMER,"Yeah, Franklin Delano Romanowski. I go to his birthday part, and just before he blew out his candles, he gives"
9,7,100,GEORGE,Stink eye?
9,7,100,JERRY,Crook eye?
9,7,100,KRAMER,
9,7,100,JERRY,"Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday.."
9,7,100,GEORGE,"Oh, it's a bad day. Uh, you got everyone in your house, you're thinkin', ""These are my friends?!"""
9,7,100,JERRY,Everyday is my birthday.
9,7,100,KRAMER,"Yeah, well, I can't have this hanging over my head. It's bad mojo."
9,7,101,ELAINE,Hi.
9,7,102,ELAINE,You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail. An invitation to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding.
9,7,102,JERRY,"Well, at least the wedding gown will give her some support."
9,7,102,ELAINE,Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this today.
9,7,102,JERRY,So you think it's a non-vite?
9,7,102,ELAINE,"It's an un-vitation! Hey, are you gettin' taller?"
9,7,102,GEORGE,Timberlands.
9,7,102,ELAINE,"Ah. Hey, look at this. 'Pinter Ranawat'.. I wonder if he's related to that guy I dated, Peter Ranawat.."
9,7,102,JERRY,"Ah, it's probably like Smith over there."
9,7,102,GEORGE,"Jerry, would you make the call already?"
9,7,102,ELAINE,What call?
9,7,102,JERRY,"He wants me to set him up with this girl, Nina Stengal."
9,7,102,ELAINE,"Oh, the great conversation girl. The one you think can replace me?"
9,7,102,JERRY,I was kidding when I said that!
9,7,102,GEORGE,Told me the same thing.
9,7,102,JERRY,"Nina, Hi. It's Jerry."
9,7,102,GEORGE,You-you sure you never slept with her? Perfect.
9,7,102,JERRY,"Hey, how 'bout my friend, George? Quite a guy, huh?"
9,7,102,GEORGE,Ooh.. Something's not sitting right..
9,7,105,GEORGE,I'll have the clam casino.
9,7,105,JERRY,Get outta here.
9,7,105,GEORGE,"""Chef recommends"""
9,7,105,JERRY,Hmm..
9,7,105,GEORGE,I think she likes me.
9,7,105,JERRY,Sure.
9,7,105,GEORGE,"So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina? Is there a problem with her? Is she a man?"
9,7,105,JERRY,Are you?
9,7,105,GEORGE,"Well, what's the reason?"
9,7,105,JERRY,We were too compatible.. Our conversations were so engrossing.
9,7,105,GEORGE,How engrossing?
9,7,105,JERRY,"If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in Nina and not lose a step."
9,7,105,GEORGE,"Wow! Heh. You don't, huh, have a replacement lined up for me, do ya?"
9,7,106,JERRY,"Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the trasition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses.. I need an awkward pause."
9,7,106,GEORGE,"I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wwear them every time I see her."
9,7,106,JERRY,Why?
9,7,106,GEORGE,"In any othe shoe, I lose two inches. I - I can't have a drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!"
9,7,106,JERRY,"So, you're gonna wear 'em no matter what the situation?"
9,7,106,GEORGE,In every situation. No matter how silly I look. Hm.. tastes a little funky.
9,7,106,JERRY,"Oh, I'm sure it's fine."
9,7,109,ALL,..to you!
9,7,109,MAN,"Come on, make a wish! Make a wish!"
9,7,109,KRAMER,Yeah!
9,7,113,GEORGE,"Ah, this is the kind of day that almost makes you feel good to be alive."
9,7,113,JERRY,"Almost. Hey, new Timberlands?"
9,7,113,GEORGE,"Yeah, and a whole new me. I'm up two inches in these babies!"
9,7,113,JERRY,Really?
9,7,113,GEORGE,Five' eight. Five' seven.
9,7,114,NINA,Jerry?
9,7,114,JERRY,Nina?
9,7,114,NINA,Hi.
9,7,114,JERRY,It's been years!
9,7,114,NINA,Yeah!
9,7,114,JERRY,"George, this is Nina."
