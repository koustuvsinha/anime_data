9,8,0,"MELISSA,",Mmm-hmm.
9,8,0,GEORGE,She ate breakfast naked?
9,8,0,JERRY,She didn't even want a napkin.
9,8,0,GEORGE,"I've had bedroom naked, I've had walk-to-the-bathroom naked... I have never had living-room naked."
9,8,0,JERRY,"Oh, it's a scene."
9,8,0,GEORGE,"It's like you're livin' in the Playboy Mansion! Did she, uh, did she frolic?"
9,8,0,JERRY,I don't really have enough room.
9,8,0,"GEORGE,","Yeah. Hey, Lainie, Puddy."
9,8,0,ELAINE,Hey!

9,8,0,"ELAINE,",'Kay.
9,8,0,JERRY,Back together?
9,8,0,ELAINE,"His apartment was being fumigated, so we thought we'd give it another shot."
9,8,0,JERRY,Ah...
9,8,0,ELAINE,So guess who called me last night? Jason Hanke.
9,8,0,GEORGE,'Stanky Hanke'? What did he want?
9,8,0,ELAINE,He called to apologize for standing me up five years ago.
9,8,0,JERRY,Why now?
9,8,0,ELAINE,
9,8,1,GEORGE,Ho ho ho ho! I can't wait for Hanke to come crawling back to me.
9,8,1,JERRY,Still with the neck hole?
9,8,1,GEORGE,Still upset. Very upset.
9,8,1,ELAINE,What neck hole?
9,8,1,GEORGE,Remember that New Year's party he threw a few years ago? He had that
9,8,2,GEORGE,I asked if I could borrow a sweater.
9,8,2,JERRY,A cashmere sweater.
9,8,2,GEORGE,"I said preferably cashmere, for warmth. So in front of the whole"
9,8,3,ELAINE,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
9,8,3,GEORGE,"Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it up. Everybody else did!"
9,8,3,ELAINE,"Well, it's funny. I mean, you have a big head. Or is it 'cause of"
9,8,4,JERRY,"No, I think the head does most of the stretching."
9,8,4,GEORGE,Regardless. I had to walk around for the rest of the party in some
9,8,5,ELAINE,I really think it's the size of your neck.
9,8,5,GEORGE,It's my head!
9,8,5,ELAINE,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
9,8,5,ELAINE,Hey.
9,8,5,PEGGY,Hey.
9,8,5,ELAINE,"Isn't this great? With those nerds in accounting moved, you and I"
9,8,6,KRAMER,"You went to the coffee shop without me? I told ya, I just wanted to"
9,8,7,JERRY,That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there?
9,8,7,KRAMER,Showering. How long does it take you?
9,8,7,JERRY,Ten minutes.
9,8,7,"KRAMER,","Ten minutes? That's kooky talk. Hey Elaine, how long do you spend in the shower?"
9,8,7,ELAINE,Ten minutes.
9,8,7,KRAMER,Let me smell you.
9,8,7,ELAINE,All right. Whiff away.
9,8,7,"KRAMER,",Uh... that's not bad at all.
9,8,7,"ELAINE,",Hup! That's it.
9,8,7,ELAINE,"So get this. I'm in the bathroom at work today, and I see Peggy"
9,8,8,JERRY,So?
9,8,8,ELAINE,"So... we're the only women on the floor. I mean, we're like"
9,8,9,"JERRY,","All right! I'll get that. Well, maybe she just practices good hygiene."
9,8,9,"ELAINE,","Yeah, you're probably right. She's probably one of those neurotic clean freaks."
9,8,9,JERRY,Mmm.
9,8,9,KRAMER,"Well, here's my shower routine. Maybe I can make some changes. Get"
9,8,10,"JERRY,",Zephyr? That is not a word.
9,8,10,MELISSA,Do you challenge?
9,8,10,JERRY,"No, I do not challenge."
9,8,10,MELISSA,66 points. Ha ha.
9,8,10,JERRY,"I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't know where you'd hide the"
9,8,11,MELISSA,You want some more ice tea?
9,8,11,JERRY,Sure.
9,8,11,"MELISSA,",Wrong pipe.
9,8,11,"GEORGE,",So she coughed.
9,8,11,JERRY,"Coughing... naked... It's a turn-off, man."
9,8,11,GEORGE,Everything goes with naked.
9,8,11,JERRY,"When you cough, there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly"
9,8,13,GEORGE,"Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man. Do you now how much mental energy I"
9,8,14,JERRY,But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad
9,8,15,GEORGE,All right. It's grovel time.
9,8,15,HANKE,"Hey, George. Jerry. Listen, I just got sober, so I've been going"
9,8,16,GEORGE,"What are you up to now, uh, Step Nine?"
9,8,16,HANKE,Yeah. Making amends.
9,8,16,GEORGE,Important step. Maybe the most important.
9,8,16,HANKE,"Anyway, uh, Jerry, you know, this may sound dumb, but, you know, when"
9,8,19,JERRY,"Thank you. I did notice, and I appreciate you rectifying it."
9,8,19,HANKE,: Great. Great.
9,8,20,"KRAMER,","Well, I just got out of a 27-minute"
9,8,22,"JERRY,",You got some suds over here.
9,8,22,"KRAMER,","Wha...? Oh, man! Geez! Look at that! I'm all lathery. Jerry, you got to show me what I'm doing"
9,8,23,JERRY,"Oh, come on!"
9,8,23,KRAMER,"No, I mean it, man. I'm lost!"
9,8,23,JERRY,You promise you'll never come in here again?
9,8,23,"KRAMER,","Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that."
9,8,23,"JERRY,",Now my sense of it is that you're probably
9,8,24,KRAMER,"Well, that's how cats do it."
9,8,24,JERRY,"But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use"
9,8,25,KRAMER,
9,8,25,JERRY,"No, I told you, it's just a dry run."
9,8,25,"GEORGE,","Well, Hanke's moved on to Step Ten. He"
9,8,26,JERRY,That's Step Ten?
9,8,26,GEORGE,"All he has to do now is count his blessings, say a prayer, and he's"
9,8,27,KRAMER,"Come on, Jerry. How about a-a baggy swimsuit?"
9,8,27,JERRY,"You're not gettin' any skin, Kramer."
9,8,27,KRAMER,"Well, this has all been one big tease!"
9,8,27,"ELAINE,",These proofs look pretty good. Oh. Can I move this? Yup. I think this will work.
9,8,27,"PEGGY,",I'm... gonna get another bottle of water.
9,8,27,"WALTER,","Here, take mine. There's a little left."
9,8,27,"PEGGY,","Oh, thanks, Walter. Ahh!"
9,8,27,"HANKE,","Guys, there's no doubt that the pay"
9,8,28,MAN #1,You get pretty buff forearms.
9,8,28,HANKE,I don't know if I'm into that.
9,8,28,"GEORGE,","Oh, hello, Hanke, others."
9,8,28,HANKE,George.
9,8,28,GEORGE,"You know, Jason, I, uh, I couldn't help notice, I... I didn't get my"
9,8,29,HANKE,Apology? For what?
9,8,29,GEORGE,A drafty apartment? A... sweaterless friend? A ball-game giveaway
9,8,30,HANKE,"George, come on, not that neck hole thing."
9,8,30,GEORGE,"Yeah, the neck hole thing, and I would appreciate it if you would"
9,8,31,HANKE,"No way, you would've completely stretched it out."
9,8,31,GEORGE,You're an alcoholic! You have to apologize. Step Nine! Step Nine.
9,8,31,HANKE,"All right, George, all right. I'm sorry. I'm very, very sorry. I'm so"

9,8,34,KRAMER,"Ah, people in this city are crazy."
9,8,34,"JERRY,",Here ya go.
9,8,34,"KRAMER,","Thanks, buddy. Oh... yes! Hey, you"
9,8,35,JERRY,What?
9,8,35,KRAMER,"Yeah, a different one."
9,8,35,"JERRY,",Oh!

9,8,36,JERRY,"Oh, that's bad. Especially that area."
9,8,36,MELISSA,You got anything to snack on?
9,8,36,JERRY,Uhh...
9,8,36,"MELISSA,","Oh, pickles! Unnhhhh! It's a tough one."

9,8,38,ELAINE,"Peggy, we've got to talk. What is it about me that you find so"
9,8,39,PEGGY,You seem to be with a lot of men.
9,8,39,ELAINE,"What!? I happen to have a very steady boyfriend. You know, I mean,"
9,8,41,PEGGY,"It's not. Good day. Elaine, (leaving the room after rubbing Peggy's keyboard on her butt,"
9,8,44,JERRY,"Well, technically he did apologize."
9,8,44,GEORGE,"Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch. He was"
9,8,45,JERRY,"So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the original"
9,8,46,GEORGE,That's right. I'm two in the hole!
9,8,46,JERRY,"Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She did a full body"
9,8,47,GEORGE,Did you explain to her about the good naked and the bad naked?
9,8,47,JERRY,Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball?
9,8,47,GEORGE,"Well... what if you showed up bad naked, huh? You still got that"
9,8,48,JERRY,Yeah.
9,8,48,"GEORGE,","Well, you on all fours, that thing"

9,8,52,PETERMAN,"Bad news, people. Peggy is home sick."
9,8,52,ELAINE,"Oh, please."
9,8,52,PETERMAN,"She's stuffed up, achy, and suffering from intense malaise."
9,8,52,ELAINE,"Oh, come on, we all have intense malaise. Right?"
9,8,52,PETERMAN,"I just spoke with her, Elaine. She's in bed."
9,8,52,ELAINE,"Yeah, let me tell you something: this is all in her mind, OK? She is"

9,8,55,GEORGE,"Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned about this guy."
9,8,55,SPONSOR,He's doing very well. He's already on to Step Ten.
9,8,55,GEORGE,"Yeah, well when you don't actually do the steps, you can go through"
9,8,56,SPONSOR,Is there some unresolved issue between you and Jason?
9,8,56,GEORGE,I don't know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead of an
9,8,57,SPONSOR,I'm not sure what you want me to do.
9,8,57,GEORGE,"Well, aren't you the boss of him? You shouldn't let him move up!"
9,8,59,SPONSOR,"You're quite upset, George."
9,8,59,GEORGE,"Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two."
9,8,59,SPONSOR,Admit there's a higher power?
9,8,59,GEORGE,"Yeah, let him chew on that for a while."
9,8,59,SPONER,"You know George, I think I can help you. We're having a meeting"

9,8,63,"MELISSA,",What are you doing?
9,8,63,"JERRY,",I found a rough spot on the kitchen
9,8,64,MELISSA,"No, not that. Why are you naked?"
9,8,64,JERRY,I thought naked is good.
9,8,64,"MELISSA,",This isn't good naked.

9,8,64,LEADER,Excuse me. We have a 'no yelling' policy at these meetings.
9,8,64,GEORGE,"Excuse me. Am I talking to you, Pinhead? Am I?!"
9,8,64,LEADER,Please don't call me 'Pinhead'.
9,8,64,GEORGE,I'm losin' it!
9,8,64,"JERRY,",He took you to Rage-aholics? Why?
9,8,64,GEORGE,Probably because this whole Universe is against me!
9,8,64,JERRY,You've got a little rage.
9,8,64,GEORGE,I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes me so mad!
9,8,64,JERRY,"By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work."
9,8,64,GEORGE,This bread has nuts in it!
9,8,64,"JERRY,","Oh, great. Elaine. What is wrong with"
9,8,65,ELAINE,Chicken wing shoulder blades.
9,8,65,JERRY,That's it?
9,8,65,ELAINE,"No, but that's one problem. Why?"
9,8,65,JERRY,"Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day--"
9,8,65,ELAINE,Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good look for a
9,8,66,GEORGE,Why not? It's a good look for a woman.
9,8,66,ELAINE,"Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is"
9,8,67,JERRY,So you don't think it's attractive?
9,8,67,ELAINE,"It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's simian."
9,8,67,GEORGE,"Well, some women like it."
9,8,67,ELAINE,Hmm. Sickies.

9,8,71,PUDDY,Peggy took a turn for the worst.
9,8,71,ELAINE,"Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's still blaming me?"
9,8,71,PUDDY,That's what he said.
9,8,71,ELAINE,I don't believe this woman.
9,8,71,PUDDY,"Talk to me, Babe."
9,8,71,ELAINE,She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick.
9,8,71,PUDDY,"Oh, germ-o-phobe. I know what that's about."
9,8,71,ELAINE,Huh?
9,8,71,ELAINE,What is this symbol?
9,8,71,PUDDY,It's a germ.

9,8,73,PUDDY,Don't you? Elaine.
9,8,73,PUDDY,I know it looks bleak. I've been there. Ten years ago waking up in

9,8,74,PUDDY,I still have trouble looking at those disgusting old bedroom slippers
9,8,75,ELAINE,"Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies."
9,8,75,PUDDY,They're bacteria traps.
9,8,75,PEGGY,So you... just learned to live with it?
9,8,75,PUDDY,For the most part.
9,8,75,ELAINE,
9,8,75,JERRY,So I'm glad we had a talk and worked this out. Don't you feel this is
9,8,76,MELISSA,This is nice.

9,8,80,"KRAMER,",So you broke up?
9,8,80,JERRY,We couldn't carry on a conversation. I kept trying to picture her

9,8,81,JERRY,So what are you up to?
9,8,81,KRAMER,"Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. Hey, how do you"
