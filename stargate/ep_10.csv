0,10,1,TEAL'C,Rya'c! Rya'c!
0,10,3,TEAL'C,Rya'c! Rya'c!
0,10,3,JACK,Teal'c!
0,10,3,TEAL'C,Rya'c!
0,10,3,JANET,"Easy, it's okay now. He's coming around."
0,10,3,TEAL'C,The Goa'uld within me?
0,10,3,JACK,"They had to put junior back in, Teal'c."
0,10,3,JANET,"We almost lost you. The drug didn't work Teal'c, I'm sorry."
0,10,3,DANIEL,"You were calling out something, Rya'c. Does that mean anything?"
0,10,3,TEAL'C,It means nothing.
0,10,5,JANET,"As soon as we removed Teal'c's Goa'uld, his major organs began to shut down and he ran a high fever."
0,10,5,HAMMOND,So the drug failed?
0,10,5,JANET,Yes. But it proves the Goa'uld is Teal'c's immune system. Now if we can learn about it and safely duplicate it's effect we can save lives on Earth.
0,10,5,DANIEL,Without killing Teal'c in the process.
0,10,5,HAMMOND,Well I guess the boys at Langley won't be able to study a Goa'uld after all.
0,10,5,TEAL'C,It is still a possibility.
0,10,5,SAM,"Teal'c, you can't. You don't have an immune system without your Goa'uld. We can't play with your life like that."
0,10,5,TEAL'C,There are many hundreds of Goa'uld larva on Chulak.
0,10,5,HAMMOND,Chulak?
0,10,5,JACK,"Yeah, right. You're kidding, right?"
0,10,5,TEAL'C,It is one of the few worlds in all the galaxy with such an abundance.
0,10,5,DANIEL,"Yeah, but Teal'c, if you recall, last time we were there."
0,10,5,JACK,We had to shoot our way out. Maybe made a bad impression?
0,10,5,HAMMOND,"It's out of the question, I can't authorise it."
0,10,5,TEAL'C,Then I will speak of it no further.
0,10,6,HAMMOND,Dismissed.
0,10,6,DANIEL,What was that?
0,10,6,JACK,I don't know. I'll find out.
0,10,7,JACK,"Mind if I..? Yeah. Look, I'm sorry if I didn't.. You do understand why we can't go back to Chulak, right? They'll get that drug to work long before that thing dies inside of you."
0,10,7,TEAL'C,I am not concerned about my life. I am concerned for the life of my son.
0,10,7,JACK,Your son?
0,10,7,TEAL'C,His name is Rya'c. I have not spoken of him. Or of my wife.
0,10,7,JACK,"You left a family back there? Teal'c, you told. No, you swore to the General you had no ties back there! Why didn't you tell us the truth?"
0,10,7,TEAL'C,A warrior becomes vulnerable if his family is held hostage to the enemy.
0,10,7,JACK,"You didn't think we'd trust you if we knew? Teal'c, how the hell are we supposed to trust you now? Huh? You got any more surprises?"
0,10,7,TEAL'C,"With or without you, O'Neill, I must return to Chulak."
0,10,7,JACK,"Either way it's suicide, my friend."
0,10,7,TEAL'C,"Within days my son will come of age, he will be called to the religious life of our world, he will undergo the ceremony of implantation. The prim'ta. The day when a young boy receives his first Goa'uld symbiote and becomes a true Jaffa, just as all other jaffa before him."
0,10,7,JACK,I take it you don't want that to happen?
0,10,7,TEAL'C,"It is the means by which the Goa'uld enslave the jaffa. I am not the only one among my people who believes this. My first teacher, the jaffa master Bra'tac, he knew very well the Goa'uld are false gods. But I cannot, I will not allow my son to become a slave."
0,10,9,HAMMOND,Absolutely not!
0,10,9,SAM,"With respect, sir, we've considered the risks."
0,10,9,HAMMOND,"You have, have you?"
0,10,9,DANIEL,"Yes, and we are all behind Teal'c, sir."
0,10,9,HAMMOND,I can see that. What I can't see is why.
0,10,9,SAM,We believe there's more to be gained from this mission than a single larval Goa'uld.
0,10,9,HAMMOND,Such as?
0,10,9,DANIEL,"The warrior jaffa class are the foundation of Goa'uld power, they serve as both incubators for their young and as their army. An army made almost invulnerable by the restorative powers of the Goa'uld larva they carry. It's literally as Faustian bargain."
0,10,9,JACK,Teal'c claims there are other jaffa who believe in freedom from the Goa'uld as much as he does.
0,10,9,SAM,"Imagine the strategic advantage, sir, if we could undermine the loyalty of the very group the Goa'uld depend on to maintain their power."
0,10,9,HAMMOND,How many of these other jaffa can you be sure of?
0,10,9,JACK,We're pretty sure of at least one guy.
0,10,9,HAMMOND,One?
0,10,9,DANIEL,"Yes, but where there's one there has to be more than..one."
0,10,9,HAMMOND,"Oh absolutely. Colonel, would you join me in my office a moment?"
0,10,9,JACK,Sure.
0,10,10,HAMMOND,"Shut the door. Have a seat Jack. This is not my first barbeque, Colonel."
0,10,10,JACK,Sir?
0,10,10,HAMMOND,I'd love to get a Goa'uld larva that the lab coats at Langley can study but I don't order my best people on a mission behind enemy lines unless I think it's absolutely necessary.
0,10,10,JACK,I believe it is Sir.
0,10,10,HAMMOND,"Why? There's something you're not telling me Colonel. If you don't want to come clean about the real motivation behind this mission, then fine. The mission is not approved. You will go where I tell you to go."
0,10,10,JACK,"Sir, please.."
0,10,10,HAMMOND,Dismissed!
0,10,10,JACK,"General, Teal'c has a son."
0,10,10,HAMMOND,What did you say?
0,10,10,JACK,Back on Chulak. His kid's about to be implanted with one of those larva things. At a ceremony and Teal'c wants to stop it.
0,10,10,HAMMOND,Why?
0,10,10,JACK,"Why, sir?"
0,10,10,HAMMOND,Teal'c was an enemy soldier. He's compromised.
0,10,10,JACK,"General, he was afraid we wouldn't trust him if we knew he had a family back there. Was he right? When Teal'c saved our lives on Chulak, he gave up his family, sir. Don't you think we owe him something?"
0,10,11,HAMMOND,Teal'c!
0,10,11,JACK,What are you doing?
0,10,11,HAMMOND,Step away from the keyboard.
0,10,11,TEAL'C,I am returning to Chulak for my son.
0,10,11,HAMMOND,No. I'm sorry I can't let you do that.
0,10,11,JACK,"Come on Teal'c, don't do it this way."
0,10,11,TEAL'C,I will risk no one's life but my own. Why will you not let me return?
0,10,11,HAMMOND,"You know far too much about this command, this facility, our defences. I can't let that kind of knowledge fall into enemy hands."
0,10,11,TEAL'C,I will die before allowing that to happen.
0,10,11,HAMMOND,"Dammit Teal'c, that's just what's going to happen if you go through that Gate alone. Which is why I am inclined to authorise a mission to return to Chulak and allow you to bring your son back."
0,10,11,TEAL'C,Thank you General.
0,10,11,HAMMOND,When is this ceremony supposed to happen?
0,10,11,TEAL'C,Within the day.
0,10,12,SAM,Daniel? Glasses.
0,10,12,TEAL'C,O'Neill? I am in your debt.
0,10,12,JACK,"Ah, it's nothing."
0,10,12,TEAL'C,We shall return.
0,10,12,JACK,Ready to ship out sir.
0,10,12,HAMMOND,Godspeed Colonel.
0,10,13,TEAL'C,These are scholars from the court of Apophis. I am to escort them to the temple.
0,10,13,PRIEST,Why do you not show your face my lord?
0,10,13,TEAL'C,My helmet was damaged in combat. It must be repaired.
0,10,13,PRIEST,Perhaps I can help.
0,10,13,TEAL'C,"Nemet, kree! You dare touch me priest? I shall tell Apophis of your vigilance, priest. You shall be rewarded."
0,10,14,TEAL'C,We will go directly to my former home. The ceremony should take place there.
0,10,14,JACK,"All right Teal'c, why don't you show us the way?"
0,10,15,JACK,"Teal'c, is this your..?"
0,10,15,TEAL'C,My former home. A gift from Apophis for many years of service.
0,10,16,DANIEL,What does this mark mean? I don't recognise this.
0,10,16,TEAL'C,This was the home of shol'va.
0,10,16,DANIEL,Traitor.
0,10,16,JACK,Well it looks like this happened a long time ago.
0,10,16,SAM,"Teal'c, there's no reason to believe your wife and son were in the house when this happened."
0,10,16,JACK,"Teal'c, Carter's right. You don't know what's happened here."
0,10,17,BRA'TAC,Obi'tan! Shreec! Shreec! Shreec!
0,10,17,TEAL'C,Tek'matay Bra'tac.
0,10,17,BRA'TAC,Teal'c.
0,10,17,TEAL'C,"It is good to see you, friend."
0,10,17,BRA'TAC,"Were I an enemy, you would be dead."
0,10,17,TEAL'C,My wife and son?
0,10,17,BRA'TAC,"I am told they escaped the burning. I thought you might return in time for your boy's ceremony, Teal'c. Brave, but unwise."
0,10,17,TEAL'C,"If you were awaiting my return, perhaps there are others?"
0,10,17,BRA'TAC,Others don't know you as I do. But I expected you to come alone.
0,10,17,TEAL'C,They are friends. Colonel O'Neill. Captain Carter. Daniel Jackson. Warriors of great skill and cunning.
0,10,17,SAM,"Oh, Teal'c, that's..."
0,10,17,TEAL'C,"My first teacher, Bra'tac. The greatest Jaffa master I have ever known."
0,10,17,JACK,It's an honour to meet you Sir.
0,10,17,BRA'TAC,"You, you are among the warriors who defeated the palace guard at Chulak? A human woman?"
0,10,17,SAM,"Hey, I'll have you know I kicked..."
0,10,18,BRA'TAC,And you? A warrior of great skill and cunning? I could snap you like kindling! How could you bring these hassac with you?
0,10,18,O`NEILL,Hey! Hey! Hey! Who you calling a hassock? What's a hassock?
0,10,18,BRA'TAC,You challenge me hassac?
0,10,18,JACK,"Ah, no. I don't think we came to fight you."
0,10,18,BRA'TAC,A shame.
0,10,19,JACK,"We're here on a mission. If you don't want to be a part of it, just say so."
0,10,19,BRA'TAC,"You choose your friends well Teal'c. Though were I a hundred years younger, it might not have been quite so easy."
0,10,19,JACK,"You're over a hundred years old? God, I'm sorry."
0,10,20,BRA'TAC,A hundred and thirty three.
0,10,20,JACK,You must work out.
0,10,20,BRA'TAC,No one has ever defied the Goa'uld and lived to tell of it. There was much talk in Chulak of the warriors of Earth.
0,10,20,JACK,Really?
0,10,20,TEAL'C,Our time here is limited. Can you take us to find my wife and son?
0,10,20,BRA'TAC,Your family is kreshta. Outcasts. The Kreshta live in a handful of camps outside the city. I do not know which one your family belongs to.
0,10,20,TEAL'C,Then we should begin now.
0,10,20,JACK,Teal'c?
0,10,20,TEAL'C,I will not leave Chulak without seeing my son.
0,10,20,JACK,"Captain, I want you and Daniel to go back to the Stargate, take up positions where you can lay down cover fire."
0,10,20,SAM,Yes sir.
0,10,20,DANIEL,"Ah, a minute ago we were warriors of great skill and cunning."
0,10,20,JACK,"Wait there for us for 24 hours. If we're not back by then, we probably won't be."
0,10,20,SAM,"Yes sir. We'll be waiting. Good luck, sir."
0,10,21,TEAL'C,"If we are discovered, you will be brought before Apophis along with us."
0,10,21,JACK,Well we'll just have to cross that bridge when we come to it.
0,10,21,BRA'TAC,No. The bridge is too well guarded.
0,10,21,JACK,"No, actually there, I was using a cliché that."
0,10,21,TEAL'C,Kal'shak my friend. Honour us with your guidance.
0,10,21,BRA'TAC,We go south. Those camps nearest the city. I believe your wife would go there.
0,10,21,TEAL'C,I agree.
0,10,21,JACK,South is good.
0,10,22,JACK,"Hey Teal'c! Maybe Bra'tac's feeling a little tired, might want to take a little rest."
0,10,22,BRA'TAC,You will follow. Teal'c and I will lead.
0,10,22,JACK,"No, no, no. Actually you see I'm in charge here."
0,10,22,BRA'TAC,"The Stargate is well patrolled. Your deceptions will not work a second time. You need my help to stay alive, human."
0,10,22,JACK,"Yeah, all right. Whatever, I'm easy."
0,10,22,BRA'TAC,Teal'c tells me your world is without gods. Difficult to imagine.
0,10,22,JACK,"Well it's not without gods. A lot of people believe there's a god. Not everyone believes in the same god, the same way but, let's just say nobody believes in anyone with glowing eyes and a snake in his head."
0,10,22,BRA'TAC,Then you serve no one?
0,10,22,JACK,I serve the SGC under a General Hammond.
0,10,22,BRA'TAC,So this Hammond is..
0,10,22,JACK,"Just a man. A very good, very bald man, from Texas."
0,10,23,SAM,Poor Teal'c. What he must have gone through keeping quiet about his family.
0,10,24,DANIEL,Jaffa priests. That's Apophis' emblem.
0,10,24,SAM,What are they carrying?
0,10,25,SAM,What's that?
0,10,25,DANIEL,It's a bell.
0,10,25,SAM,As in a church bell?
0,10,25,DANIEL,Probably.
0,10,25,SAM,Haven't been to church in awhile.
0,10,27,TEAL'C,Priest! Stand aside!
0,10,27,PRIEST,"Teal'c. The traitor.: You dare to show yourself, shol'va?"
0,10,27,TEAL'C,I have no wish to harm you priest. But I will not allow you to perform the primta on my son.
0,10,28,DREY'AUC,Teal'c.
0,10,29,JACK,And this would be?
0,10,29,TEAL'C,My wife. Drey'auc.
0,10,29,DREY'AUC,I had to beg the priest to perform the ceremony. They bought the tablet and the tent for the primta all the way to camp. Why have you returned?
0,10,29,TEAL'C,"My son will not be a slave, Drey'auc. He will taste freedom as I have."
0,10,29,DREY'AUC,"Freedom Teal'c? You have condemned your son to death.Your heresy is an abomination, Teal'c. Even by the outcasts I am shunned."
0,10,29,TEAL'C,The abomination is my people enslaved by the Goa'uld.
0,10,29,DREY'AUC,"How can you call the gods that you served for so long, your enemy?"
0,10,29,TEAL'C,Since the Earth people opened my eyes. Primta is slavery.
0,10,29,DREY'AUC,Did you see where I am raising your son? Is this better than the home Apophis granted you as first prime?
0,10,29,TEAL'C,It is not.
0,10,29,DREY'AUC,You have abandoned and betrayed us. Do you know what I have endured to convince the priests we are still loyal? They were about to lift the banishment so we could return to the city!
0,10,29,TEAL'C,So you want this more for yourself than for our son?
0,10,30,TEAL'C,I will speak to him.
0,10,30,DREY'AUC,"No, no. He believes you are dead!"
0,10,30,TEAL'C,Dead?
0,10,30,DREY'AUC,It is easier than the truth.
0,10,30,TEAL'C,What have you told him woman?
0,10,30,DREY'AUC,"What would you have me tell him? That his father left his son for people he does not know? Who are not his blood? You tell him that, husband, witness the dishonour in his eyes."
0,10,30,TEAL'C,Drey'auc.
0,10,30,DREY'AUC,Come. Carry your son back to the hovel that has become his home.
0,10,31,SAM,We have to get a closer look.
0,10,32,TEAL'C,Rya'c? Rya'c?
0,10,32,RYA'C,Father? I knew he was not dead.
0,10,32,TEAL'C,How long has the sickness been in him?
0,10,32,DREY'AUC,Since we were driven from our home. Do you understand now? Without the healing powers of the Goa'uld he will die.
0,10,32,TEAL'C,What have I done?
0,10,32,JACK,How's he doing Teal'c?
0,10,32,TEAL'C,He is dying.
0,10,32,JACK,"I'm no doctor, but I know scarlet fever when I see it."
0,10,32,TEAL'C,Can it be treated by your Earth medicines?
0,10,32,JACK,"There's some vaccines, antibiotics. Come here."
0,10,33,JACK,Give that to him.
0,10,33,DREY'AUC,I thank you.
0,10,33,JACK,It won't cure him you know. It'll take more powerful drugs than I've got with me.
0,10,33,TEAL'C,What of your Earth doctors?
0,10,33,JACK,"If we get him through the Stargate, maybe."
0,10,34,DANIEL,Bingo. Goa'uld larva.
0,10,34,SAM,"Here in the open like this, no guards?"
0,10,34,DANIEL,Well who on Chulak needs to steal one?
0,10,34,SAM,We do.
0,10,34,DANIEL,Right.
0,10,34,SAM,"Okay, we can do this."
0,10,34,DANIEL,I'm ready.
0,10,34,SAM,"Okay. On three. One, two, three."
0,10,35,DANIEL,"Okay, on four."
0,10,35,SAM,Four. She grabs a symbiote and puts it into the flask
0,10,35,SAM,"I really, really, really hate these things.Okay, come on."
0,10,36,SAM,Daniel? What are you thinking?
0,10,36,DANIEL,Just that every single one of these infant Goa'uld's will one day take a human life. And all I have to do is..
0,10,36,SAM,"If we kill them when they are as vulnerable as they are right now, we'd be no better than the Goa'uld. Let's go."
0,10,38,DREY'AUC,He is burning.
0,10,38,JACK,Carter and Daniel should be here.
0,10,38,DREY'AUC,He no longer draws breath Teal'c.
0,10,38,TEAL'C,Rya'c. Rya'c.
0,10,38,JACK,We should try to make it to the Stargate.
0,10,38,TEAL'C,By then it will be too late. There is another way.
0,10,38,DREY'AUC,"No, no,no."
0,10,38,JACK,"Teal'c, you wanna think about this? You can't live for more than a couple of hours without that thing."
0,10,38,BRA'TAC,It is a father's right.
0,10,38,DREY'AUC,What of you Teal'c?
0,10,38,TEAL'C,I am sorry my son that it is I who must do this to you. But I do it to save your life.
0,10,39,TEAL'C,"Forgive me, my son. Forgive me."
0,10,40,DANIEL,Do you think these things need to be fed?
0,10,41,SAM,"Go, go"
0,10,41,DANIEL,What the hell do we do now?
0,10,41,SAM,Drop and cover your head. This is gonna be close.
0,10,42,DANIEL,Well that was insane.
0,10,42,SAM,Let's get back to the Stargate.
0,10,43,SAM,Colonel?
0,10,43,JACK,"Keep coming Captain, you're almost here."
0,10,43,BRA'TAC,The Goa'uld within him is strong. He's healing well.
0,10,43,JACK,When will he be strong enough to travel?
0,10,43,TEAL'C,"Soon. But by then, O'Neill, I will no longer be. Bra'tac. I would have you hear my will."
0,10,44,JACK,Well let's just put a hold on that right now.
0,10,44,SAM,We'd better get moving sir.
0,10,44,JACK,We've got a little problem. Teal'c's kid was too sick to make it to the Stargate so he gave him his own Goa'uld to keep him alive.
0,10,44,DANIEL,"Ahh, we have one."
0,10,44,JACK,What?
0,10,44,DANIEL,We were gonna take it back with us.. but.
0,10,44,DREY'AUC,"Praise the stars, we must hurry."
0,10,44,SAM,We found what looks like a monastry.
0,10,44,BRA'TAC,You dare steal from the seplica of the temple?
0,10,44,DREY'AUC,It is sacrilige!
0,10,44,JACK,Well so what! Is it gonna help him?
0,10,45,BRA'TAC,It is young. Not yet ready for implantation. But we will try.
0,10,46,PRIEST,Go!
0,10,47,JACK,How you holding up Teal'c?
0,10,47,TEAL'C,My body grows strong again
0,10,47,BRA'TAC,We have been discovered.
0,10,47,RYA'C,Father?
0,10,47,TEAL'C,Rya'c.
0,10,47,DREY'AUC,Your father has given you life.
0,10,47,RYA'C,A Goa'uld?
0,10,47,TEAL'C,In a primta. It is all I can give you until I return. Follow the guidance of Bra'tac and your mother. And you will learn to become a great warrior.
0,10,47,RYA'C,Stay.
0,10,47,TEAL'C,I cannot. But the day of my return will come.
0,10,47,RYA'C,When?
0,10,47,TEAL'C,"It may be a very long time, my son. But the life of a jaffa is long. I know the day will come when we will stand side by side in battle to free our people from the false gods. Remember my son, remember."
0,10,48,TEAL'C,Blame me for the priest. Tell them I tried to steal your son away.
0,10,48,DREY'AUC,We will be all right Teal'c. Go.
0,10,48,TEAL'C,My son is fortunate to have such a mother.
0,10,48,DREY'AUC,And his father will not return to free his people if he does not..go now.
0,10,48,JACK,"Teal'c, we gotta move."
0,10,49,JACK,"All right, here's the plan."
0,10,49,BRA'TAC,You will do as I say.
0,10,49,JACK,Right.
0,10,49,BRA'TAC,You won't need those.
0,10,50,BRA'TAC,Behold my friends. The traitors.
0,10,50,PRIEST,Halt. Come no further.
0,10,50,BRA'TAC,I am to present my prisoners to Apophis himself.
0,10,50,PRIEST,You cannot pass Bra'tac.
0,10,50,BRA'TAC,You know of me?
0,10,50,PRIEST,Of course master. You were once the greatest jaffa warrior of all. But no one may pass until the palace guard arrives.
0,10,50,BRA'TAC,I understand. Then we wait.
0,10,51,BRA'TAC,Not bad for a man of 133.
