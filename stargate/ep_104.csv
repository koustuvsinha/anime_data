0,104,0,"""THE WARRIOR""",By Peter DeLuise
0,104,1,KYTANO,"My name is Kytano. The once First Prime of Imhotep. A false God. A false God who has died by my own hand. Now I am free. I am a free Jaffa. If you have come to this place, then you wish to know freedom as I do. If you have come to hear me, then you know in your heart and your mind that the Goa'uld are not gods."
0,104,1,ALL,Yeah!
0,104,1,KYTANO,"Still, I am but one warrior. Only together, we are an army of warriors"
0,104,1,MAN,An army has weapons. An army has food.
0,104,1,KYTANO,"In time we shall have weapons and enough food and drink to sustain us for as long as it takes to achieve victory. Until then, we have our freedom. We have our brother and sisters. I do not say that this will be easy. There will be sacrifice. But for each of you who dies in the name of freedom, your souls will be sent to Kheb. The place of freedom everlasting. Until then, if you seek freedom, if you seek sanctuary, know that this place is sanctuary. This is Kelmar."
0,104,1,ALL,Yeah!!
0,104,1,KYTANO,I declare this world a free world for all jaffa. Let no Goa'uld challenge us. The time has come for jaffa to claim their rightful place among the stars. As warriors who live and as warriors who die free!
0,104,2,BRA'TAC,What say you Teal'c? Is he not the means of our deliverance?
0,104,3,O'NEILL,Deliverance? Do you have any idea what happened to the guys in that movie?
0,104,3,BRA'TAC,I do not.
0,104,3,HAMMOND,"Master Bra'tac, that's a very strong recommendation."
0,104,3,BRA'TAC,Yet the rewards of such an alliance would be great.
0,104,3,HAMMOND,Teal'c?
0,104,3,TEAL'C,Many of our allies have fallen General Hammond. The Tollan may be gone forever. The Tok'ra are severely weakened. Kytano offers an army.
0,104,3,CARTER,An army that needs our help.
0,104,3,TEAL'C,"Major Carter, have the jaffa not helped your cause?"
0,104,3,CARTER,"Teal'c, please don't misunderstand me. You and Bra'tac have done more for us than anyone could have asked. I owe you both my life at least a dozen times over, that's not what I'm saying."
0,104,4,DANIEL,Wait a minute. I don't think we should underestimate this opportunity. An army of jaffa actually challenging the power structure of the Goa'uld. It could be an inspiration to every jaffa out there. Word of it's very existence is a threat to the Goa'uld.
0,104,4,CARTER,You don't think the Goa'uld are just going to sit around and let it happen?
0,104,4,TEAL'C,We do not. Which makes Kytano's need so great.
0,104,4,BRA'TAC,His army has grown from many different System Lords. And more flock to him with each raid he makes. But an army cannot live on courage alone.
0,104,4,HAMMOND,"Dr Jackson, what can you tell us about this Imhotep? This is the first I've heard of him."
0,104,4,DANIEL,"Well, during the third dynasty of ancient Egypt, Imhotep was credited as being the first pyramid builder. He was later deified amongst the ancient Egyptians but amongst the Goa'uld as least as far as I know he never achieved power of any kind."
0,104,4,HAMMOND,He was never a System Lord?
0,104,4,DANIEL,In fact I think Imhotep was probably an insignificant Goa'uld from a backwater planet.
0,104,4,CARTER,Which explains how Kytano's managed to survive.
0,104,4,O'NEILL,He took out a nobody.
0,104,4,DANIEL,"Which probably only buys us some time. If we don't help, the Goa'uld will eventually see this as the threat it really is."
0,104,4,BRA'TAC,Imhotep may have been a minor Goa'uld but Kytano is a great leader of men. I believe him bold enough to lead his rebel army to victory over those who would deny us freedom.
0,104,4,HAMMOND,I've already ordered food and medical supplies prepared for transport. What we need to discuss in more detail is what kind of weapons and how many.
0,104,4,BRA'TAC,Your projectile weapons have proven to be effective in battle.
0,104,4,O'NEILL,"P90's, MP5's, Spaz 12's."
0,104,4,BRA'TAC,For several hundred warriors.
0,104,4,HAMMOND,That may take some doing.
0,104,4,TEAL'C,"General Hammond. If we may send a smaller number of weapons, as a gesture of good intentions."
0,104,4,O'NEILL,I think we owe these folks. To a point.
0,104,4,HAMMOND,Very well. You have a go.
0,104,5,BRA'TAC,"O'Neill. Before we leave. You should know that some of the jaffa you are about to meet, you may have met before. In battle."
0,104,5,O'NEILL,Yeah. I thought about that.
0,104,5,BRA'TAC,Jaffa have long memories.
0,104,5,O'NEILL,"Well that's all right, because I don't. That's a joke."
0,104,6,HAMMOND,Master Bra'tac. Lets hope your faith in this man is well deserved.
0,104,6,BRA'TAC,I would stake my life on it.
0,104,7,O'NEILL,"Ours too, apparently."
0,104,9,BRA'TAC,I am Master BRA'TAC of Chulak. I have come with warriors of the Tau'ri.
0,104,10,O'NEILL,Hi guys.
0,104,10,BRA'TAC,Tek ma tek.
0,104,10,DANIEL,It means friends well meant. He's saying we come in peace.
0,104,11,TEAL'C,Raknor.
0,104,11,RAKNOR,Teal'c. Tek ma tek. It was Teal'c who gave me my first taste of freedom. It is because of you I am here. Tek ma tay.
0,104,11,DANIEL,Tek ma tay is a greeting of respect.
0,104,11,O'NEILL,Okay.
0,104,11,DANIEL,I'm just saying.
0,104,11,O'NEILL,I don't care.
0,104,11,DANIEL,Okay.
0,104,11,RAKNOR,"These are among the great warriors of the Tau'ri. Daniel Jackson, Major Carter and their leader Colonel O'Neill. Tek ma tek."
0,104,11,O'NEILL,Back atcha.
0,104,11,RAKNOR,Back atcha. You have come to speak to Kytano.
0,104,11,BRA'TAC,We have.
0,104,11,RAKNOR,He is on a mission and will return very soon. What is this?
0,104,11,TEAL'C,The first shipment of many.
0,104,11,O'NEILL,"We brought food, supplies and last, Carter?"
0,104,12,O'NEILL,Weapons.
0,104,13,O'NEILL,What?
0,104,13,RAKNOR,"Your gesture is appreciated but they had hoped you would bring staff weapons, zat'nik'tels, true weapons."
0,104,13,O'NEILL,True weapons?
0,104,13,RAKNOR,It does not matter friend. Come; see how our numbers are growing
0,104,14,BRA'TAC,"You see, O'Neill. These jaffa were once sworn, mortal enemies. Each serving different false gods. Now they work in harmony."
0,104,14,RAKNOR,Our numbers grow with each successful campaign.
0,104,14,CARTER,"And you just trust every new arrival to your cause? I'm just saying, isn't it possible that some of these jaffa are still loyal to their gods and are acting as spies within your ranks?"
0,104,14,BRA'TAC,A warrior of Kytano's experience can see within the very soul of another jaffa and know his allegiance.
0,104,14,O'NEILL,Kind of a leap of faith isn't it?
0,104,14,DANIEL,No more than when we trusted Bra'tac when Teal'c went through the Rite of Mal'shuraan.
0,104,14,BRA'TAC,I saw into his heart and knew he no longer worshipped Apophis.
0,104,14,O'NEILL,"That's not quite the same, is it?"
0,104,14,BRA'TAC,"Our ways are different to you, O'Neill. Accept that."
0,104,14,RAKNOR,The discipline is called mustaba. All of Imhotep's jaffa were required to master it. And now we require it of ourselves.
0,104,15,TEAL'C,Mashak. Training staffs.
0,104,15,RAKNOR,Out of necessity Teal'c. There are not enough staff weapons for all.
0,104,15,BRA'TAC,You overcommit.
0,104,16,RAKNOR,This young warriors name is Tara'c.
0,104,17,TARA'C,"Tek ma tay, master."
0,104,17,BRA'TAC,"If you would allow me? Your weapon is balanced but the warrior is not. When one overcommits, one becomes vulnerable to counterattack. When one achieves balance in combat, one will survive to achieve balance in life."
0,104,17,RAKNOR,"Forgive me master, but Kytano teaches that one must strike with single-minded purpose towards victory without regard for one's survival."
0,104,17,BRA'TAC,Show me.
0,104,18,O'NEILL,"Hey, easy, easy, easy."
0,104,18,BRA'TAC,Leave them O`Neill.
0,104,19,O'NEILL,Hey!
0,104,20,O'NEILL,What the hell are you doing?
0,104,20,TARA'C,We are training.
0,104,20,O'NEILL,"Where I come from, it's called beating the crap out of each other."
0,104,20,TEAL'C,"The boy's symbiote will heal his injuries, O'Neill."
0,104,20,RAKNOR,"Kytano teaches that we must be willing to die, as he is if we are to be free."
0,104,20,O'NEILL,"Well if you all die, you won't have an army. That's kind of stupid."
0,104,20,TARA'C,Tek ma tay key!
0,104,21,O'NEILL,"Whoa! Hey, what!"
0,104,21,TEAL'C,You insulted our ways O'Neill. He is challenging you.
0,104,21,TARA'C,Tek ma te.
0,104,21,O'NEILL,"Yeah, easy stick boy. All right I'm just here to help."
0,104,21,MAN,Kytano returns!
0,104,22,O'NEILL,Where you going?
0,104,24,O'NEILL,"You know, we never get this when we get home."
0,104,25,KYTANO,"Jaffa. This day, three of our warriors have fallen in the name of freedom. They fought fiercely against Zipacna's forces. And they died bravely. And have secured a place for themselves in Kheb. So too have they strengthened our ability to fight back at the enemy."
0,104,26,ALL,Yeah!
0,104,26,O'NEILL,True weapons.
0,104,26,KYTANO,Tek mal te'uc.
0,104,27,BRA'TAC,Tek ma tay.
0,104,27,KYTANO,"You flatter me Master Bra'tac. Ya re a roo kek a nak. I honour he who would kill his God. And to his brethren of the Tau'ri. Slayers of Ra, Hathor, Setesh, Heru'ur, Sokar, Cronos and Apophis."
0,104,27,O'NEILL,"Well, somebody's been keeping score. Colonel Jack O'Neill."
0,104,27,KYTANO,A familiar name. Cursed by every Goa'uld. Imhotep himself declared your days were numbered.
0,104,27,O'NEILL,Well that's fine. As long as it's a very big number.
0,104,27,KYTANO,Because of you the armies of these fallen System Lords now swell the ranks of our rebellion.
0,104,27,O'NEILL,Tak ma tak Kytano. We also offer an alliance.
0,104,27,KYTANOL,Then you are most welcome.
0,104,28,KYTANO,Glorious.
0,104,29,O'NEILL,"And of course, weapons."
0,104,30,KYTANO,"Earth weapons? Take no offence, my friend, but your weapons are primitive by comparison."
0,104,30,O'NEILL,"Carter, I think a little demonstration is in order, don't you?"
0,104,31,CARTER,"This weapon is called a P90. It carries a 50 round, top loading magazine of teflon coated ordinance with a cyclical rate of fire of 900 rounds per minute."
0,104,32,KYTANO,Raknor is among our best marksmen.
0,104,32,O'NEILL,"Carter, that target, what, sixty, seventy yards out?"
0,104,32,CARTER,"Give or take, Sir."
0,104,32,O'NEILL,"Fire away, son."
0,104,33,KYTANO,"Well done. Tai, kree."
0,104,33,O'NEILL,"Two out of three, that's not bad. Carter?"
0,104,33,KYTANO,The female?
0,104,33,TEAL'C,Major Carter is a formidable warrior.
0,104,33,KYTANO,"Yes, of course."
0,104,33,O'NEILL,"Actually, hold up a second. Hey, you. In the skirt. Get that target swinging a little. Little more. All right, step away. When ready, Major."
0,104,34,O'NEILL,"Ah, Major, demonstrate the weapon on single shot."
0,104,36,O'NEILL,This is a weapon of terror. It's made to intimidate the enemy. This is a weapon of war; it's made to kill your enemy.
0,104,36,CARTER,And it's capable of doing so at five times the range I just demonstrated.
0,104,36,O'NEILL,"We've used it to win about every skirmish we've had with the Goa'uld and with the jaffa who served them. Those of you who have gone up against us and survived, and you know who you are; you know what I'm talking about."
0,104,36,KYTANO,We accept your gifts with gratitude and humility. Now let us celebrate this new alliance.
0,104,37,O'NEILL,"They really like doing that, don't they?"
0,104,37,CARTER,Yes sir.
0,104,37,KYTANO,"Your weapons are formidable, yes but they lack the endurance of a staff."
0,104,37,CARTER,That's what these are for.
0,104,38,KYTANO,And you will provide them freely?
0,104,38,DANIEL,"That's the purpose of an alliance, isn't it?"
0,104,38,KYTANO,It places you in a position of power over us.
0,104,38,O'NEILL,How so?
0,104,38,TEAL'C,"If Kytano does not do exactly as agreed, you may withhold ammunition."
0,104,38,O'NEILL,"Okay, first of all, Teal'c, as long as you're a member of SG1, you should use the pronoun we not you. Secondly, we're not holding back, we're offering the best we've got. Now you can either take it or leave it."
0,104,38,KYTANO,"Of course, it is only concern for my people that I raise these questions."
0,104,38,O'NEILL,Your people?
0,104,38,KYTANO,There is no warrior among us who cannot say my people.
0,104,38,TEAL'C,As I also have done.
0,104,38,KYTANO,Colonel O'Neill fears I will seek power for myself.
0,104,38,CARTER,Well you are gathering an army.
0,104,38,KYTANO,And I lead. But there is no warrior among us who cannot claim jor may sayku.
0,104,38,DANIEL,Challenge of leadership.
0,104,38,TEAL'C,To determine the worthiness of the victor and his right to lead.
0,104,38,O'NEILL,"To the death, I suppose?"
0,104,38,KYTANO,Of course.
0,104,38,O'NEILL,"Of course. Yeah, well where I come from, we do things a little differently."
0,104,38,KYTANO,And you would have us change our ways to suit yours?
0,104,38,O'NEILL,I didn't say that. But if it's not too much trouble.
0,104,38,BRA'TAC,"Kytano. Colonel O'Neill. It is my hope that we can learn from our differences. That they bond us together, make us stronger."
0,104,38,KYTANO,Your words are wise Master Bra'tac.
0,104,38,O'NEILL,"Yes, wise indeed."
0,104,38,KYTANO,"Tomorrow, we will bond. In battle. You are familiar with the System Lord, Nirrti?"
0,104,38,O'NEILL,Oh yeah.
0,104,38,KYTANO,Tomorrow we are going to raid a supply shipment intended for a battalion of Nirrti's jaffa. Join us.
0,104,38,O'NEILL,"If we do, what's in it for us?"
0,104,38,KYTANO,"I see you are one who speaks his mind, O'Neill."
0,104,38,O'NEILL,"Yes, which is why I don't say much."
0,104,39,KYTANO,A share of the spoils.
0,104,39,O'NEILL,Spoils are good. We like spoils.
0,104,39,KYTANO,Teal'c has informed me that you require several hours of sleep. There is no shame in doing so.
0,104,40,O'NEILL,"Gee, thanks."
0,104,41,TEAL'C,Shal met.
0,104,41,RAKNOR,"Shal met. Have you chosen to join us, Teal'c."
0,104,41,TEAL'C,Kytano has yet to ask.
0,104,41,RAKNOR,He will. You will take your place as a leader in the jaffa nation.
0,104,41,TEAL'C,I have long dreamed that jaffa would one day be free. But I free that day is farther off than Kytano believes.
0,104,41,RAKNOR,We have come so far because of you Teal'c. Kytano could not have hoped to raise such an army had you not led the way.
0,104,41,TEAL'C,Perhaps.
0,104,41,RAKNOR,And we will grow even stronger now that the tau'ri have become our allies.
0,104,41,TEAL'C,Of that I am not so sure. Kytano's ways are difficult for the people of the Tau'ri to understand.
0,104,42,KYTANO,We shall gain our freedom with or without them.
0,104,43,TEAL'C,Kytano. Forgive me.
0,104,43,KYTANO,There is nothing to forgive.
0,104,43,TEAL'C,I do not speak for O'Neill.
0,104,43,KYTANO,"What you say is true, they are different. Cynical of our ways. O'Neill most of all."
0,104,43,TEAL'C,Yet they are my friends.
0,104,43,KYTANO,"And we are your brothers. I am not a fool Teal'c, I know the Tau'ri are strong. An alliance can make us stronger. But I abandon nothing of who and what we are for neither human nor Goa'uld."
0,104,44,O'NEILL,I guess Teal'c's staying out all night with his new buddies?
0,104,44,DANIEL,Well he did get in all that quality kel'no'reeming.
0,104,44,O'NEILL,What do you think?
0,104,44,CARTER,Of Kytano? Well you've got to admit he's got presence. His followers are almost fanatical.
0,104,44,O'NEILL,Almost?
0,104,44,DANIEL,Well it does make him formidable. Ancient Japanese feudal Lords recognised the discipline that incorporated indifference to death as a very effective tool in battle.
0,104,44,O'NEILL,What's with this jomo sicko thing anyway?
0,104,44,DANIEL,Jor may seyku.
0,104,44,O'NEILL,Like anybody in that crowd's gonna challenge him.
0,104,44,CARTER,Kytano's managed to collect jaffa from at least six different System Lords. He must be doing something right.
0,104,44,O'NEILL,"Well, they have no problem with dying. I have a problem with that."
0,104,44,DANIEL,You have a problem with them dying or you got a problem with the fact that they don't have a problem with it.
0,104,44,O'NEILL,Both. I think.
0,104,45,O'NEILL,Get some sleep. We have to bond in the morning.
0,104,46,KYTANO,Kree! You are surrounded! Relinquish your weapons!
0,104,48,O'NEILL,Hey!
0,104,48,RAKNOR,He does not know fear.
0,104,48,O'NEILL,Well he knows stupid.
0,104,49,KYTANO,"Kel mak. Hold your fire. I am Kytano. If you have heard that name, then you know that there are other jaffa who believe that the Goa'uld are false gods. Join us in the struggle against our oppressors and live to see freedom."
0,104,50,KYTANO,"If you do not believe in freedom for our people brother, then shoot me now."
0,104,51,TEAL'C,"Do you believe in him now, O'Neill?"
0,104,52,O'NEILL,"Teal'c. You see, I'm a little concerned about Kytano."
0,104,52,TEAL'C,Explain.
0,104,52,O'NEILL,"Well you know, that stunt he just pulled."
0,104,52,TEAL'C,Kytano is driven by the power of his beliefs.
0,104,52,O'NEILL,His beliefs are very impressive but his tactics could have gotten us all killed.
0,104,52,TEAL'C,Kytano was successful.
0,104,52,O'NEILL,I say he got lucky.
0,104,52,TEAL'C,Then it appears we disagree.
0,104,53,TEAL'C,Kytano summons us.
0,104,54,CARTER,Sir?
0,104,54,O'NEILL,We've got a problem with Teal'c. He's buying into Kytano's act.
0,104,54,CARTER,"You don't really think it's an act, do you? Kytano certainly believes in his cause."
0,104,54,O'NEILL,I think Kytano believes he could walk on water.
0,104,55,KYTANO,The fruits of our new born alliance.
0,104,55,RAKNOR,The cutting edge that is the sword of our rebellion.
0,104,55,CARTER,"Weapons grade naqahdah, sir. A lot of it."
0,104,55,O'NEILL,It's quite a haul.
0,104,55,KYTANO,Yes.
0,104,55,O'NEILL,What are you gonna do with it?
0,104,55,KYTANO,"I will give you as much is as fair. I have plans for the rest. As for the zat'nik'tels, we require them all. I will be able to offer you many times as much once the ha'tak arrives."
0,104,55,DANIEL,You're expecting a mothership?
0,104,55,KYTANO,"You chose your allies well. I have just received news that jaffa, loyal to me are staging a mutiny as we speak aboard a powerful mothership. Soon they will be on their way and unite with us in our cause."
0,104,55,O'NEILL,A mutiny? That's a little risky. Isn't it?
0,104,55,KYTANO,There are always risks in war.
0,104,55,O'NEILL,But if they fail....
0,104,55,KYTANO,They will succeed because their cause is just.
0,104,55,O'NEILL,I wish it worked that way.
0,104,55,KYTANO,Then they will succeed with the strength of their resolve. Come with me to the Chaapa'ai. See for yourself. Come.
0,104,56,KYTANO,Nirrti must not learn of our raid. She would surely hunt us down. We must cover our tracks.
0,104,57,KYTANO,"Tara'c. I chose you to lead this squad of brave warriors because I know you will not fail me. Know that if you are struck down in battle, you will live forever in Kheb. Free from Goa'uld oppression for all time."
0,104,59,KYTANO,Fight your way as deeply as you can into Nirrti's force. Show the your resolve. Kal lak shal ta.
0,104,59,TARA'C,Kal lak shal ta.
0,104,59,DANIEL,Victory or death.
0,104,60,CARTER,"Sir, that's a naqahdah enhanced bomb."
0,104,60,DANIEL,He's sending them on a suicide mission.
0,104,60,TARA'C,Jaffa! Kree!
0,104,60,O'NEILL,"Hey, wait a minute!"
0,104,62,O'NEILL,What the hell are you doing?
0,104,62,KYTANO,Do you now see the strength of our resolve?
0,104,62,O'NEILL,I see the strength of your arrogance.
0,104,62,KYTANO,Do not interfere with things you know nothing about.
0,104,62,O'NEILL,Oh I know exactly what you're about.
0,104,62,KYTANO,We are at war. It is our way.
0,104,62,O'NEILL,And I suppose it makes you feel all powerful to know how eager those boys are to die for you?
0,104,62,KYTANO,Their souls are on the way to a far better place.
0,104,62,O'NEILL,"You know, I've heard that before."
0,104,62,KYTANO,You would deny the existence of Kheb? You would deny that their souls would find paradise?
0,104,62,DANIEL,"I think what Colonel O'Neill is trying to say is, we do things a little differently."
0,104,62,KYTANO,Yet again you remind me that your ways are different. We should abandon centuries of jaffa tradition and follow the ways of the Tau'ri. Which of us is arrogant?
0,104,62,DANIEL,"Look if we're gonna have an alliance here, we're have to find common ground."
0,104,62,KYTANO,Soon the ha'tak we await will come and this army will be a true force to be reckoned with. If you wish to ally yourselves with that force then accept us for who and what we are. If not then leave us now. Teal'c.
0,104,64,KYTANO,Expect resistance here and here.
0,104,64,TEAL'C,Daniel Jackson witnessed the System Lord Yu being stabbed by Osiris.
0,104,64,KYTANO,"With his sarcophagus, he survived. Still he was severely weakened by the attack. His homeworld is ripe for the taking if his personal guard can be eliminated. Now is the time when Lord Yu will be most vulnerable."
0,104,64,BRA'TAC,Then now is time to strike.
0,104,64,TEAL'C,Indeed.
0,104,64,KYTANO,I have several loyal jaffa among his court. Many of his jaffa will join us if he were to be struck down.
0,104,64,TEAL'C,
0,104,64,BRA'TAC,Ships filled with jaffa ready to flock to our cause. I have dreamed of it but I never thought it possible.
0,104,65,O'NEILL,Teal'c? We're packing up. I'd like you to come with us.
0,104,65,KYTANO,His place is here.
0,104,65,O'NEILL,Teal'c?
0,104,65,TEAL'C,Kytano has entrusted me with a mission of great importance.
0,104,65,O'NEILL,I bet he has.
0,104,65,TEAL'C,I have accepted this mission freely.
0,104,65,O'NEILL,Don't do it.
0,104,65,TEAL'C,"Lord Yu's stargate will be unguarded. The plan is bold enough to succeed, O'Neill. More so if you join us."
0,104,65,O'NEILL,Can't do it.
0,104,66,O'NEILL,Why him?
0,104,66,KYTANO,Teal'c's participation will guarantee the success of this mission.
0,104,66,O'NEILL,"On the other hand, Teal'c is a leader in his own right. You might not want him around."
0,104,66,KYTANO,Teal'c will become one of our greatest warriors.
0,104,66,O'NEILL,If he lives.
0,104,66,KYTANO,He will succeed.
0,104,66,O'NEILL,Because you say so?
0,104,66,KYTANO,Because he is Teal'c.
0,104,66,O'NEILL,"All right, let me see if I can get this straight. You assassinate one System Lord after another, you take all their ships and warriors, all of whom are willing to die for you. And this is different from the way things are now.... How?"
0,104,66,KYTANO,The jaffa will be free.
0,104,66,O'NEILL,To follow you?
0,104,66,KYTANO,I grow tired of this. It is time.
0,104,67,O'NEILL,Teal'c? I'm not going to recommend an alliance. Not as long as he's in charge.
0,104,67,TEAL'C,We will speak of this when I return O'Neill.
0,104,67,O'NEILL,"I don't think so. Because if you do this, I don't think you're coming back."
0,104,67,TEAL'C,"When I return victorious, will you reconsider."
0,104,67,O'NEILL,Tough call.
0,104,67,TEAL'C,Trust in me O'Neill.
0,104,68,TEAL'C,All of you.
0,104,68,KYTANO,Teal'c. You are strong and you are wise. Upon your return you shall be my second in command.
0,104,70,YU,"Teal'c. Perhaps I am not as weak as you were led to believe. My jaffa has brought you before me because I wanted it so. Kytano has sent you to kill me. Your faith is not blind. I know this of you. I am going to offer you your life. I will even allow you to return to your rebel army. But first, there is something you must know."
0,104,71,BRA'TAC,O'Neill. You will not reconsider?
0,104,71,KYTANO,"As Bra'tac said, we are stronger together. Can we put aside our petty differences?"
0,104,71,O'NEILL,"I'm holding you personally responsible for whatever happens to Teal'c. Carter, dial us out of here."
0,104,71,CARTER,Yes sir.
0,104,73,CARTER,"Incoming, Sir."
0,104,75,CARTER,Teal'c.
0,104,75,DANIEL,What happened?
0,104,76,O'NEILL,Thanks for the update.
0,104,77,TEAL'C,Deceiver! We have been deceived. Deceiver!
0,104,78,KYTANO,I have deceived no one. The ha'tak I spoke of is just now entering the system. When it arrives all will become clear.
0,104,78,TEAL'C,Lord Yu knows Kelmar is the location of this rebel army. He knows our numbers. He knows you have betrayed him. The mutiny on board Lord Yu's ship has failed. The ha'tak you await brings doom. Not salvation. The System Lords merely bided their time to root out all rebel jaffa so they may be crushed in one all out attack. The betrayer has been betrayed. Jor may seyku.
0,104,78,KYTANO,You challenge me?
0,104,78,TEAL'C,Jor may seyku!
0,104,78,KYTANO,Very well.
0,104,80,BRA'TAC,"If you intervene, the challenge will be forfeit."
0,104,81,KYTANO,Perhaps you think I will spare you?
0,104,81,TEAL'C,This is a fight to the death. Your death.
0,104,81,KYTANO,Shol'va!
0,104,82,KYTANO,Is that the best you can do?
0,104,83,KYTANO,Beg for mercy.
0,104,83,TEAL'C,I die free.
0,104,84,KYTANO,You die at the hand of your god. Imhotep.
0,104,85,KYTANO,Arrggghhh.
0,104,87,RAKNOR,He is not jaffa. Kytano is not jaffa!
0,104,87,TEAL'C,He was a goa'uld. The goa'uld Imhotep.
0,104,87,DANIEL,He used the jaffa's desire for freedom against them. Probably the only way he could gain any real power.
0,104,88,TEAL'C,Kytano was a lie. What brought us to Kelmar is not. Lord Yu's ship will attack at any moment. Follow us. Leave with us if you wish to live.
0,104,88,BRA'TAC,Follow Teal'c. He speaks the truth.
0,104,88,RAKNOR,And he has won the right. You all witnessed. Kytano has been beaten in the rite of jor may seyku. Teal'c is our rightful leader now.
0,104,89,O'NEILL,Carter?
0,104,89,CARTER,Way ahead of you Sir.
0,104,90,TEAL'C,Leave with us. Leave with us if you wish to live.
0,104,92,O'NEILL,Let's go.
0,104,93,BRA'TAC,Our time will come old friend. But not this day.
