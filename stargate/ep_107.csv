0,107,0,"""MERIDIAN""",By Robert C. Cooper
0,107,1,CARTER,We have to get to the infirmary. Daniel's been exposed to radiation.
0,107,2,HAMMOND,Have a medical team meet us on the way.
0,107,2,DAVIS,Medical team to Alpha 2. Repeat medical team to alpha 2.
0,107,3,HAMMOND,"Colonel, what happened?"
0,107,3,O'NEILL,"Detail's a little sketchy, sir."
0,107,3,TEAL'C,We were not present at the time of the incident.
0,107,4,DANIEL,Don't touch me!
0,107,4,CARTER,He may still be radioactive.
0,107,5,FRAISER,Let's get him scrubbed down.
0,107,6,FRAISER,Do we know what kind and how much?
0,107,6,CARTER,It was a device. Housing an unstable radioactive variation of Naqahdah. We think his right hand was exposed to the equivalent of over 8-9 grays of neutron radiation resulting from direct contact. Full body exposure of over seven.
0,107,6,FRAISER,Oh my god.
0,107,6,HAMMOND,Doctor?
0,107,6,CARTER,"It's a lethal dose, sir."
0,107,7,HAMMOND,"As you were. Dr Fraiser tells me there's nothing more we can do for Dr Jackson at the moment. In the meantime, tell me what happened."
0,107,8,CARTER,"Well sir, as you know from our initial reports, Colona is one of three major countries on 4C3. What we'd learned since our initial contact is that they seem to be at a similar stage of development to that of the United States in the 1940's. Geo-politically there is obvious mounting tension between the nations."
0,107,8,O'NEILL,"Sort of like a cold war, sir."
0,107,8,CARTER,The Colonans discovered their Stargate approximately 15 years ago. Unearthing it along with a number of Goa'uld artefacts in what appears to be an ancient temple.
0,107,8,TEAL'C,Their knowledge of the Gate is still limited.
0,107,8,CARTER,"But their interest is strong. When we told them what we could offer, they were eager to share any technologies they were developing that could potentially be offered in exchange."
0,107,9,JONAS,This is incredible. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Jonas Quinn; I'm special advisor to our High Minister.
0,107,9,O'NEILL,"Security's a little tight around here, I noticed."
0,107,9,JONAS,"As you have undoubtedly been told, this is one of our most secret and important research operations."
0,107,10,DANIEL,Daniel Jackson.
0,107,11,O'NEILL,"Colonel Jack O'Neill. Major Sam Carter and the tall, silent one is Teal'c."
0,107,11,JONAS,"Teal'c. Well, your arrival on our planet is an extraordinary event. It's my honour to show you around this facility. Please, follow me."
0,107,11,CARTER,He's an advisor to the High Minister.
0,107,11,O'NEILL,Their equivalent to our President.
0,107,11,CARTER,"As we understand it, Jonas was responsible for overseeing the research from an ethical perspective."
0,107,11,O'NEILL,"Yeah, whatever."
0,107,11,CARTER,"He had several degrees from their most honoured education institution. Social Studies, Ancient Colonan history..."
0,107,11,O'NEILL,"He was a nerd, sir. He and Daniel got along great."
0,107,11,DANIEL,"If we could have access to the site where the Gate was discovered and see the artefacts, we have this process called carbon dating. I could determine the age of the temple, maybe even find out how it was destroyed."
0,107,11,JONAS,I'm sure that can be arranged. Our archaeologists believe they have only begun to uncover the full extent of what may be buried. There were extensive alien writings.
0,107,11,DANIEL,Teal'c and I could help with the translation.
0,107,11,O'NEILL,Daniel?
0,107,11,JONAS,"I understand from our leaders that your knowledge and expertise will come at a price, Colonel? That is why you're here, right?"
0,107,11,O'NEILL,"Well don't get me wrong, we want to help out as much we can, it's just that we've been burned a little bit in the past."
0,107,11,DANIEL,We're not questioning so much what you have to offer in return.
0,107,11,CARTER,We just want to get to know you better first.
0,107,11,O'NEILL,That's it.
0,107,11,JONAS,"Still, hopefully we'll have much of value to offer in exchange. This way."
0,107,12,JONAS,We can go in now.
0,107,13,JONAS,"This is Tomis Lee. He is chief physicist overseeing the development of our most critical project. Tomis, this is SG-1, the planet Earth."
0,107,13,TOMIS,My pleasure.
0,107,13,CARTER,What is this?
0,107,13,TOMIS,The core of this device was uncovered in an ancient temple of a race of people we believe were called the Guld.
0,107,13,TEAL'C,Goa'uld.
0,107,13,JONAS,Really?
0,107,13,TOMIS,It's a mineral substance found to have highly unstable radioactive properties. This experiment seems to indicate the potential for great bursts of energy.
0,107,13,JONAS,Our translation of the writings in the temple indicate the alien element is called Naquadria.
0,107,13,DANIEL,Naqahdah.
0,107,13,JONAS,"No, we also translated that word in the same text. This is definitely Naquadria."
0,107,13,CARTER,So this is some sort of power generating device?
0,107,13,JONAS,Not exactly.
0,107,13,O'NEILL,They were making a bomb sir.
0,107,13,CARTER,They were far from achieving a deliverable weapon but if successful it would have been as powerful as a Naqahdah enhanced nuclear warhead.
0,107,13,TEAL'C,The Colonans claim they were under the threat of oppression from their neighbouring nations and the weapon would only be used to ensure their freedom.
0,107,13,HAMMOND,Sounds like a situation we would have to be very careful about getting involved in.
0,107,13,CARTER,Yes sir.
0,107,13,O'NEILL,"I'm not sure we need to worry about that, General."
0,107,13,HAMMOND,How so?
0,107,13,O'NEILL,I don't think they want our help any longer.
0,107,13,HAMMOND,Something to do with how Dr Jackson was exposed to that much radiation?
0,107,13,CARTER,We were touring the city. Daniel was at the research facility with Jonas. As I'm sure you can imagine he was pretty passionate about trying to convince the Colonan people that building a big bomb wasn't going to be the answer to their problems.
0,107,13,O'NEILL,"Still, we don't know..."
0,107,13,HAMMOND,"Colonel, what do you know?"
0,107,14,CARTER,"Sir, they're claiming Daniel sabotaged their research."
0,107,14,O'NEILL,"They're lying, General."
0,107,14,TEAL'C,I also do not believe this to be true.
0,107,14,CARTER,They let us bring him back home on compassionate grounds.
0,107,14,O'NEILL,"The fact is, they just didn't want us around there anymore."
0,107,14,CARTER,But they are demanding that he be returned to face the charges if he survives.
0,107,14,HAMMOND,What does Dr Jackson say happened?
0,107,15,DANIEL,"Nausea will be followed be tremors, convulsions and something called attaxia. Surface tissue, brain tissue and internal organs will inflame and degrade, I believe that's called necrosis. Now based on the dose of radiation I got, all that will happen in the next 10-15 hours and if I don't drown in my own fluids first, I will bleed to death and there is no medical treatment to prevent that."
0,107,15,O'NEILL,Maybe not that we know of.
0,107,15,DANIEL,"Jack, we don't go running to our offworld allies every time an individual's life's at stake. No good telling me that this is any different because my life is no more valuable than anybody elses."
0,107,15,O'NEILL,What happened?
0,107,15,DANIEL,That doesn't matter.
0,107,15,O'NEILL,Yes it does. You didn't try to sabotage anything.
0,107,15,DANIEL,There was an accident. I guess the scientists figured the Government would hold them responsible. I guess they figured it was easier to blame me.
0,107,15,O'NEILL,And you're okay with this?
0,107,15,DANIEL,No. But there's not much I can do about that.
0,107,15,O'NEILL,"Yes, there is."
0,107,15,DANIEL,"If they really want to blame me, denying it isn't going to change anything. Ten thousand years ago, a Goa'uld tried the same experiments that they're trying and he nearly blew the entire planet to bits. I tried telling them that, they wouldn't listen. They're gonna build that bomb and nothing we say is gonna stop them."
0,107,16,HAMMOND,"The Asgard are still not responding, Jack. We've tried to reach Jacob Carter but last we heard he's on a mission to recover the last remaining undercover Tok'ra."
0,107,16,O'NEILL,"General, we do have intelligence on a sarcophagus."
0,107,16,HAMMOND,SG3's mission report 2 months ago.
0,107,16,O'NEILL,Yes sir.
0,107,16,HAMMOND,We both know the negative effects of that technology Colonel.
0,107,16,O'NEILL,But Daniel's been in one of those things a dozen times. Once more won't hurt.
0,107,16,HAMMOND,However SG-3's report clearly indicated the sarcophagus is heavily guarded and likely retrieving it would result in significant casualties which is why I did not order a recovery mission at the time.
0,107,16,O'NEILL,Sir..
0,107,16,HAMMOND,"Colonel, please don't think you're alone in your feelings on this matter."
0,107,16,O'NEILL,Yes sir.
0,107,17,O'NEILL,Got anything?
0,107,17,CARTER,Well I've been doing some calculations.
0,107,17,O'NEILL,Anything to help Daniel?
0,107,17,CARTER,"I wish. Based on the amount of radiation the Colonans say Daniel was exposed to, I've estimated the amount of energy that would have been generated by the experiment."
0,107,17,O'NEILL,And?
0,107,17,CARTER,"The potential's astronomical, sir. Even a very small amount of the unstable element they're working with emitted a pulse of energy far greater than anything I've ever believed possible. Much more than weapons grade Naqahdah would have. It would require a massive nuclear reaction to even approach this level."
0,107,17,O'NEILL,So?
0,107,17,CARTER,"Sir, this could be the missing link we've been looking for in terms of generating the kind of energy I believe is necessary to create a hyperspace window. Or to generate and sustain the kind of shields the Goa'uld have been using to protect their ships. Sir, we have to get some of this element."
0,107,18,HAMMOND,By now their Government believes Dr Jackson was trying to sabotage their research.
0,107,18,O'NEILL,It's a lie. They're using Daniel as a scapegoat.
0,107,18,HAMMOND,Still you said he was vocal in his disapproval of their project before the accident. None of this bodes well for diplomatic relations.
0,107,18,O'NEILL,Why are you talking about diplomatic relations? This is Daniel's life.
0,107,18,CARTER,"Sir, I know how you feel because I feel the same way but I cannot stress enough how valuable this element could be."
0,107,18,HAMMOND,I will draft a letter to the Colonan leader..
0,107,18,O'NEILL,"General, you cannot capitulate to these people. They are lying bastards."
0,107,18,HAMMOND,Their Government doesn't know the truth.
0,107,18,O'NEILL,So we tell them.
0,107,18,HAMMOND,They will have little reason to believe us over their own people especially when what we're forcing them to admit would be a major embarrassment. It would put them at too great a disadvantage in further negotiations.
0,107,18,O'NEILL,"Sir, you cannot admit Daniel is guilty."
0,107,18,HAMMOND,Give me some credit Jack. I will tell them that we did not order any such action and do not condone its obvious intentions. Both of which are true. Hopefully we can lay the groundwork for further diplomatic negotiations which will eventually result in an amicable trade for the Naquadria. I'm ordering you to deliver the letter.
0,107,18,O'NEILL,"Fine, sir."
0,107,19,O'NEILL,Hey.
0,107,19,JONAS,Colonel O'Neill. I'm surprised to see you.
0,107,19,O'NEILL,I brought a letter from my superior to your leaders.
0,107,19,JONAS,Ah. That's an apology?
0,107,19,O'NEILL,"Yeah, hardly. You see, we know you're lying through your teeth."
0,107,19,JONAS,How is Dr Jackson?
0,107,19,O'NEILL,Not good.
0,107,19,JONAS,I'm sorry to hear that. Two of the other scientists in the room are dead; the other two will be shortly. Their deaths were horrific.
0,107,19,O'NEILL,My superior thinks that denying the allegations against Daniel would be a waste of time.
0,107,19,JONAS,He's a wise man. What I don't understand is why your Government is even trying to maintain a relationship with us?
0,107,19,O'NEILL,Because we want some of that stuff you're experimenting with. My Government still thinks they can negotiate for it.
0,107,19,JONAS,The Naquadria is very spare and extremely valuable to us. I doubt that my Government would ever agree to that.
0,107,19,O'NEILL,"Yeah, I figured. That's why I'm here."
0,107,19,JONAS,I don't understand.
0,107,19,O'NEILL,I only agreed to bring that letter so I could see you.
0,107,19,JONAS,Why?
0,107,19,O'NEILL,Because Daniel is dying.
0,107,19,JONAS,And you're looking for someone to blame?
0,107,19,O'NEILL,"I'm not gonna let you tarnish his name. See, I don't care what that stuff is worth to anyone. My Government will admit Daniel is guilty over my dead body."
0,107,19,JONAS,What do you want from me?
0,107,19,O'NEILL,Just tell the truth.
0,107,19,JONAS,"I can't. Even if I wanted to, without the support of the other scientists.."
0,107,19,O'NEILL,"Look, we're only in this mess because you and your buddies are lying cowards trying to cover your own incompetence."
0,107,19,JONAS,"Colonel, we desperately need the weapon we're developing. Without it, the Colonan people could easily fall to our rival nations who are developing their own powerful weapons as we speak. Now we're willing to do whatever's necessary to ensure our freedom and a lasting peace on this planet."
0,107,19,O'NEILL,"All right, let me be clear about something. I think this is the point Daniel was trying to make. A weapon of mass destruction can only be used for one thing. Now you might think it will ensure peace and freedom but I guarantee you it'll never have the effect you're hoping for until you use it at least once. Now just for the record, the reason we want that stuff is because we think it could be used to create defence shields. But you just go ahead, blow yourself to hell with it."
0,107,21,CARTER,He looks awful.
0,107,21,FRAISER,It's gonna get a lot worse and it's gonna happen fast.
0,107,21,CARTER,You sure you're doing everything you can?
0,107,21,FRAISER,"Sedatives and painkillers. That's all we can really do. You have no idea how painful this is gonna get. You know, I would never normally say this, it goes against everything I've been trained to do but the truth is he'd be a lot better off if I...."
0,107,23,CARTER,"Daniel. I didn't suggest this before because the truth is, I'm not really sure what I'm doing with this thing. I could make things worse."
0,107,25,FRAISER,He's seizing. Get the crash cart; give me 5 of Valium.
0,107,25,CARTER,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
0,107,26,FRAISER,"Help me get him on his side. Valium's in. Set up an ambubag; draw 2 grams of magnesium sulphate. Put him back, easy."
0,107,27,OMA,Your fate is in your hands.
0,107,28,DANIEL,Hey Jack.
0,107,28,O'NEILL,"Hey. I uh, I just wanted to.. I'm really bad at this."
0,107,28,DANIEL,Yes you are. I hear that Sam thinks the Naquadria might be an important discovery.
0,107,28,O'NEILL,"Yeah, apparently. If we can get some. For what it's worth, I tried to get your point across to Jonas."
0,107,28,DANIEL,He's in a tough position.
0,107,28,O'NEILL,You're not gonna take the fall for this. I don't care what's at stake.
0,107,28,DANIEL,Why do you care?
0,107,28,O'NEILL,"Because despite the fact that you've been a terrific pain in the ass for the last five years, I may have, might have, grown to admire you a little, I think."
0,107,28,DANIEL,That's touching.
0,107,28,O'NEILL,This will not be your last act on official record.
0,107,28,DANIEL,Oma.
0,107,28,O'NEILL,What?
0,107,29,DANIEL,"Oma Desala. I felt like I knew you, that we'd met before but you look different."
0,107,29,OMA,"Lightning flashes, sparks shower, in one blink of your eye you have mis-seen."
0,107,29,DANIEL,Right. What did you mean when you said my fate is in my hands?
0,107,29,OMA,When the mind is enlightened the spirit is freed and body matters not.
0,107,29,DANIEL,"You're talking about ascension, right? Rising to a different plane of existence. Are you saying that I could do that? Become like you?"
0,107,29,OMA,You must complete the journey you began at Kheb. Only then will you be able to find your way to the Great Path.
0,107,29,DANIEL,What do I do?
0,107,29,OMA,Release your burden.
0,107,29,DANIEL,"Okay, well consider it released. What's step 2?"
0,107,29,OMA,A tall man cannot hide in the short grass.
0,107,29,DANIEL,"You know, I really, I don't have time for one of these kind of conversations."
0,107,29,OMA,One cannot reach enlightenment by running from death.
0,107,29,DANIEL,Tell me what to do.
0,107,29,OMA,Many roads lead to the Great Path. Only the willing will find their way.
0,107,29,DANIEL,"Okay, well I'm willing. So let's go. I mean, you know, do your thing. Glow me."
0,107,29,OMA,The river tells no lies. Though standing on the shore the dishonest man still hears them.
0,107,29,DANIEL,Right. I didn't think it was gonna be that easy.
0,107,30,O'NEILL,What are you doing here?
0,107,30,JONAS,Your commander was kind enough to grant me passage. I brought this. Naquadria. Took as much as I could.
0,107,30,O'NEILL,Why?
0,107,30,JONAS,"The data recorded during that accident demonstrated the potential power of the weapon unlike anything collected previously. I really don't know what was worse, seeing my colleagues die in the manner they did, or seeing the looks of utter glee on our leaders faces when they were told the potential power of this weapon. They wanted to know when it could be demonstrated. I told them the truth about what happened."
0,107,31,JONAS,I read that book you gave me.
0,107,31,DANIEL,Already? I just gave it to you last night.
0,107,31,JONAS,Quick study. It's how I got this position at my age.
0,107,31,DANIEL,And?
0,107,31,JONAS,It should prove useful in the translations.
0,107,31,DANIEL,I thought you'd be a little more excited.
0,107,31,JONAS,No offence. I'm just more interested in what's out there. Through the Stargate.
0,107,31,DANIEL,"Well all I can say is whatever problems there are between your planet's nations, they will seem insignificant when you do find out what's going on out there."
0,107,31,JONAS,"Till you give us more details, there's not much else I can do."
0,107,31,DANIEL,"Well whether you realise it or not, you've probably seen the evidence right here on your own planet. The temple where you found the Gate was obviously occupied by a powerful technologically advanced race. Now as far as I can tell from the pictures you've shown me, their civilisation was destroyed by a catastrophic explosion."
0,107,31,JONAS,Our scientists have theorised that an asteroid impacted our continent ten thousand years ago. Now the fallout from that could have easily buried the civilisation at that time.
0,107,31,DANIEL,Or the race that occupied the Gate were experimenting with the very technology you are and it resulted in disaster.
0,107,31,JONAS,If what you say is true about the potential enemies out there in our galaxy we may need these advanced weapons more than ever.
0,107,31,DANIEL,I can't deny that but some very wise people have shown me first hand how a sudden leap in weapons technology by a civilisation that's not ready for it can lead to it's destruction.
0,107,32,JONAS,"Given the chance, you would deny us this technology?"
0,107,32,DANIEL,"I can't predict what would happen to your people or your planet with or without the weapon, I just wish there was another way."
0,107,33,SCIENTIST,The energy readings are increasing by a power of ten.
0,107,33,TOMIS,Incredible.
0,107,34,SCIENTIST,Did you see that?
0,107,35,TOMIS,Get down! Stay away from the glass. The radiation will penetrate the window.
0,107,35,JONAS,What's happening?
0,107,35,TOMIS,This device could explode.
0,107,35,SCIENTIST,We have to remove the core.
0,107,36,JONAS,Tomis!
0,107,37,JONAS,Dr Jackson!
0,107,38,JONAS,No! Dr Jackson!
0,107,39,JONAS,I am ashamed that they would not bring themselves to recognise Dr Jackson's heroism. He saved millions of lives.
0,107,40,DANIEL,Millions could still die.
0,107,40,OMA,The future's never certain. You saved many without regard for your own life.
0,107,40,DANIEL,Could have destroyed the device.
0,107,40,OMA,You believe your journey is not over?
0,107,40,DANIEL,"Actually I'm not entirely sure what the point of my journey so far has been, I mean if this is about being honest with yourself. I believe my entire life has been a failure."
0,107,41,CARTER,"Just so you know, Jonas had a change of heart."
0,107,42,CARTER,"He stole some Naquadria for us. He took a big risk, he said it was because of what you did. I think it could be important and I wanted you to know that. You have an effect on people, Daniel. The way you look at things, it changed me too. I see what really matters. I don't know why we wait to tell people how we really feel. I guess I hoped that you always knew."
0,107,43,OMA,You can never reach enlightenment if you do not believe you are worthy.
0,107,43,DANIEL,Then I guess we may have a problem.
0,107,44,TEAL'C,You once gave me this. You said that its spirit would one day serve it's owner in the afterlife.
0,107,45,DANIEL,"Thanks. I'm not dead yet, but... I guess it doesn't look so good right now."
0,107,45,TEAL'C,"If you are to die Daniel Jackson, I wish you to know that I believe that the fight against the Goa'uld will have lost one of it's greatest warriors."
0,107,46,TEAL'C,And I will have lost one of my greatest friends.
0,107,47,OMA,"Because it is so clear it takes a long time to realise it. If you immediately know the candlelight is fire, the meal was cooked a long time ago."
0,107,47,DANIEL,"Yeah, yeah, a monk at Kheb said that to me, I didn't know what it meant then and I still don't know now."
0,107,47,OMA,Why do you feel you have failed on your journey? You opened the Stargate for your world.
0,107,47,DANIEL,"I cracked the code, a lot of other people made it work."
0,107,47,OMA,The very next thing you did was help free the people of Abydos from evil.
0,107,48,DANIEL,"I had the chance to live out my life with her. I couldn't leave it alone. I was the one that unburied the Gate. What happened to her was my fault. I couldn't save Sha're, I couldn't save Sarah. Every Goa'uld I helped eliminate, another one took it's place. Maybe I did something good every now and again but nothing I've ever done seems to have changed anything."
0,107,48,OMA,These tasks of which you speak were great challenges. Perhaps they were even impossible to achieve.
0,107,48,DANIEL,Does that absolve me?
0,107,48,OMA,You feel your journey must continue until you have found redemption for these failures?
0,107,48,DANIEL,"No. No more of, I'm dead."
0,107,48,OMA,Exactly true.
0,107,48,DANIEL,"You said I was the only one qualified to judge myself? So how ever much I want to achievement enlightenment or whatever you want to call it, what happens if I look at my life and I don't honestly believe I deserve it?"
0,107,48,OMA,The success or failure of your deeds does not add up to the sum of your life. Your spirit cannot be weighed. Judge yourself by the intention of your actions and by the strength of which you faced the challenges that have stood in your way.
0,107,48,DANIEL,What if I can't?
0,107,48,OMA,"The people closest to you have been trying to tell you, you have made a difference. That you did change things for the better."
0,107,48,DANIEL,Not enough.
0,107,48,OMA,The universe is vast and we are so small. There is only one thing we can truly control.
0,107,48,DANIEL,What's that?
0,107,48,OMA,Whether we are good or evil.
0,107,48,JONAS,Obviously they do not know I am here. I was lucky enough to be able to access our Stargate. If I am caught returning to my planet I will be considered a traitor.
0,107,48,O'NEILL,What do you want?
0,107,48,JONAS,"I do not believe my people will ever truly support a war that leads to any kind of mass destruction. Our leaders just don't see any viable alternative right now. Promise me, if you're able to develop defence technologies such as these shields that you spoke of, you'll share them with my Government."
0,107,48,HAMMOND,Of course.
0,107,49,DAVIS,Unauthorised incoming wormhole.
0,107,49,HAMMOND,Wait here.
0,107,50,DAVIS,Receiving Tok'ra IDC sir.
0,107,50,HAMMOND,All defence teams on high alert.
0,107,50,DAVIS,High alert. Repeat high alert.
0,107,51,HAMMOND,Open the iris.
0,107,53,HAMMOND,Stand down.
0,107,54,HAMMOND,Sorry about that Jacob. Given what's happening with the Tok'ra lately we had to be sure it was you.
0,107,54,JACOB,Understood. What's going on?
0,107,54,O'NEILL,It's Daniel.
0,107,55,JACOB,Hey Sam. I'm so sorry.
0,107,56,CARTER,"I tried this, it didn't work."
0,107,56,JACOB,We'll do our best.
0,107,57,SELMAK,"His condition is grave. I do not know if I can save him. Even if I can, I do not believe I can restore his full healthy state."
0,107,57,CARTER,Do what you can.
0,107,59,DANIEL,You're leaving. You can't leave.
0,107,59,OMA,The rest is up to you.
0,107,59,DANIEL,"Why, why me? Why, why give me this chance?"
0,107,59,OMA,Anyone can reach enlightenment. Anyone prepared to open their mind as you did when you first came to Kheb.
0,107,59,DANIEL,"They're trying to save me. They're healing me, I can feel it."
0,107,59,OMA,Then your journey will continue as before.
0,107,59,DANIEL,What if I don't want it to? Not that way.
0,107,59,OMA,Walking the Great Path brings great responsibility. You cannot fear it nor hesitate in your resolve.
0,107,59,DANIEL,I understand. I'm ready to go with you.
0,107,59,OMA,Then stop them.
0,107,59,DANIEL,How?
0,107,60,O'NEILL,Daniel?
0,107,60,DANIEL,Yeah.
0,107,60,O'NEILL,Did you want something?
0,107,60,DANIEL,Yeah. Tell Jacob to stop.
0,107,60,O'NEILL,Why?
0,107,60,DANIEL,Because I'm ready to move on.
0,107,60,O'NEILL,You just giving up?
0,107,60,DANIEL,"No. No, I'm not giving up, believe me."
0,107,61,DANIEL,You remember Oma?
0,107,61,O'NEILL,Sure.
0,107,61,DANIEL,I think I can do more this way. It's what I want. I have to go now. Everything's gonna be fine. Please Jack. Tell Jacob to stop.
0,107,62,O'NEILL,Jacob. Stop.
0,107,62,JACOB,Are you serious?
0,107,62,O'NEILL,It's what he wants.
0,107,63,JACOB,Someone else want to tell me what to do?
0,107,63,O'NEILL,Just let him go.
0,107,64,FRAISER,Colonel!
0,107,65,DANIEL,I'm gonna miss you guys.
0,107,65,O'NEILL,"Yeah, you too."
0,107,65,DANIEL,Thank you. For everything.
0,107,65,O'NEILL,"So, what? See you around?"
0,107,65,DANIEL,I don't know.
0,107,66,O'NEILL,Hey. Where are you going?
0,107,66,DANIEL,I don't know.
