0,110,0,"""REDEMPTION II""",By Robert C. Cooper A shot of the X-302 is shown being wheeled on a runway.
0,110,0,SAM VOICEOVER,The X-302 will be the first human built spacecraft ... Capable of intersteller travel.
0,110,0,GENERAL HAMMOND,Colonel Chekov feels a Russian officer should be assigned to join SG-1.
0,110,0,JACK,"Over my rotting corpse, Sir."
0,110,0,JONAS,I want to join you.
0,110,0,SAM,I just don't see it happening. We detected an energy buildup within the gate.
0,110,0,JAFFA,The Tauri are in danger ... they are under attack from Anubis.
0,110,0,SAM,"We're talking about a blast 2,000 to 3,000 megatons."
0,110,0,JACK,There's worse??
0,110,0,SAM,We have no idea how to stop it.
0,110,0,HAMMOND,"If the X-302 fails, this planet will be destroyed."
0,110,0,SAM,"Even if we do manage to contact the Asguard, there's a chance they won't be able to help us."
0,110,0,BRATAC,"Anubis has grown powerful; but still, only defends a very small handful of planets. If one of those stargates also can not be contacted ..."
0,110,0,TEAL'C,"... It is most likely, the origin of the attack."
0,110,1,JACK,"Mission command, we missed the window."
0,110,1,SAM,"We thought we'd compensated for the energy fluctuations emitted by the Naquadria, but apparently not."
0,110,1,HAMMOND,"Bottom line is, we're on our own."
0,110,1,JACK,") Oh, PLEASE!"
0,110,1,MCKAY,"He has a real FLAIR for the dramatic, doesn't he?? Very theatrical."
0,110,1,SAM,Yeah. Pretty much all the Goa'Uld are like that.
0,110,1,MCKAY,"But, why wait? Why does this guy show up a day and a half after this all starts to do his whole ""Prepare to meet your doom"" thing?"
0,110,1,SAM,I don't know. Maybe he wanted to make sure it was gonna work.
0,110,1,MCKAY,"Yeah, that WOULD be embarrassing, wouldn't it? --- ""Nothing can stop the destruction That I bring upon you!"" Then the gate shuts down. Oops, sorry. Nevermind ..."
0,110,1,SAM,"Yeah, well, that didn't happen, and we only have ... 54 hours left."
0,110,1,GEEK # 1,"Major, can I see you for a second? When the gate was connected to the black hole, a shaped charge was used to disengage the wormhole."
0,110,1,GEEK #2,"Yes, but that was an outgoing wormhole."
0,110,1,GEEK # 1,"True, but ..."
0,110,1,GEEK # 2,The blast would detonate the gate.
0,110,1,MCKAY,Wait a minute ...
0,110,1,GEEK # 1,If you'd just let me FINISH!
0,110,1,MCKAY,"No, you're both horribly wrong, both of you, but you gave me an idea. We know that certain waves can travel in both directions thru a wormhole ... radio signals for one."
0,110,1,SAM,"So, what? We call Anubis up, ask him to stop?"
0,110,1,MCKAY,"Yeah, ""Hey, Anubis, this is you agent, you're playing it way over the top, can you get serious, please??"""
0,110,1,SAM,You were saying ... ?
0,110,1,MCKAY,"We send a massive EM pulse back thru the wormhole, knock out whatever it is that's making this happen on the other end."
0,110,1,HAMMOND,Will that work?
0,110,1,SAM,"No, Sir. I already thought of it, and the reason I didn't mention it, is because it would be too problematic."
0,110,1,MCKAY,More so than the gate exploding?
0,110,1,SAM,The Iris would have to be opened.
0,110,1,MCKAY,"Well, the gateroom's shielded, isn't it?"
0,110,1,HAMMOND,"Major, are you saying that this absolutely won't work?"
0,110,1,SAM,What I'm saying is that we have no idea how much EM would be required to knock this thing out.
0,110,1,MCKAY,"So, let's all just go home."
0,110,1,HAMMOND,How long will it take to set up?
0,110,1,MCKAY,"Four hours ,tops."
0,110,1,HAMMOND,That's how long you have to come up with a better idea.
0,110,1,BRATAC,I have tried to connect to this world twice now. It is the only one I can not make contact with.
0,110,1,TEAL'C,Than we must hope that is the location of the weapon.
0,110,1,RY'AC,"I'm coming with you. If the Goa'Uld truly can be defeated, than I wish to be a part of it. You said I could not judge this war if I am yet to fight a battle. You've trained me. Now let me fight. You said you did not doubt me."
0,110,1,TEAL'C,I do not.
0,110,1,RYAC,Than I will join you.
0,110,1,BRA'TAC,Be quick!
0,110,1,TEAL'C,Very well.
0,110,1,SAM,"Sirs, I've calculated that opening the iris will increase the flow of energy to the gate by at least 10 times. Nw, if this doesn't work, we'll be cutting as much as half the remaining time before the gate detonates."
0,110,1,JACK,No ... better idea yet?
0,110,1,SAM,No.
0,110,1,HAMMOND,"Major, I know you and Dr. McKay don't see eye to eye, ..."
0,110,1,SAM,"Sir, this has nothing to do wi ..."
0,110,1,HAMMOND,"I believe if this plan has any chance of working, it's with your cooperation."
0,110,1,SAM,"Yes, Sir."
0,110,2,RY'AC,I know what I'm doing.
0,110,2,JAFFA,We are approaching the planet.
0,110,2,BRA'TAC,It is heavily guarded.
0,110,2,TEAL'C,That is a good sign that we have the correct location of the weapon.
0,110,2,JAFFA,) There are rings on the surface.
0,110,2,BRA'TAC,We must hope to catch any Jaffa on the ground by surprise.
0,110,2,MCKAY,Right here. You just want to be able to take credit for it when it works.
0,110,2,SAM,") For the record, I *HATE* you."
0,110,2,MCKAY,"Well, can't get any worse, then,can it?"
0,110,2,SAM,"Oh, no. I'm rapidly working up to ""Despise""."
0,110,2,MCKAY,"You know, we're obviously gonna have to get over this physical attraction thing if we're going to work together."
0,110,2,SAM,I think I can act as though it never existed.
0,110,2,MCKAY,Shall we save the world?
0,110,2,SAM,Before I take the credit for this ... shouldn't the EM pulse generator be pointed *AT* the gate??
0,110,2,MCKAY,You good! VERY good!
0,110,2,TEAL'C,"Ryac ... You are to remain on board with Shaq'Rel. (Well, there's his name!"
0,110,2,RY'AC,Why?!?!
0,110,2,TEAL'C,"One day, you will be a great warrior. This day, the danger is just too great."
0,110,2,RY'AC,I am prepared to die.
0,110,2,TEAL'C,I am not prepared to let you die.
0,110,3,SHAQ'REL,Two gliders in pursuit.
0,110,3,TEAL'C,How is that possible?? Are we not cloaked?!
0,110,3,BRA'TAC,Anubis must now have means of detecting cloaked ships.
0,110,3,SHAQ'REL,"I am de cloaking, and diverting power to shields. Entering range of service rings."
0,110,3,BRA'TAC,Teal'C ...
0,110,3,RY'AC,Is it not equally as dangerous on this ship as it will be on the planet??
0,110,3,SHAQ'REL,Go! I will do my best to return for you.
0,110,3,TEAL'C,Come. Stay close to me. The forces on the ground may have been alerted to our presence.
0,110,3,SHAQ'REL,Chel'Nok!
0,110,3,JAFFA,Identify yourselves!
0,110,4,BRA'TAC,We must MOVE!
0,110,4,MCKAY,That's it!
0,110,4,SAM,"We're ready , Sir."
0,110,4,HAMMOND,Close the blast doors. Open the iris.
0,110,4,SAM,Energy transfer is increasing. Seven times greater ... eight ... 10 ...
0,110,4,MCKAY,"Go! Yeah, Go!"
0,110,4,HAMMOND,Do it.
0,110,4,DAVIS,Activating electromagnetic pulse.
0,110,5,SAM,"Energy transfer is still increasing. Look, if this was going to work ..."
0,110,6,HAMMOND,Close the iris!
0,110,7,DAVIS,We're offline!
0,110,7,MCKAY,"She's not gonna be happy when she wakes up, is she??"
0,110,7,HAMMOND,Medical team to the control room!
0,110,7,MCKAY,"SHe IS gonna wake up, isn't she??"
0,110,7,BRA'TAC,The path is well traveled. We must stay undercover. Many gliders patrol the skies.
0,110,7,TEAL'C,This wound is not small. You must be in great pain.
0,110,7,RY'AC,Nothing I can not bear.
0,110,7,TEAL'C,You could easily be dead.
0,110,7,RY'AC,I do not understand. There was at least eight of them.
0,110,7,BRA'TAC,Ten.
0,110,7,RY'AC,How did either of you get hit??
0,110,7,TEAL'C,It is always more difficult to hit a moving target.
0,110,7,BRA'TAC,It is also helpful to be lucky.
0,110,8,TEAL'C,There is little time to waste.
0,110,10,MCKAY,Hi.
0,110,10,SAM,") Oh, Man! I was just starting to feel better!"
0,110,10,MCKAY,Are you gonna be OK?
0,110,10,SAM,"At least until the gate explodes, yeah."
0,110,10,MCKAY,"Look, I ne ... I never meant for anyone to get hurt ... much less you."
0,110,10,SAM,It's OK. We had to try something.
0,110,10,MCKAY,I always wanted to be a pianist.
0,110,10,SAM,Excuse me?
0,110,10,MCKAY,"A concert pianist --- you know, a guy who plays the piano in front of lots of people?"
0,110,10,SAM,) Right.
0,110,10,MCKAY,What did you think I said?
0,110,10,SAM,Never mind.
0,110,10,MCKAY,") I had a not-so- comfortable childhood. My Parents hated each other, blamed me. Music was my salvation. It had this ... perfect order for me."
0,110,10,SAM,"That's nice, really."
0,110,10,MCKAY,"When I was 12, my teacher told me to quit. A fine clinical player, he said, but no sense of the art whatsoever."
0,110,10,SAM,Why are you telling me this?
0,110,10,MCKAY,I'm just ... trying to bond.
0,110,10,SAM,Why?
0,110,10,MCKAY,"Hospital gowns turn me on. I turned to science because I thought it would be different than music, but It isn't. It's just the same, it's just as much of an art as anything else."
0,110,10,SAM,"Look, it's not your fault that the EM pulse didn't work."
0,110,10,MCKAY,"You're an artist, Major. Maybe the best I've ever seen. I'm just critical because I'm jealous."
0,110,10,SAM,"I'm touched, really. I wish I had a brilliant plan to draw up for you."
0,110,10,MCKAY,"And you're funny, too. Even electrocuted. I mean, I've ... I've got nothing."
0,110,10,SAM,"You're creeping me out, McKay."
0,110,10,MCKAY,"It's just self preservation, see? I'm realizing that I won't be able to solve this, and that one of your insane idea will be our best chance."
0,110,10,SAM,How much time until detonation?
0,110,10,MCKAY,"You were right, we cut it almost in half."
0,110,10,SAM,25 hours.
0,110,10,MCKAY,What now?
0,110,10,SAM,"Well, first, I thought I'd get dressed."
0,110,10,MCKAY,Right.
0,110,10,SAM,Leave.
0,110,10,MCKAY,"Right. Do you want me to ... hold anything, or ... ) Yeah."
0,110,12,BRA'TAC,This weapon is unlike any Goa'Uld design I have ever seen.
0,110,12,TEAL'C,I have seen similar a construction before. It appears to have been built by the Ancients ...
0,110,12,RY'AC,Who are they?
0,110,12,TEAL'C,"An advanced race of beings who, long ago, created the stargates."
0,110,12,RY'AC,But I thought the ...
0,110,12,TEAL'C,The Goa'Uld steal the technology and claim it as their own.
0,110,12,BRA'TAC,"If this is not Goa'Uld technology, then Anubis has nearly learned to operate it , then ..."
0,110,12,TEAL'C,"Perhaps by destroying it, he will not be able to rebuilt it quickly."
0,110,12,RY'AC,But do we have sufficient explosives?
0,110,12,TEAL'C,That does not concern you. You are to remain here.
0,110,12,RY'AC,"But, I ..."
0,110,12,TEAL'C,"You are injured. You will slow our pace, and risk giving us away."
0,110,12,RY'AC,But my symbiote heals me. I CAN go.
0,110,12,BRA'TAC,"Ry'Ac, listen to him. This is but one of many battles to be fought."
0,110,12,TEAL'C,Remain here until sundown. We will try to return before then.
0,110,12,GEEK # 1,"If we encase the gate in trinium alloy, it could reduce the effects of the explosion by as much as 40 %."
0,110,12,GEEK # 2,"There isn't time for that plan! If we detonate the gate ourselves right now, we could reduce the eventual damage by as much as 20%."
0,110,12,GEEK # 1,The damage to the planet's atmosphere would still be irreversible.
0,110,12,GEEK # 2,So far we've been unsuccessful in our ...
0,110,12,SAM,
0,110,12,MCKAY,Besides the fact that these guys are morons?? What do you think the little Alien guy's doing down there??
0,110,13,SAM,I bet you regret coming her now.
0,110,13,JONAS,"Can't really look at it that way, can we?"
0,110,13,SAM,So ... what are you doing?
0,110,13,JONAS,"You know, it's the stupidest thing, but it's been bugging me since I got here."
0,110,13,SAM,What's that?
0,110,13,JONAS,We're inside a mountain. The obviously can't fit thru any of these doors ...
0,110,13,SAM,"So, how did we get it in here?"
0,110,13,JONAS,Yeah!
0,110,13,SAM,"The ceiling retracts. Above it is a shaft that leads to the surface, and inside is a crane mechanism that hoisted the gate down."
0,110,13,JONAS,Interesting.
0,110,13,SAM,Yeah.
0,110,13,JONAS,Does it go up?
0,110,13,SAM,Moving the gate won't shut it off. I mean there is nowhere on Earth that ...
0,110,13,JONAS,I knew you'd think of something.
0,110,14,TEAL'C,This shield most likely extends around the perimeter of the weapon.
0,110,14,BRA'TAC,The Path ...
0,110,14,SAM,") Just hear me out, people. All we need to do is get it far enough away from Earth. (Hammond, McKay, and Jonas"
0,110,14,MCKAY,"See, now *THAT'S* crazy!"
0,110,14,GEEK # 2,We have less than 24 hours.
0,110,14,SAM,"2 hours to get the gate to the surface, 4 to get it to Peterson and loaded onto a C-17, and 2 more to fly it to Area 51. A 747 meets us in Nevada , which leaves us 16 hours to get the whole rig mounted and airborne ... and none of this is gonna happen if we're all just standing around here. Now, I think that this is gonna save the planet, and ... we ARE gonna do it."
0,110,14,HAMMOND,
0,110,14,SAM,"It wasn't all my idea, Sir, and I dare say it's not done yet."
0,110,14,HAMMOND,Right.
0,110,14,SAM,"Sir ... you do realize that if this works, we won't have a Stargate anymore"
0,110,14,HAMMOND,It *did* occur to me.
0,110,16,CYLER,
0,110,16,CHEKOV,") I have been instructed by my superiors to offer the following compromise: In exchange for your continued cooperation, and full disclosure of the X-302 technology, :16 :55:39 left on the clock, watching the gate being lifted out of the room) we are willing to facilitate the use of our stargate."
0,110,16,HAMMOND,Facilitate??
0,110,16,CHEKOV,A financial arrangement to be negotiated.
0,110,16,HAMMOND,You want us to *Rent* it?!
0,110,16,CHEKOV,A simplistic way of putting it.
0,110,16,HAMMOND,The X-302 's hyperspace technology doesn't even work.
0,110,16,CHEKOV,"It will someday. Obviously, the reason I am here is because my government is unwilling to incur the expense and risk in running a Stargate program such as this one. We are simply trying ..."
0,110,16,HAMMOND,"Here's the part you obviously don't understand ... even if ... and I stress ""IF"" we are able to successfully dispose of THIS gate, there's nothing stopping Anubis from starting all over again with the second gate. No one's going to be running a Stargate program, Colonel. The second gate *HAS* to stay buried!"
0,110,16,JAFFA,
0,110,16,TEAL'C,"He did not create the weapon, and he is NOT a god!"
0,110,16,JAFFA,"Your god may have been weak, Shol'Va! Mine is not!"
0,110,16,TEAL'C,"If you know of me, than you know of our cause. The Jaffa rebellion grows strong. All Goa'Uld are false gods, and their only REAL power comes from the Jaffa whom they oppress!"
0,110,16,JAFFA,"The next time that you open your mouth to speak, it will be to answer my questions. You did not kill all the Jaffa at the rings. We know there are three of you. Where's the boy? Evidence of how desperate your pathetic little rebellion is ... You bring a *BOY* to fight the war of *MEN*?"
0,110,16,JACK,Is there anything else I should know?
0,110,16,SAM,"Well, there is concern that the 302 may not have the fuel capacity to exit the atmosphere carrying the weight of the stargate."
0,110,16,JACK,How is *that* possible??
0,110,16,SAM,The engines were designed for a craft with a Alien Inertial dampening system the effectually reduced it's overall mass.
0,110,16,JACK,"Yes, and??"
0,110,16,SAM,"Well, you'll be carrying a very heavy load ."
0,110,16,JACK,How heavy?
0,110,16,SAM,"The gate ways 64,000 pounds, Sir."
0,110,16,JACK,That's heavy.
0,110,16,SAM,And you'll need to reach an altitude exceeding 180 kilometers ...
0,110,16,JACK,"... At minimum escape velocity before I release the gate, or it'll fall back to Earth ... I know, I know."
0,110,16,SAM,"Well, based on the X-302 's fuel burn capacity, even a full burn won't do it, which means the other engines will have to get you part ways up, hauling something that weighs 6 times greater than it was designed to carry."
0,110,16,JACK,"Yeah, Carter ..."
0,110,16,SAM,"Well, the whole rig isn't exactly aerodynamic either."
0,110,16,JACK,Carter ... I'm sure I want to know any of this.
0,110,16,SAM,"They're working on lightning the 302, but that's why you're going alone. Believe it or not, every pound counts."
0,110,16,JACK,I shouldn't have had that cake.
0,110,16,SAM,I wish I could go with you Sir.
0,110,16,JACK,"Yes, I'm sure you do. And I find that quite bizarre. Anything else?"
0,110,16,SAM,"Well, Sir, if this works, Jonas really deserves ..."
0,110,16,JACK,What? Deserves what?
0,110,16,SAM,"I don't know ... something. He's the one who gave me the idea to do this. Sir, he gave up everything to bring us the Naquadria."
0,110,16,JACK,The hyperspace generator doesn't work.
0,110,16,SAM,"That's not his fault. Good luck, Sir."
0,110,16,JACK,"Hey, what could go wrong, huh?"
0,110,20,JACK,What exactly did you remove?
0,110,20,MURPHY,"Weapons, some life support ... don't worry, there's still more than a day's worth."
0,110,20,JACK,"Well, if we need more than an hour, we're all in trouble."
0,110,20,MURPHY,"Right. We also took out RADAR, some of the crash safety mechanisms, landing gear ..."
0,110,20,JACK,Excuse me??
0,110,20,MURPHY,"We had to in order to properly accommodate the clamping system, so once you reenter the atmosphere, you're gonna have to eject. That is after you target to spash down off the coast of Florida."
0,110,20,JACK,Just ... when were you gonna tell me this part?
0,110,20,MURPHY,Just now. We weren't sure any of this was gonna happen until 5 minutes ago. You're not gonna believe this ...
0,110,20,JACK,Holy Crap!
0,110,21,MURPHY,They're waiting for you. Good luck!
0,110,22,SAM,"They're airborne, Sir."
0,110,22,PILOT,"Mission Command, we're approaching separation altitude."
0,110,23,PILOT,"Colonel, confirming altitude at 10,000 meters."
0,110,23,JACK,"Yeah, Roger that."
0,110,23,MISSION COMMAND,"This is mission command, you have a go for separation, Starflight."
0,110,23,JACK,Proceeding with separation. Separation complete.
0,110,23,MISSION COMMAND,"Good luck, Sir."
0,110,23,JACK,Stop saying that.
0,110,23,SAM,Altitude reaching 30 kilometers.
0,110,23,JACK,"Velocity at ... MACH 6 ... engaging erospike engines. Uh ... it's getting a little bumpy up here, Command"
0,110,23,MISSION COMMAND,"Roger that, Starflight. You're still too shallow to fire the rocket booster."
0,110,23,JACK,"Alright, I may have been understating things ... it feels like this thing's falling apart."
0,110,23,SAM,Altitude is 42 kilometers. He needs to reach 50 before he can fire the main rocket engine.
0,110,23,JACK,"Command, I've got a mater caution alarm."
0,110,23,MISSION COMMAND,"Roger that, Starflight."
0,110,23,JACK,I'm losing power.
0,110,23,MISSION COMMAND,"Starflight, your altitude only 48 kilometers ..."
0,110,23,JACK,"Full port engine failure , Starboard at 6-0 %. Preparing to ignite rocket booster."
0,110,23,MISSION COMMAND,"You're still too low, Starflight."
0,110,23,JACK,"I'm losing velocity, Command, I'm going to start losing altitude. Command, please advise."
0,110,25,SAM,"Velocity is 25,000 kilometers per hour ... 28 ... he's gotta reach 40, and sustain it for at least 15 seconds now"
0,110,25,JACK,"Main engine burn at 1-0-0 % Velocity approaching 40,000 kilometers per hour ... altitude at 1-2-0 kilometers."
0,110,25,SAM,"Five, six, seven ..."
0,110,25,JACK,"Preparing to release the gate, command."
0,110,25,MISSION COMMAND,"Not yet, Starflight!"
0,110,25,JACK,"I'm burning out here. Alright, that's it! I'm outta gas."
0,110,25,MISSION COMMAND,"Starflight, your altitude is 130 kilometers."
0,110,25,SAM,"He's not gonna make it. Velocity is slowing rapidly, he had to fire the rocket booster too early."
0,110,25,HAMMOND,It didn't work?
0,110,25,SAM,"He's going to fall back to Earth, Sir."
0,110,25,JACK,Ok ... got any idea??
0,110,26,JACK,Anyone want to wish me luck?
0,110,26,MISSION COMMAND,We're working on it.
0,110,26,SAM,"Based on altitude, angle of ascent, and current velocity, he's gonna hit the coast of Europe in 35 minutes."
0,110,26,MCKAY,"If he put the 302 in a nosedive, he could cut his descent time in half."
0,110,26,JONAS,Why would we do that?
0,110,26,MCKAY,"So he could drop the gate in the Atlantic. I'm thinking there's time for it to sink maybe 2 ... 3,000 feet."
0,110,26,HAMMOND,Will that do any good?
0,110,26,MCKAY,Enough to reduce the effects of the devastation.
0,110,26,HAMMOND,By how much?
0,110,26,SAM,"Not much, Sir."
0,110,26,MCKAY,"Enough that it's worth a shot, isn't it??"
0,110,26,BRA'TAC,Ry'Ac!
0,110,26,MISSION COMMAND,"We believe we can reduce the extent of the damage by dropping the gate into the ocean. You're going to have to put the 302 into a nosedive ..., and ..."
0,110,26,JACK,What?!
0,110,26,MISSION CONTROL,"Starflight, that's all we've got."
0,110,26,JACK,What about the hyperdrive?
0,110,26,MISSION CONTROL,"Colonel, it didn't work."
0,110,26,JACK,"We just don't know *Where* it'll send me, right? Who cares ... as long as it's a galaxy far, far away ..."
0,110,26,SAM,"He's right! The window formed, it was just unstable."
0,110,26,MURPHY,"Colonel, we don't know what would happen if we tried to open a hyperspace window within the atmosphere."
0,110,26,JACK,"Yeah, well, given the situation ..."
0,110,27,MURPHY,We're taking it under advisement.
0,110,27,HAMMOND,"Major, I can make a call."
0,110,27,SAM,"Do it, Sir."
0,110,27,MCKAY,"You really are a certifiable lunatic! I know what I said about you being an artist, but I hadn't slept in 3 days, I mean this is deranged! You're talking about putting an interdimential field around an already highly charged stargate with an unstable and a completely unpredictable burst of energy!"
0,110,27,SAM,I realize th ...
0,110,27,MCKAY,What I am suggesting has real tangible benefits.
0,110,27,SAM,"Maybe it saves a few lives. If this works, we save the entire planet!"
0,110,27,MCKAY,What chance do we have of that?!
0,110,27,JONAS,"Well, maybe we can reduce the risk a little."
0,110,27,SAM & MCKAY,How??
0,110,27,JONAS,"Well, the instability of the Naquadria is ..."
0,110,27,SAM,... Is relative to the size of the burst you're trying to extract.
0,110,27,MCKAY,"We don't actually have to send the gate across the galaxy, do we?"
0,110,27,SAM,Even a second in hyperspace potentially gets us million of miles!
0,110,27,MCKAY,Make the call!
0,110,27,HAMMOND,This is General Hammond. I need to speak with the President immediately!
0,110,27,JACK,Altitude ... 7-6 kilometers and still falling.
0,110,27,MURPHY,
0,110,27,JACK,Thank you. Run me thru it.
0,110,27,SAM,"Sir, we're gonna have to override the safety protocol that caused the X-302 to avoid the unstable wormhole. We think we can greatly increase the chance of this working by only activating the generator for one second. Unfortunately, it wasn't programmed to work for such a short period of time."
0,110,27,MCKAY,Hang on ...
0,110,27,SAM,Right. Of course. Thank you. We're gonna write a new subroutine. It'll be ready to upload in a few minutes.
0,110,27,JACK,"Alright, well, in the meantime, I'll just ... keep falling."
0,110,28,1,54 left on the clock.
0,110,28,JACK,Carter ...
0,110,28,SAM,"we're done! Uploading the new program, Sir. All you'll have to do now is activate the generator."
0,110,28,JACK,Roger that.
0,110,28,SAM,You won't have much time.
0,110,28,JACK,I know.
0,110,28,SAM,"Sir, if this works ..."
0,110,28,JACK,I know!
0,110,28,SAM,Sir ...
0,110,28,JACK,What??
0,110,28,SAM,Good luck.
0,110,28,JACK,Activating Hyperspace generator ... Now ...
0,110,28,MAN,This is observer one ... we have visual confirmation ... the X- 302 has entered the hyperspace window.
0,110,28,SAM,Colonel?? Colonel?? Do you read??
0,110,28,MAN,"This is observer one ... there is NO sign of a chute. There is, however, a light show going on up here"
0,110,28,DAVIS,It worked! Deeps space is estimating that the gate detonated over 3 million miles from earth.
0,110,28,SECOND MAN,"This is observer 2 ... I have a visual on a chute ... moving in for confirmation. Mission command, the cockpit is intact! We are pinpointing splashdown position."
0,110,28,DAVIS,Patching in satellite imagery.
0,110,28,MURPHY,"Observer 2, para rescue team is on the way."
0,110,28,OBSERVOR 2,"Roger that! Colonel O'Neill is conscious, and waving!"
0,110,28,TEAL'C,The gate has shut down.
0,110,28,BRA'TAC,Let us hope it is not too late.
0,110,28,TEAL'C,Look ...
0,110,29,TEAL'C,
0,110,31,MCKAY,So that's it?? You're just giving up?? Closing down shop?
0,110,31,SAM,"Well, at least until we find out a way to defend ourselves against this sort of thing, yeah."
0,110,31,MCKAY,It shouldn't take *you* long.
0,110,31,SAM,"Yeah, right. I thought you'd be happy."
0,110,31,MCKAY,"Hey, I never said we shouldn't use the stargate. Well, um ... Let me know if I could help."
0,110,31,SAM,"I will, thanks."
0,110,31,MCKAY,That means you don't hate me.
0,110,31,SAM,Maybe ... too bad for you.
0,110,31,MCKAY,Why?
0,110,31,SAM,I was more attracted to you when I did.
0,110,31,MCKAY,Really?? Right ...
0,110,31,HAMMOND,Colonel ... I'm glad you're OK.
0,110,31,JACK,Thank you. Sir.
0,110,31,HAMMOND,"You know, the President wants to see you in person?"
0,110,31,JACK,"Yes, we spoke on my way here."
0,110,31,HAMMOND,You can have any assignment you want.
0,110,31,JACK,"Actually, I've always wanted to command my own boat."
0,110,31,HAMMOND,For the Navy?
0,110,31,JACK,Or something a little smaller ... with oars.
0,110,31,HAMMOND,"You deserve it, Jack."
0,110,31,JACK,"You sure you want to take this with you, Sir?"
0,110,31,HAMMOND,"We're closed for business. I was supposed to retire five years ago. We don't know how long it's going to be before we can reestablish the Stargate Program, if ever."
0,110,31,JACK,"Actually, I just meant, it says 'Property of US Air Force ' on it."
0,110,31,HAMMOND,"Yeah, I still feel responsible for the teams stuck off-world. but there's nothing we can d --- Hammond. We're receiving a communication."
0,110,31,SAM,What's up?
0,110,31,DAVIS,Go ahead. They're all here.
0,110,31,TEAL'C,GeneralHammond ...
0,110,31,SAM & JACK,Teal'C! ...
0,110,31,TEAL'C,"O'Neill! It is good to hear you as well ... The weapon being used by Anubis has been destroyed, but we feared it was too late for the Tauri."
0,110,31,JACK,"Yeah, it was close there for a minute."
0,110,31,TEAL'C,We approach in a cargo ship ... request permission to land.
0,110,31,DAVIS,
0,110,31,HAMMOND,"Permission granted! Welcome back, Teal'C!"
0,110,31,JACK,Good job!
0,110,31,TEAL'C,"It is, in fact, Ry'Ac, who deserves the honour."
0,110,33,SAM,"Sir, if you don't mind me asking ... what exactly did we give the Russians?"
0,110,33,HAMMOND,"Good 'ole American Dollars, Major."
0,110,33,SAM,You're kidding!
0,110,33,HAMMOND,And the plans for the X-302 & X-303.
0,110,33,SAM,Really??
0,110,33,HAMMOND,(Rolls his eyes
0,110,33,JACK,So I hear you're a pretty good pilot.
0,110,33,RY'AC,Master Bratac taught me well. I hope to be good as my father one day.
0,110,33,JACK,Just know that no one is THAT good.
0,110,33,RY'AC,It also helps to be lucky.
0,110,33,JACK,"Don't I know that! Listen, are you sure you don't wanna stick around for a little while, maybe hang out?"
0,110,33,TEAL'C,Ry'Ac has chosen to help Bra'Tac spread the word of our cause.
0,110,33,JACK,"Well, it's good to see you again."
0,110,34,JONAS,Colonel! Colonel ... have you got a moment?
0,110,34,JACK,"Carter told me everything you did to help out. We all appreciate it, thanks alot. See you later."
0,110,34,JONAS,Colonel ... Dr. Jackson is gone.
0,110,34,JACK,"Yeah, I noticed that."
0,110,34,JONAS,"Not a day goes by when I don't think about what happened. I stood by and watched while he saved my people from disaster. It should have been me who jumped thru the glass, disarmed the device, and he's gone because I didn't. You have to live with that, so do I."
0,110,34,JACK,You want me to make you feel better? It wasn't your fault. I don't blame you.
0,110,34,JONAS,"If I could go back and change what happened, I would do that. But I can't. All I can do is try to change what happens from now on. I don't want you to exonerate me. I just want to be given the opportunity to prove that I can make a difference."
0,110,35,JACK,"You wanted to see me, Sir?"
0,110,35,HAMMOND,"I know this is not what you wanted to heard, but part of the deal to get the Stargate from the Russians involved agreeing to let one of their officers join SG-1."
0,110,35,JACK,This is the thanks I get for saving the world again?
0,110,35,HAMMOND,"I'm sorry, Jack. You're going to have to learn to live with this."
0,110,35,JACK,"Sir, can't we just throw them a bone? Give them their own unit. They'd be happy with that, wouldn't they?"
0,110,35,HAMMOND,What about SG-1?
0,110,35,JACK,"Actually, General ... I've already chosen our new team member."
0,110,36,HAMMOND,"Good luck, Colonel!"
0,110,36,JACK,"Thank you, Sir."
0,110,37,JONAS,How do I look?
0,110,37,SAM,Uh ... you might want to lose the helmet .
0,110,37,JACK,Good guess on the green.
0,110,37,JONAS,Thanks.
0,110,37,HAMMOND,
0,110,37,JACK,"Thank you, Sir."
