That was the first indication we had that the power sources fueling the 'gate technology have a limited life span. We've run a number of tests comparing the power source to other off world DHDs. We think we now have evidence that the 'gate we found down there is one of the oldest in the entire system. It could be as much as 50 million years old."""
