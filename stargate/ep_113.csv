0,113,1,SAM,"""Well, what the article didn't say...is that two years ago, he accepted a position with a company called Immunitech Research, which, it turns out, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zetatron Industries."""

0,113,1,JONAS,"""Who?"""
0,113,1,SAM,"""You don't know?"""
0,113,1,HAMMOND,"""Adrian Conrad was a man who had himself implanted with a stolen symbiote in order to cure himself of a deadly disease."""
0,113,1,SAM,"""That was ten months ago. At the time, Immunitech was located in Phoenix. One week after we took Adrian Conrad into custody, their operations were scaled back and they moved to a small town on the coast of Oregon called...Steveston."""
0,113,1,HAMMOND,"""We need to talk to this Dr. Flemming."""
0,113,1,SAM,"""He was reported missing this morning, sir. They found his car totaled, but there was no body."""
0,113,1,HAMMOND,"""This obviously warrants further investigation. I'll have transportation arranged for the three of you."""

0,113,6,SAM,"""That's right. I understand he's missing."""
0,113,6,KNOX,"""We found his car in a ditch outside of town. It was pretty badly smashed up, but there was no sign of him."""

0,113,7,SAM,"""You think he walked away from this?"""

0,113,7,KNOX,"""The people at Immunitech didn't mix too much with the locals, but according to his co-workers...he was acting a little strange, lately."""

0,113,11,SAM,"""This package to Dr. Richard Flemming was sent from Dr. Richard Flemming."""
0,113,11,JONAS,"""Why would he send something to himself?"""
0,113,11,SAM,"""Maybe he knew they were going to search the house. It's a good way to hide something for a few days."""
0,113,12,SAM,"""The police found amphetamines. We found a syringe. I think we need to at least admit there's a possibility that Dr. Flemming was suffering from some kind of drug-induced paranoia."""
0,113,12,TEAL'C,"""Perhaps his paranoia was well founded...He is missing. His place of work was destroyed and all evidence was removed from his home."""
0,113,12,SAM,"""Well, the scientists working for Adrian Conrad were studying the symbiote in order to create some kind of super drug. Maybe this is what they came up with."""
0,113,12,JONAS,"""Well, if that's true...then a lot of people would kill to get their hands on it."""
0,113,12,SAM,"""Well, we won't know anything for sure until we send a sample of this back to the base for analysis. I think tomorrow we should talk to other people who worked at Immunitech. We need to figure out what was going on at that lab."""
0,113,14,TOWNSPERSON,"""As some of you may already know, we have three uninvited guests in town. They are asking questions. The chances are they won't find anything. But, if they do...then we will have to deal with them."""

0,113,15,SAM,"""Nice lunch."""
0,113,15,JONAS,"""Mm. I'm really starting to enjoy this, uh, traditional American food. Mm."""

0,113,15,SAM,"""What are you talking about?"""
0,113,15,JONAS,"""Well, for instance, that man there, right behind Teal'c...he doesn't realize it, but he just put eight cubes of sugar into his coffee. And that lady over at the counter...she's been reading the same article for a half an hour. Since we sat down, that waitress has dropped her tray twice, the cook has gotten three orders wrong, including my hamburger, which I ordered medium rare but is in fact well done. I've been noticing similar behavior all morning. It's like, uh, the entire town's half asleep."""
0,113,16,DEPUTY,"""Major Carter...sorry to bother you. Sheriff Knox would like to see you."""
0,113,17,KNOX,
0,113,17,SAM,""" Yeah. Is that a problem?"""
0,113,17,KNOX,"""We found gasoline residue at the lab...a lot of it."""

0,113,17,SAM,"""The truth is...I didn't get any useful information this morning."""
0,113,17,KNOX,"""I'm not surprised. Everyone who worked at the lab had a confidentiality agreement. Nobody wants to get sued."""
0,113,17,SAM,"""Well, now that we know it was arson, maybe the company will be willing to cooperate."""
0,113,17,KNOX,""" I wouldn't be too sure about that."""
0,113,17,SAM,"""Well, they're gonna want to know who burned their lab down."""
0,113,17,KNOX,"""There's something you don't know. Two months ago, another Immunitech researcher named Peter Stofer disappeared. The case was never solved."""
0,113,17,SAM,"""Why didn't you tell me this?"""
0,113,17,KNOX,"""The town's been through some rough times, Major. Ship yard shut down two years ago...put everybody out of work. When Immunitech came along, they brought a lot of money to the area..."""
0,113,17,SAM,"""So, nobody wants to hear anything bad about them..."""
0,113,17,KNOX,"""There was no solid evidence of foul play in the Stofer case. He just didn't show up for work one day and hasn't been seen since. But I did get the feeling the company had something to hide."""

0,113,19,SAM,"""I'm gonna need to borrow these."""
0,113,19,SAM,"""Well, this is interesting. It's a shipping invoice. Flemming and Stofer ordered all the latest material on stem cell research."""
0,113,19,JONAS,"""Really?"" ""Hmm. There is no record of Immunitech doing that area. That's..."""
0,113,19,SAM,
0,113,19,TEAL'C,"""Why would they keep that a secret?"""
0,113,19,SAM,"""Well, stem cells can be used to create skin grafts or replacement organs, but theoretically, they can also be used to create human clones."""
0,113,19,JONAS,"""Which is illegal."""
0,113,19,SAM,"""So if they were doing some kind of cloning research and Flemming decided to blow the whistle..."""
0,113,19,TEAL'C,"""He would have to be silenced."""
0,113,19,JONAS,"""But why would he call you?"""
0,113,19,SAM,"""It must have something to do with Adrian Conrad. We should go through the rest of this stuff...see if anything turns up."""

0,113,23,TEAL'C,"""You have much to learn about humans."""
0,113,23,JONAS,"""That's kind of my point. How are we supposed to fit in when we spend all our time on base?"""

0,113,31,JONAS,"""Though of that, but he wasn't showing any of the signs of a hangover."""

0,113,35,DHM,"""Well, that's the weird part. He said that the people who were after him only come out during night while everyone's asleep.
