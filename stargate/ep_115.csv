0,115,0,SGT. DAVIS,"""We're receiving a transmission sir. Audio only."""
0,115,0,HAMMOND,"""Let's here it."" Garbled sound can be heard over the speakers."
0,115,0,SAM,"""I'll see if I can clean it up."""
0,115,0,VOICE OVER SPEAKER,"""Please respond. Repeat, this is Commander Hale, chairman of the Kelownan Defense Council, calling Stargate Command. Please respond."""
0,115,1,SAM,"""At approximately 0700 this morning, we received a transmission from P2S-4C3."""
0,115,1,HAMMOND,"""The man identified himself as Commander Hale, Chairman of the Kelownan Defense Council."""
0,115,1,JONAS,"""Well, he's been promoted. When I left, he was undersecretary for military appropriations."""
0,115,1,SAM,"""Well, according to their commander, the Kelownan government wants to reestablish trade relations with Earth."""
0,115,1,JACK,
0,115,1,HAMMOND,"""It's not that simple, Colonel."""
0,115,1,JACK,"""They tried to frame Daniel."""
0,115,1,JONAS,
0,115,1,TEAL'C,"""The Kelownans are technologically inferior to Earth. They have little to offer."""
0,115,1,SAM,"""Except Naquadria."""
0,115,1,JACK,"""Which...doesn't work."""
0,115,1,SAM,"""The hyperspace drive on the X-302 didn't work. That doesn't mean we should give up. Naquadria is still our best bet for creating shields and weapons capable of repelling the Goa'uld. We need this."""
0,115,1,TEAL'C,"""The Kelownan delegation will arrive soon."""
0,115,1,JONAS,"""Yeah."""
0,115,1,TEAL'C,"""Is there a problem, Jonas Quinn?"""
0,115,1,JONAS,"""I've just been, uh...so caught up in being a member of SG-1, I kinda forgot how this whole thing started."""
0,115,1,TEAL'C,"""We have taken similar paths. I, too, was forced to betray all of that in which I had placed my faith."""
0,115,1,JONAS,
0,115,1,TEAL'C,"""When I returned to Chulak after leaving the service of Apophis, I, too, was considered a traitor, Sholva, to my friends and family that I had left behind. In their eyes, I was dead."""
0,115,1,JONAS,"""It must have been hard for you to go back."""
0,115,1,TEAL'C,"""What I did, I did for my people. In time, they came to understand this."""
0,115,1,JONAS,"""Well...I don't think my people are ever gonna have a chance to know the truth."""
0,115,1,TEAL'C,"""Then you must draw strength in knowing that your cause is just...and one day your people will benefit from the sacrifices that you have made."""
0,115,1,HAMMOND,"""Welcome to Earth. I'm General Hammond."""
0,115,1,HALE,"""I'm Commander Hale. This is Ambassador Dreylock and Dr. Kieran."""
0,115,1,HAMMOND,"""This is Colonel O'Neill, Major Carter, Teal'c, and of course you know Jonas Quinn."""
0,115,1,JONAS,"""It's good to see you, Professor."""
0,115,1,KIERAN,"""General, I believe we have a lot to discuss."""
0,115,1,HAMMOND,"""Right this way."""
0,115,2,JACK,"""Friend of yours?"""
0,115,2,JONAS,"""He was, uh, one of my teachers at University and then he recruited me into the Naquadria project. We've been working together side by side the last six years..."""
0,115,3,HAMMOND,"""Please, sit down."" ""I must admit that we were a little surprised to hear from you given the circumstances of our last encounter."""
0,115,3,DREYLOCK,"""I'm sure we all regret what happened, but I don't think anything was said or done to damage relations between us irreparably."""
0,115,3,JACK,"""You accused a member of my team of sabotage to cover up your own incompetence."""
0,115,3,HALE,"""And you received stolen goods and are harboring a traitor."""
0,115,3,DREYLOCK,"""Perhaps it would be better if we focused on the matter at hand."""
0,115,3,HAMMOND,"""Which is what, exactly?"""
0,115,3,DREYLOCK,"""For several years, an uneasy peace has resulted from the rivalry between the three major powers on our planet - Kelowna, Tirania and the Andari Federation. All of that is about to change."""
0,115,3,HALE,"""According to our foreign intelligence service, the Tiranians and the Andaris are about to sign a non-aggression pact. This would leave us in a very vulnerable position."""
0,115,3,JACK,"""I'm just curious...what made you think we would care?"""
0,115,3,KIERAN,"""We still have something that you want, Colonel...Naquadria."""
0,115,3,DREYLOCK,"""In fact, thanks to recent discoveries...we have a considerable surplus."""
0,115,3,KIERAN,"""We know that you're decades ahead of us, technologically. In the field of jet propulsion alone, you could provide us with a significant strategic advantage."""
0,115,3,SAM,"""You want us to give you military technology."""
0,115,3,HALE,"""Without it, Kelowna faces annihilation."""
0,115,3,TEAL'C,"""You are assuming they intend to attack."""
0,115,3,HALE,"""The treaty is an obvious prelude to war. If we wait for them to make the first move, we won't stand a chance."""
0,115,3,JACK,"""See, we've been down this road before..."""
0,115,3,SAM,"""Uh, on a previous off-world mission, we encountered a race known as the Eurondans. They were losing a war and they offered us technology in exchange for our help. We then discovered that they were guilty of attempted genocide."""
0,115,3,DREYLOCK,
0,115,3,HAMMOND,
0,115,3,DREYLOCK,"""According to Mr. Quinn's original report, you regularly interfere in the affairs of a race known as the Goa'uld."""
0,115,3,JACK,"""Well, that's...a little different."""
0,115,3,SAM,"""The Goa'uld enslave millions of people across the galaxy."""
0,115,3,HALE,"""If you were to provide us with the means for a quick and decisive victory, you could potentially save hundreds of thousands of lives. If not, we would have no choice but to fall back on our last resort."""
0,115,3,DREYLOCK,"""Dr. Kieran and his team have successfully tested a Naquadria bomb. It's destructive power was beyond all expectations. If you do not help us, we will have no choice but to use it."""
0,115,3,TEAL'C,"""Do you believe the Kelownans are truly facing annihilation?"""
0,115,3,JONAS,"""Just before I left, we did a detailed projection based on this scenario. We calculated that the combined enemy forces would achieve total air superiority within the first five weeks of the war."""
0,115,3,SAM,"""So if the Kelownans are gonna to use the bomb, they'll have to do it fast."""
0,115,3,JONAS,"""They're probably considering a preemptive first strike."""
0,115,3,JACK,"""Really?"""
0,115,3,JONAS,"""Colonel, I helped research this report. If they stick with conventional weapons, we are looking at a complete collapse of their entire military within six months."""
0,115,3,SAM,"""Can't they negotiate? I mean, what are they fighting for anyway?"""
0,115,3,JONAS,"""Well, there's a thousand different grievances that go back generations. The last major conflict we had was 20 years ago...nothing was resolved. The only difference is that in the past the Tiranians and Andaris hated each other more than the Kelownans."""
0,115,3,JACK,"""Apparently, they got over it."""
0,115,3,JONAS,"""Oh it's a marriage of convenience. Sooner or later they'll turn on each other, but by then it'll be too late for Kelowna."""
0,115,3,JACK,"""Jonas...you're a member of SG-1 now. Your priorities have changed."""
0,115,4,JACK,"""You wanted to see me, sir?"""
0,115,4,HAMMOND,"""The Joint Chiefs are meeting in an hour. They're going to want me to give them a recommendation."""
0,115,4,JACK,"""We can't do it, sir."""
0,115,4,HAMMOND,"""You don't think we should help them defend themselves?"""
0,115,4,JACK,
0,115,4,HAMMOND,"""You sound like Dr. Jackson..."""
0,115,4,JACK,"""We spent some time together..."""
0,115,4,HAMMOND,"""But I have to wonder if this doesn't have more to do with your own personal distaste for the Kelownans..."""
0,115,4,JACK,"""Possibly, sir..."" Jack is interrupted by alarms klaxons."
0,115,4,VOICE OVER SPEAKER,"""Unscheduled off-world activation!"""
0,115,4,HAMMOND,"""Sgt.?"""
0,115,4,SGT. DAVIS,"""We're receiving a signal, sir. It's the Kelownans."""
0,115,4,HAMMOND,"""Open the iris."""
0,115,5,HAMMOND,"""Dr. Kieran..."""
0,115,5,KIERAN,
0,115,5,HAMMOND,"""My superiors will be meeting soon to discuss your situation."""
0,115,5,KEIRAN,"""In the mean time, I'd like to speak to Jonas Quinn."""
0,115,5,KIERAN,"""Jonas..."""
0,115,5,JONAS,"""Professor...uh, I didn't know that you were back."""
0,115,5,KIERAN,"""So this is where you're working now."""
0,115,5,JONAS,"""Yeah...when, uh, when I'm not off world."" ""Please."""
0,115,5,KIERAN,"""Off world...you must have seen some incredible things."""
0,115,5,JONAS,"""Yeah...you have no idea..."""
0,115,5,KIERAN,"""Well, you were always a dreamer, Jonas...but, of course, some of us had to stay behind to deal with reality."""
0,115,5,JONAS,"""Well, I had to leave. I mean, these people have a much better chance of doing something useful with the Naquadria than we ever had."""
0,115,5,KIERAN,"""What good is that to Kelowna?"""
0,115,5,JONAS,"""Well, if they can master shield technology, they'll share that with us."""
0,115,5,KIERAN,"""They won't even share their most basic military hardware."""
0,115,5,JONAS,"""That's because you come to them as a representative of only one nation. What the people on our planet need to do is to get over their differences and to unite."""
0,115,6,KIERAN,"""Do you really believe that?"""
0,115,6,JONAS,"""Of course."""
0,115,6,KIERAN,"""Then come with me now...and we could make it happen."""
0,115,6,JONAS,"""What are you talking about?"""
0,115,6,KIERAN,
0,115,6,JONAS,"""You're talking about a coup."""
0,115,6,KIERAN,"""When the time is right...but we need your help."""
0,115,6,JONAS,"""This is insane. I mean your telling me that you're part of a secret organization that is going to seize power from the government."""
0,115,6,KIERAN,"""That's right."""
0,115,6,JONAS,"""You're going to get yourself killed."""
0,115,6,KIERAN,"""On the contrary...this is our best chance for survival. There's wide-spread discontent with the government's hard-line war policy. That's true in Tirania and with the Andari Federation as well. The people of all three countries are sick of this never-ending conflict, but their leaders have stopped listening to them."""
0,115,6,JONAS,"""You really think you can succeed?"""
0,115,6,KIERAN,
0,115,6,HAMMOND,"""When are they going to move against the government?"""
0,115,6,JONAS,
0,115,6,TEAL'C,"""That will not prevent their enemies from attacking."""
0,115,6,JONAS,"""According to Dr. Kieran, there's popular support for a negotiated settlement in all three countries. Now they believe that if the resistance can seize power in Kelowna this will compel the other governments to come back to the table or risk similar uprisings. At the very least, they'll be too busy dealing with internal discontent to launch an attack."""
0,115,6,SAM,"""If they can pull it off, we might have a more viable trading partner."""
0,115,6,JACK,"""We need a lot more intel before we proceed with anything."""
0,115,6,HAMMOND,"""The Pentagon has authorized SG-1 to return to the planet and offer the Kelownan government non-military technology in exchange for Naquadria."""
0,115,6,JACK,"""They'll never go for it."""
0,115,6,HAMMOND,"""Maybe not, but we have to explore every avenue. In the meantime I want you to make contact with the resistance and determine their strength, their numbers and their chance for success."""
0,115,6,KIERAN,"""Are you ready to go home?"""
0,115,6,JONAS,"""Well, I'm not expecting a parade."""
0,115,6,KIERAN,"""Not everyone in Kelowna thinks you're a traitor. After you left, all of us working on the Naquadria project began to question what we were doing. You opened our eyes."""
0,115,6,JONAS,"""Anyway, it's just temporary. If I stay a minute after the negotiations are finished, I'll be arrested for treason."""
0,115,6,KIERAN,"""That will all change after the resistance takes power."""
0,115,7,JACK,"""All right. Let's move out."""
0,115,7,DREYLOCK,"""Hello again. I apologize for the delay but...these are difficult times for us. May I present First Minister Valis? Colonel O'Neill, Teal'c, Major Carter..."""
0,115,7,VALIS,"""...and Jonas Quinn. It's good to see you again, Jonas."""
0,115,7,JONAS,"""Thank you, sir."""
0,115,7,VALIS,"""Shall we?"""
0,115,7,DREYLOCK,"""Have you spoken with your superiors?"""
0,115,7,JACK,"""Why yes we have...they send their best."""
0,115,7,SAM,"""We've been authorized to continue with the trade negotiations."""
0,115,7,VALIS,"""Excellent."""
0,115,7,SAM,"""Before we continue...uh, there's something I'd like to clarify. Back on Earth, Ambassador Dreylock referred to recent discoveries leading to a surplus of Naquadria."""
0,115,7,VALIS,"""Yes, our archaeologists have discovered a series of mine shafts beneath the original site. We've managed to extract and process a considerable amount."""
0,115,7,SAM,"""How much?"""
0,115,7,VALIS,
0,115,7,SAM,"""Uh, that's an awful lot of dangerous material. If you like, I could take a look at your storage facilities. I might be able to offer some useful advice."""
0,115,7,HALE,"""That won't be necessary."""
0,115,7,VALIS,"""It's purely a matter of safety. As Major Carter said the Naquadria is extremely dangerous and we'd hate for some sort of accident to happen."""
0,115,7,JACK,"""Mmm."""
0,115,7,TEAL'C,"""Clearly you have more Naquadria than you require. What, precisely, are you asking for in return?"""
0,115,7,HALE,"""We need to start by addressing a serious imbalance in air power. Our enemies have superior numbers in both strategic bombers and long-range fighter escorts. Our only hope to counter them is to get our jet interceptor program off the ground."""
0,115,7,VALIS,"""We've had some technical difficulties with the program, but we have managed to successfully test a few designs. We believe that with the help of Major Carter and a team of your engineers, we can have a combat-ready squadron in less than a month."""
0,115,7,JACK,"""Well, that's not exactly what we had in mind."""
0,115,7,SAM,"""We understand from Jonas that Kelownan medical science currently has little or no defense against bacterial infections. We're offering a series of drugs known as antibiotics. We estimate they could save up to 15,000 lives in the first year alone."""
0,115,7,VALIS,"""That's a generous offer, Major, and under different circumstances, we might accept. But at the moment, we have more pressing needs."""
0,115,7,DR. KIERAN,"""So, how are the negotiations coming?"""
0,115,7,JONAS,"""Well, after four hours...the only thing we could agree on was to adjourn for the day."""
0,115,7,SAM,"""We're clear, sir, no bugs."""
0,115,7,TEAL'C,
0,115,7,KIERAN,"""They know how much you want the Naquadria and they think that eventually you're going to give them what they want."""
0,115,7,JACK,"""In the meantime, we need you to take us to this...resistance."""
0,115,7,KIERAN,"""Well, it's not that simple. I don't get in touch with them, they get in touch with me."""
0,115,7,SAM,"""What exactly do you do for them?"""
0,115,7,KIERAN,
0,115,7,JACK,"""Where do you meet them?"""
0,115,7,KIERAN,"""They have a base of operations in an old warehouse by the freight yards. It's very heavily guarded."""
0,115,7,JACK,"""Take us there."""
0,115,7,KIERAN,
0,115,7,JONAS,"""Professor..."""
0,115,7,KIERAN,"""All right...I'll...I'll talk to them."""
0,115,7,RESISTANCE LEADER,"""We weren't expecting you this evening, Professor."""
0,115,7,KIERAN,"""I'm sorry. I needed to talk to you."""
0,115,7,RESISTANCE LEADER,"""This isn't a very good time to be taking risks. We've had reports that some members of the government are beginning to questions your loyalty. They've been watching you."
0,115,7,KIERAN,
0,115,7,RESISTANCE LEADER,"""Is this about the delegation from Earth?"""
0,115,7,KIERAN,"""Uh, yes, they want to meet with you."""
0,115,7,RESISTANCE LEADER,"""Well, how do you know they won't betray us to the government in exchange for Naquadria?"""

0,115,7,JONAS,"""It's not easy for me either...but I made my choices and I'm going to stick by them."""
0,115,7,VALIS,"""I'm sure you thought you were...doing the right thing."""
0,115,7,JONAS,"""Oh, I know I did the right thing. Stargate Command is going to use the Naquadria to come up with technologies that may one day save this world from an enemy...you can't possibly imagine."""
0,115,7,VALIS,"""You were one of the most...promising young men any of us had ever seen. Our people had such high hopes for you."""
0,115,7,JONAS,"""You're not the only one who was disappointed."""
0,115,7,VALIS,
0,115,7,JONAS,"""Then get back to the negotiating table. Give up some land. You do whatever it takes..."""
0,115,7,VALIS,"""You know how much the Tiranians and the Andaris hate each other. Do you really think that they overcame 200 years of prejudice just to get us to give up a little land? They mean to destroy us, Jonas. This is merely the first step in a fight for world domination and the Naquadria is the only advantage that we have...and that is where you come in, my friend."""
0,115,7,JONAS,
0,115,7,VALIS,"""You're a man of unique talents, Jonas...and despite what you did, I know that it's not too late for you to serve your country. I'm offering you a second chance to do that."""
0,115,7,JONAS,"""If you're asking me to gather information about Earth technology, that's not going to happen. I will not betray my friends."""
0,115,7,VALIS,"""On the contrary, I'm asking you to help a friend. Dr. Kieran hasn't been the same since you left. Unfortunately, the strain of completing the Naquadria project has...has taken its toll. Lately, his behavior has become increasingly...erratic."""
0,115,7,JONAS,"""How do you mean?"""
0,115,7,VALIS,"""We're concerned that in his current state, he may be prone to errors of judgment. We want someone to...watch over him."""
0,115,7,JONAS,"""You mean spy on him?"""
0,115,7,VALIS,"""He trusts you, Jonas, and he's still very important to us. If you do this, you will be granted a full pardon. You'll be reinstated into your position at the academy. Your life will resume as though none of this had ever happened. It's time, Jonas, for you to come home."""
0,115,7,KIERAN,"""Oh, I'm tired."""
0,115,8,JONAS,"""You've been under a lot of strain."""

0,115,8,HALE,"""It's purely a defensive technology."""

0,115,11,JONAS,"""Looks like it's time you did. Think about it. If everybody knew that this was just one in thousands of inhabited planets, don't you think that they would start focusing on their similarities instead of their differences?"""
0,115,11,VALIS,"""That's a noble sentiment, Jonas. Of course, if it were that simple, I'm sure the existence of the Stargate would be public knowledge on Earth, as well. Isn't that right, Colonel?"""
