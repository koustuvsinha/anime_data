0,118,0,DOLLEN,"""Calm yourself, Commander."""
0,118,0,TEGAR,"""We are about to meet an alien race in person for the first time. If you are correct, they are more advanced than us and capable of being a significant threat. That gives me good reason to be on the highest alert."""
0,118,1,DOLLEN,"""Since the discovery of the temple ruins, we have had reason to believe that there are other inhabited planets in the galaxy and now finally, we have our proof. I, for one, am relieved that the very first contact that we have made is with a race of humans that seem to be very much like us."""
0,118,1,TEGAR,"""Maybe you trust them without suspicion, but I cannot."""
0,118,1,DOLLEN,"""Nevertheless Commander, we must proceed."""
0,118,2,DOLLEN,"""They are sending their most respected team of representatives. No doubt, the leader of this group will be a brilliant and savvy negotiator."""
0,118,2,TEGAR,"""We must be at our best to match the challenge."""
0,118,2,DOLLEN,"""Personally, I cannot wait to meet a man of such genius."""
0,118,3,JACK,"""Howdy, folks."""
0,118,4,JACK,"""Nice."""
0,118,4,DOLLEN,"""Thank you, Colonel. We would be happy to take you on a full tour of our city, but first, we would like to spend a little time talking about our mutual interests. So, please, please, sit."""
0,118,5,DOLLEN,"""To be honest, we are still trying to adjust to the fact that our...Stargate, as you call it...is no longer a mere relic of a bygone era."""
0,118,5,TEGAR,"""Obviously, it was quite a shock when your communication machine appeared last month."""
0,118,5,SAM,"""First contact can be somewhat unnerving."""
0,118,5,DOLLEN,"""Well, we are all very pleased to finally get the chance to talk face to face."""
0,118,5,TEGAR,"""From our study of the ancient temple, we have been able to deduce the Stargate was an interplanetary transportation device..."""
0,118,5,DOLLEN,"""...but we haven't determined how to make a connection with the many worlds described in the writings in the temple."""
0,118,5,CARTER,"""It took us a while to get the hang of it too."""
0,118,5,DOLLEN,"""We know that the symbols on the Stargate itself are the key, but as for the number and sequence to enter in the dialing device..."""
0,118,5,JONAS,"""We can definitely help you out there."""
0,118,5,SAM,"""Once we get to know you a little better."""
0,118,5,DOLLEN,"""Oh, yes, well, of course. We intend to allow you full access to our...our citizens, our history, our culture, so that you may come to trust us."""
0,118,5,JACK,
0,118,5,DOLLEN,"""We also want to make it clear that we intend to offer all that we can in trade for any knowledge or technology that you are willing to share."""
0,118,6,JACK,"""Qu'est-ce que c'est?"""
0,118,6,DOLLEN,"""We call it Tretonin, Colonel. It is our greatest scientific discovery."""
0,118,6,SAM,"""How so?"""
0,118,6,DOLLEN,"""Major Carter, from what you have told me about your world, your people suffer from a myriad of illnesses. Many of them are untreatable. Tretonin makes our immune systems impervious to any ailment. We live in perfect health."""

0,118,7,ZENNA,
0,118,7,JONAS,"""Well, we're not originally from there..."""

0,118,7,ZENNA,"""Am I at least correct in assuming you are Jaffa?"""
0,118,7,TEAL'C,"""Indeed."""
0,118,7,ZENNA,
0,118,7,JONAS,
0,118,7,ZENNA,"""By all means, that was my intention. We first discovered these ruins over a hundred years ago and since then, we've dedicated ourselves to studying the secrets the Goa'uld left behind. This area was obviously some sort of reception colonnade for greeting travelers who came through the Stargate. The real discovery was made just over here."""
0,118,7,DOLLEN,"""Although we fully admit Tretonin is not without side effects, we assure you, the good it can do far outweighs any negative aspects."""
0,118,7,SAM,"""What kind of side effects are we talking about, exactly?"""
0,118,7,TEGAR,"""It depends on the individual. Most people experience almost no reaction to it. Those who do merely require more regulated doses."""
0,118,7,SAM,"""We'll need a decent amount for testing..."""
0,118,7,JACK,"""...on Earth, of course."""
0,118,7,DOLLEN,"""Yes, certainly."""
0,118,7,TEGAR,"""Of course, we will need something in return from you, as a measure of good faith."""
0,118,7,SAM,"""We've been authorized to give you these ten addresses and a rudimentary lesson in 'gate technology. These are all peaceful planets, safe from hostile forces, rich with historical relics and natural resources."""
0,118,7,DOLLEN,"""Well, this is a very generous offer, Major, very generous. However, based on our own studies of the writings in the temple, we have compiled a list of the names of the worlds that we would like to visit."""
0,118,8,JACK,"""Do you recognize any of these?"""
0,118,8,SAM,"""Well, I'll have to cross-reference the Goa'uld names with our database of Stargate addresses, but off-hand, I recognize these three, sir. They're classified off-limits: Goa'uld homeworlds."""
0,118,8,JACK,"""Yeah, uh, fellas...you really don't wanna go here. Not exactly a walk in the park, you know what I mean?"""
0,118,8,TEGAR,"""We know the Goa'uld are a hostile race that once ruled this planet centuries ago."""
0,118,8,JACK,"""All right, you're new to this, so I'll cut you a break..."""
0,118,8,TEGAR,"""Those are the worlds we wish to explore."""
0,118,8,DOLLEN,"""We believe that they are significant to our history."""
0,118,8,JACK,"""Look, guys, we're not lying to you about this...you don't wanna go there first time out. Trust me."""
0,118,8,TEGAR,"""If you have been to these worlds and survived, can we not?"""
0,118,8,JACK,"""All I'm tryin' to say to you is...it would be stupid."""
0,118,8,TEGAR,"""We are aware of the risks and believe the rewards are worth the potential consequences, as you and your people obviously do, Colonel."""
0,118,8,DOLLEN,"""Please, Colonel, in exchange for the Tretonin, we are simply asking that you respect our wishes."""
0,118,8,ZENNA,"""There is an underground tunnel system that leads to the main temple."""
0,118,8,TEAL'C,"""It is most likely a means of escape to the Stargate in case of an attack."""
0,118,8,ZENNA,"""That's exactly what I thought."" ""Please."""
0,118,8,TIME JUMP,Inside the temple.
0,118,8,ZENNA,"""The writing in this chamber seem to tell the story of the Goa'uld who once ruled here. We've been attempting to decipher this section of the wall for many months. Thus far, with limited success."""
0,118,8,TEAL'C,"""It is written in a rare dialect of ancient Goa'uld...an account of the warlord Shak'ran."""
0,118,8,JONAS,"""He was a system lord who was eventually defeated by Apophis about 300 years ago."""
0,118,8,TEAL'C,"""Indeed. Until his defeat it appears Pangar served as Shak'ran's homeworld."""
0,118,8,ZENNA,"""And what of the Goa'uld Apophis? The one who conquered Shak'ran?"""
0,118,8,TEAL'C,"""He was killed in battle, not long ago."""
0,118,8,ZENNA,"""As I suspected, you have much wisdom to share."""
0,118,8,JONAS,"""Teal'c and I'll be more than happy to help you out with the translations. I've got at least a dozen ancient ciphers I can try..."""
0,118,8,ZENNA,"""Please...I do not wish to be overheard by the Pangar security contingent. There is something you need to know about the Tretonin..."" ""Please come with me and I will finish showing you the rest of the ruins."" ""I will try to talk to you later."""
0,118,8,TIME JUMP,Outside the ruins. Jonas and Teal'c are meeting up with Sam and Jack.
0,118,8,TEAL'C,"""She said there was something we needed to know about the Tretonin..."""
0,118,8,JONAS,"""...and she seemed to be worried about these guys, like she was going way out on a limb just talking to us about something other than Goa'uld hieroglyphs."""
0,118,8,JACK,"""All right. You guys keep digging. See what you can find. Carter and I'll take this sample back to the SGC."""

0,118,11,TIME JUMP,"It's nighttime. Jonas and Teal'c are sneaking into the Tretonin facility through an underground tunnel entrance. They walk along with flashlights. They come upon what looks like a lab. There are several bottles on a table, some of which look just like the one give to Sam and Jack."
0,118,11,JONAS,"""Looks like this is where they actually make the drug as well as administer it."""

0,118,19,SAM,"""Excuse me?"""
0,118,19,DOLLEN,"""It is a complicated process, one which is better explained by our scientists. Quite frankly, we intended to tell you how the Tretonin was made, eventually. We just wanted to first assess how you might react."""

0,118,19,TEGAR,
0,118,19,JONAS,"""Do you really understand the risks involved?"""

0,118,19,JACK,"""Yeah, for people who haven't mastered 'gate travel, you sure got a lot of 'em."""
0,118,19,TEAL'C,"""We would require answers before sharing any further information about the Stargate."""
0,118,19,TEGAR,"""We have already told you everything that is necessary."""
0,118,19,DOLLEN,"""Tegar, the Colonel is right. There is no reason to keep more secrets."""
0,118,19,DOLLEN,"""The drug was developed and is now manufactured and administered here...and since it's use has spread to more of the general population, we've, uh, implemented other treatment centers throughout Pangar as well. Now, through here is the reason we were able to create Tretonin in the first place. The symbiotes were not procured through 'gate travel."" ""Our symbiotes are all bred here in captivity."""

0,118,20,JACK,"""Teal'c?"""
0,118,20,TEAL'C,"""Prior to the process of incubating Goa'uld symbiotes using Jaffa, the blending between Goa'uld and host had only a one-in-two chance of success. The Jaffa were created for the very reason of improving the ability of the symbiote to take human hosts."""

0,118,20,TEAL'C,"""This I do not know."""
0,118,20,SAM,"""Colonel, I recommend we contact the Tok'ra. They may have a deeper understanding into this man's condition and in the very least they may be able to take the symbiote out of him."""
