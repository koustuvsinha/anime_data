0,119,0,SCENE 2,Jack and Harry are driving in an SUV discussing that Harry had been paid three million dollars for a symbiote he acquired from the Russians.
0,119,0,SCENE 3,"Teal'c, Daniel, and Hammond are sitting around the conference table in the briefing room as Janet hands out folders and tells them that Adrian Conrad is suffering from Burchart's Syndrome and that there is no cure. Teal'c replies, ""Except the healing powers of a Goa'uld symbiote."""
0,119,0,SCENE 4,"Jack is holding a gun on the Goa'ulded Conrad in the steam tunnels beneath the hospital when he is shot by Simmons. Simmons tells Conrad, ""You want to live; you come with me."""
0,119,0,SCENE 5,"Simmons is standing, talking to Conrad, who is sitting at a table. Simmons and Conrad are negotiating for information. Conrad tells Simmons he has nothing that equals the value of the information he can provide. Simmons replies, ""I'm not so sure about that."""

0,119,0,JULIA,"""Actually, your name came up in connection with a story I've been working on.

0,119,1,DAVIS,"""I'd advise against it."""
0,119,1,AL,"""Okay, Okay...look, maybe there's a compromise here. Whatever this thing is...I figure it's too big to stay secret forever. Am I right? Eventually, you're gonna go public.
