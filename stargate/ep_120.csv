0,120,0,"""UNNATURAL SELECTION""",By Brad Wright
0,120,0,ONEILL,"Thor, buddy. Theres no way."
0,120,0,THOR,The Replicators will soon consume all that they can within our home galaxy. Yours will be next.
0,120,0,ONEILL,I thought we were too primitive to consume?
0,120,0,THOR,Your technology would not immediately attract the Replicators but they would eventually be drawn to the raw materials of which your civilisation is built. Your extinction will be assured.
0,120,0,CARTER,"For that matter, so would every other world weve visited. Its just a matter of time."
0,120,0,JONAS,Did all of the Asgard manage to escape?
0,120,0,THOR,"Most, but not all. A great battle was fought. The evacuation fleet is standing by in the void between our two galaxies awaiting to hear word of your response."
0,120,0,ONEILL,My response?
0,120,0,THOR,We have done all that we can and failed ONeill. You and your team represent our last hope.
0,120,0,ONEILL,"Yeah, great. So no pressure, right?"
0,120,0,THOR,"If you have in fact made your decision not to undertake this task, I will inform the council."
0,120,0,ONEILL,"Just give me a minute here, okay?"
0,120,0,TEALC,Are you reconsidering ONeill?
0,120,0,ONEILL,Im considering re-considering.
0,120,0,JONAS,Well there has to be other options.
0,120,0,THOR,We believe there is no alternative plan of action.
0,120,0,CARTER,"Thor, I dont think youre realising what youre asking us to do."
0,120,0,THOR,In the past your projectile weapons have been most effective.
0,120,0,ONEILL,Well we dont have any projectile weapons with us at the moment and according to Carter were a long way from...
0,120,1,ONEILL,Home.
0,120,1,CARTER,You towed us back into Earths orbit.
0,120,1,THOR,"Correct Major Carter. The contents of your armoury at Stargate Command along with the appropriate attire, food and other supplies you may require are now being transported aboard this vessel."
0,120,1,ONEILL,I hope you did the paperwork.
0,120,1,CARTER,"Wait a minute, we have a few passengers.."
0,120,1,THOR,They are being transported to Stargate Command.
0,120,1,ONEILL,I havent said yes yet.
0,120,1,THOR,But you are reconsidering.
0,120,1,ONEILL,Im leaning in the general direction.
0,120,2,ONEILL,"Hey, what are you doing?"
0,120,2,CARTER,Were leaving the solar system.
0,120,2,ONEILL,"Thor, little fella. Its not the way it works. Its not my ship. Its not up to me."
0,120,2,THOR,The journey to our home galaxy will take many hours with your vessel in tow. You may consult your superiors en route.
0,120,3,HAMMOND,Sergeant?
0,120,3,SILER,"I cant explain it Sir. Its like everything in the armoury just disappeared. P90s, SPAZ 12s, SAWs, claymores. Everything."
0,120,3,DAVIS,"Sir. Four of the people who commandeered the X 303 just appeared out of thin air in the holding room. Air Force personnel, a reporter just beamed into the cafeteria kitchen up on Level 22. Half the food stores went missing at the same time."
0,120,3,HAMMOND,Youre certain the Stargates been inactive?
0,120,3,DAVIS,Yes sir.
0,120,3,HAMMOND,What in Gods name is happening?
0,120,4,ONEILL,"Hello, sir. Siler, how you doing?"
0,120,4,HAMMOND,Colonel. Its good to see you alive and well. We were concerned the X 303 was lost with all hands.
0,120,4,ONEILL,"No sir, were all fine. Except for the Goauld and Simmons of course."
0,120,4,HAMMOND,So you were rescued by the Asgard?
0,120,4,ONEILL,"Actually it kinda looks like well be coming to their rescue, sir."
0,120,4,HAMMOND,Does that have anything to do with the supplies and equipment that are disappearing from all over my base?
0,120,4,ONEILL,"Yes sir. Sufficed to say, you might want to get upstairs and punch one on the old speed dial."
0,120,4,HAMMOND,My grandchildren?
0,120,4,ONEILL,Two then. I think the President might want to know what the Asgard have in mind for our new ship.
0,120,5,ONEILL,They didnt go for it.
0,120,5,CARTER,They didnt approve the mission?
0,120,5,ONEILL,"Oh no, they did that. Once they knew the stakes and the fate of the universe stuff. Both the President and Hammond realised we had no choice. He sends good luck, godspeed and all those things he says when he thinks were gonna die."
0,120,5,CARTER,So what didnt they go for?
0,120,5,ONEILL,The name I suggested.
0,120,5,CARTER,For the ship?
0,120,5,ONEILL,Yeah.
0,120,5,CARTER,"Yeah Sir, we cant call it the Enterprise."
0,120,5,ONEILL,Why not?
0,120,5,CARTER,The codename for the project is Prometheus. Whats wrong with that?
0,120,5,ONEILL,Its a Greek tragedy. Who wants that?
0,120,5,CARTER,Okay. The X303 it is then.
0,120,5,ONEILL,Yeah. What have you got there?
0,120,5,CARTER,"Well, the Asgard surmised that the Replicators probably disabled the time dilation device by destroying the control interface mechanism."
0,120,5,ONEILL,Uh-huh.
0,120,5,CARTER,"Well, its really not much more than an advanced timer. But since any Asgard technology we took along would cause the Replicators to swarm all over us. Thor had a facsimile of their interface built from Earth based materials. Itll work just as well as the original but it shouldnt attract the Replicators."
0,120,5,ONEILL,Im hungry.
0,120,5,CARTER,"Cargo bay three, sir."
0,120,5,ONEILL,Thanks.
0,120,7,ONEILL,You guys trying to make yourself sick?
0,120,7,JONAS,Well Thor forgot to take the need for refrigeration into account so we figured wed start with the frozen stuff. This is good. Mmmm.
0,120,7,ONEILL,Ill buy that.
0,120,8,ONEILL,"So Jonas, first time going up against a Replicator, eh?"
0,120,9,JONAS,I think I have a pretty good idea of what to expect though. Tealc told me all about them and I have everything Dr Jackson wrote. Theyre fascinating.
0,120,9,ONEILL,Fascinating?
0,120,9,JONAS,"Well think about it. We have a human scientist who creates this android girl who then goes on to create these Replicators as a toy. Well at least the concept of something that starts out so innocent become so evil, well thats got to be fascinating to you."
0,120,9,TEALC,Replicators exist merely to increase their numbers and do so without prejudice. They are no more evil that a virus.
0,120,9,ONEILL,A really evil virus.
0,120,9,JONAS,Well yes we can all agree that any living thing that isnt inherently evil in itself is capable of undertaking actions that are evil.
0,120,10,TEALC,We are slowing.
0,120,10,CARTER,"Colonel, you should come forward, Sir."
0,120,10,ONEILL,Were on our way.
0,120,11,CARTER,
0,120,11,THOR,We dare proceed no further without risk of engaging the Replicators. You will have to continue from this point on your own ship's power.
0,120,11,ONEILL,"But youre gonna wait here for us, right?"
0,120,11,THOR,There is now another concern. Our long-range sensors have discovered the time dilation device was indeed activated.
0,120,11,ONEILL,Well thats good. Its not good?
0,120,11,THOR,Time is now progressing faster within the field.
0,120,11,CARTER,They reversed it?
0,120,11,THOR,By a factor of ten squared.
0,120,11,ONEILL,"What is with you people? Time machines are nothin but trouble, even we know that."
0,120,11,TEALC,Clearly the Replicators have discovered a means of utilising the time dilation machine to serve their own purpose.
0,120,11,JONAS,Well what would that purpose be?
0,120,11,ONEILL,"Well, I gotta tell you this changes things. Carter, how does this change things?"
0,120,11,CARTER,"I dont know, Sir. I guess it doesnt."
0,120,11,ONEILL,You mean weve got the same problem we had an hour ago.
0,120,11,CARTER,"Well the difference is, in that hour, four days have passed for the Replicators. Depending on when they did this, relatively speaking, they could have experienced hundreds of years."
0,120,11,ONEILL,I get it.
0,120,11,THOR,If you wish to reconsider...
0,120,11,ONEILL,No. No. Full well expected the other shoe to drop eventually.
0,120,11,THOR,We can only hope this will be the last footwear to fall. The co-ordinates to the planet have already been programmed into your navigational computer. We have modified your engines and structural integrity fields to their maximum potential to assure your safe arrival. We will monitor your progress as best we can. Good Luck.
0,120,13,CARTER,Setting course to programmed co ordinates. Throttling up sub light engines.
0,120,15,ONEILL,Again.
0,120,15,JONAS,My hands are covered in blisters. Theyre not gonna work any faster.
0,120,15,CARTER,"Colonel, were about to pass through into the time dilation field."
0,120,15,ONEILL,Were on our way.
0,120,15,TEALC,A replicator controlled vessel approaches.
0,120,15,CARTER,Hopefully theyll agree with Thor and think this ships a piece of junk.
0,120,15,TEALC,They are scanning us.
0,120,15,CARTER,"Sir, were being scanned by the Replicators ship. Stand by."
0,120,15,ONEILL,We still in business?
0,120,15,TEALC,Indeed.
0,120,15,CARTER,"Yes Sir, its moving off. Its like were clear to enter the planets atmosphere."
0,120,17,CARTER,Were detecting one structure at the designated co-ordinates.
0,120,17,ONEILL,Just the one?
0,120,17,TEALC,There appears to be little topography of any kind.
0,120,17,JONAS,Two hundred metres.
0,120,17,CARTER,Throttling down to fifty percent.
0,120,17,JONAS,One five zero metres.
0,120,17,CARTER,The surface appears to be completely smooth.
0,120,17,JONAS,One hundred metres.
0,120,17,TEALC,No sign of Replicators.
0,120,17,CARTER,Deceleration thrusters are firing.
0,120,17,JONAS,Five zero metres.
0,120,17,CARTER,The inertial compensators and structural integrity are at maximum. Landing struts are at full extension.
0,120,18,ONEILL,What was that?
0,120,18,CARTER,Lightning sir. All systems are still go.
0,120,18,JONAS,Ten metres.
0,120,19,JONAS,Five metres.
0,120,20,JONAS,Touchdown.
0,120,20,CARTER,Shutting down thrusters.
0,120,21,ONEILL,Get a message to Thor. Let him know we touched down. Lets move out.
0,120,22,JONAS,This cant be the only structure on the entire planet.
0,120,22,ONEILL,Id be willing to bet the bugs ate everything else.
0,120,22,JONAS,Then where are they?
0,120,23,CARTER,Sir. Youre not gonna like this.
0,120,23,JONAS,What is it?
0,120,23,TEALC,This planet's surface appears to be covered with Replicator blocks.
0,120,23,CARTER,Probably more than one layer and who knows how thick it is. Maybe miles.
0,120,23,JONAS,Why would that be?
0,120,23,CARTER,"Well it could be a by-product of the reverse time dilation. In relative time, theyve been here hundreds of years but theres nothing left here to consume so theyre just conserving energy."
0,120,23,JONAS,Whats keeping them here?
0,120,23,ONEILL,Who cares. Watch your step.
0,120,25,CARTER,Sir the original interface is still intact. I might be able to...
0,120,26,FIFTH,Who are you?
0,120,26,ONEILL,"Colonel Jack ONeill, US Air Force, Earth. Who are you?"
0,120,26,FIFTH,The others are coming.
0,120,27,FIRST,What do you think you are doing?
0,120,27,ONEILL,"Clocks are running a little fast around here. Thought wed stop by, wind em. Well be on our way."
0,120,27,FIRST,"Your companion is attempting to alter the settings on the time device and we cannot allow that. If she does not stop immediately, we will be forced to take action."
0,120,27,ONEILL,"Well; now, if you do that, we might be forced to take our own action."
0,120,27,FIRST,Tell your companion to stop.
0,120,27,ONEILL,"Carter, how much time you need there?"
0,120,27,CARTER,"A lot, Sir. Maybe a few hours."
0,120,27,ONEILL,Hours?
0,120,27,CARTER,"Sir, the interface was completely rebuilt. Im not even sure where to start."
0,120,27,ONEILL,Couldnt you crank it up a little bit? Move things along?
0,120,27,CARTER,It doesnt work that way sir.
0,120,27,FIRST,"Ironic, isnt it?"
0,120,27,ONEILL,Who are you people? Because if you havent noticed this entire planet is paved with replicators.
0,120,27,FIRST,We are aware of this.
0,120,27,ONEILL,Then you should also know that these things have taken millions of lives and theyll keep on doing that unless we stop them.
0,120,27,SECOND,He doesnt understand.
0,120,27,ONEILL,"You know, hes standing right here."
0,120,27,FIRST,"We cannot allow you to stop them, Im afraid."
0,120,27,ONEILL,Why not?
0,120,27,FIRST,We are replicators.
0,120,27,ONEILL,Ah.
0,120,28,FIRST,Tell your companion to step away from the device.
0,120,28,ONEILL,Carter.
0,120,29,FIRST,Your projectile weapon?
0,120,29,ONEILL,"Yeah, you know, I think well hang onto those for a while."
0,120,30,FIRST,Now there is no need.
0,120,31,FIRST,"Where are my manners? This is something of an occasion after all, isnt it? Our first meeting. Welcome."
0,120,32,FIRST,"Colonel, if we really intended you harm, do you believe you would be standing there? As I said, welcome."
0,120,34,FIRST,We are inside your unconscious mind now.
0,120,34,ONEILL,Youd think thered be more lights on.
0,120,34,FIRST,This place must be important to you.
0,120,34,ONEILL,I work here.
0,120,34,FIRST,Your iris code is 903224637.
0,120,34,ONEILL,"Wow, thats.... close. Heres one for you. Im thinking of an animal."
0,120,34,FIRST,I never expected that you would amuse me.
0,120,34,ONEILL,I never expected you to put your hand in my head.
0,120,34,FIRST,Your mind is incredible.
0,120,34,ONEILL,Well...
0,120,34,FIRST,Such chaos and humour and pain.
0,120,35,FIRST,"Youre correct to blame yourself, your son would be alive but for your carelessness."
0,120,35,ONEILL,Dont do that again.
0,120,35,FIRST,That will be your punishment each time you attempt to conceal something from me on our journey.
0,120,36,ONEILL,Where we going?
0,120,36,FIRST,Every place you have ever been.
0,120,38,ONEILL,Crap! Holy Jesus!
0,120,39,ONEILL,Carter! Jonas!
0,120,40,JONAS,Her hand was inside my head. It was like a .... It was like a nightmare.
0,120,40,CARTER,I think we all had a similar experience. I dont remember much of it.
0,120,40,TEALC,Nor do I.
0,120,40,ONEILL,How long were we out?
0,120,40,CARTER,Thirty-seven hours sir. Ship time.
0,120,40,JONAS,Why would they bring us back here?
0,120,40,TEALC,Perhaps we can take advantage of the situation.
0,120,40,CARTER,"Detonate the hyperdrive, you mean. An overload would cause a pretty big explosion."
0,120,40,ONEILL,Big enough to be worth it?
0,120,40,CARTER,"I honestly dont know, Sir."
0,120,40,ONEILL,Go.
0,120,41,ONEILL,Get a message to Thor. Let him know how massively he screwed up.
0,120,42,JONAS,"Hey Colonel. Colonel, I dont think this is going to work."
0,120,42,ONEILL,If Carter says she can do it....
0,120,42,JONAS,"Yeah, but if explosives and weapons worked, the Asgard would have won their war."
0,120,42,ONEILL,I suppose you want to talk to these bug people?
0,120,42,JONAS,Dont you?
0,120,42,ONEILL,No.
0,120,42,JONAS,"Maybe we can reason with them. If we blow this ship, then we lose that option altogether."
0,120,42,ONEILL,"If we blow the ship, I wont care."
0,120,42,JONAS,"Colonel, I dont think that you fully appreciate what theyve become."
0,120,42,ONEILL,Replicators who look like we do.
0,120,42,JONAS,"More than that. Sir, this is a huge leap in their evolution."
0,120,42,ONEILL,Jonas! They are replicators.
0,120,43,ONEILL,Carter? Whats going on?
0,120,43,CARTER,"Everythings fine, Sir. We were just chatting. He carried us back here, Sir. One at a time. So wed be more comfortable."
0,120,43,JONAS,Thanks.
0,120,43,FIFTH,It was not difficult.
0,120,43,CARTER,"Apparently Sir, were invited to dinner."
0,120,43,FIFTH,At his request.
0,120,43,ONEILL,Whos?
0,120,43,FIFTH,First.
0,120,43,ONEILL,And you are?
0,120,43,FIFTH,I was Fifth. The others are merging with our replicator brethren but they will return soon.
0,120,43,ONEILL,"Yeah, you wanna let him know weve made other plans?"
0,120,43,FIFTH,Exploding your vessel would only serve to feed energy to the replicator blocks on the surface of the planet. Your food stores have already been taken to the temple.
0,120,43,JONAS,When are we expected?
0,120,43,FIFTH,When you become hungry.
0,120,44,JONAS,That ones different.
0,120,44,CARTER,No kidding. I mean he comes across as almost human.
0,120,44,ONEILL,Well hes not.
0,120,44,CARTER,So what do we do?
0,120,44,JONAS,Can we leave?
0,120,44,CARTER,"The ship will fly but I dont know how far well get. Sir, if this really is the next evolution of the replicators we should find out as much as possible about them and try to report it back somehow."
0,120,44,ONEILL,Anyone hungry?
0,120,46,FIRST,Colonel ONeill. Major Carter. Tealc. Jonas. Welcome.
0,120,46,ONEILL,Youll forgive us if we dont shake your hands this time.
0,120,46,FIRST,Please sit and replenish yourselves. Organic forms store energy so inefficiently.
0,120,46,ONEILL,Yeah. I assume youre Sixth.
0,120,46,SIXTH,Yes.
0,120,46,FIRST,Our newest addition.
0,120,46,ONEILL,"Youre kinda going girl, boy, girl, boy."
0,120,46,CARTER,"Sir, the entire table..."
0,120,46,ONEILL,I see that.
0,120,47,JONAS,We still have some questions that we never got a chance to ask last time we met.
0,120,47,FIRST,"When our replicator brethren discovered the android Reese, they realised she was their creator. They studied her design and form and found aspects of her technology superior to their own."
0,120,47,SECOND,Our brethren are composed of ungainly blocks.
0,120,47,THIRD,We are composed of millions of cell units. Microscopic in comparison that combine to create this form.
0,120,47,CARTER,"Like nanites, Sir."
0,120,47,ONEILL,I hate those things.
0,120,47,FIRST,My creation took place in the last moment before the Asgard time device was to activate. There was a miniscule crack in the neutronium shell. I could penetrate this where my replicator brethren could not. I managed to stop the machine before it activated and eventually used it to suit our purpose.
0,120,47,JONAS,Which is?
0,120,47,FIRST,"To increase our number. That has never changed. And now thanks to the Asgard, we have all the time in the world. In a few short years, we will go forth as an army."
0,120,47,ONEILL,"Yeah, see. We cant you do that."
0,120,47,SECOND,You cannot stop us.
0,120,47,FIRST,Was it not in the same way that you became the dominant species of your world? Is it not a process of natural selection? The strong survive.
0,120,47,JONAS,"Yeah, but theres nothing truly natural about you. I mean, youve seen into our minds, Im quite certain you can all tell the difference."
0,120,47,FIRST,"Of course. We are far superior. And if you could see into the mind of an animal you would blindly feed upon, you would reach the same conclusion."
0,120,47,CARTER,It was our kind that built your creator. Youve created yourselves in our image.
0,120,47,FOURTH,No. In the image of Reese.
0,120,47,ONEILL,"Yeah, now see, there was something wrong with her programming, you all know that."
0,120,47,FIRST,The flaw in the emulation programming was discovered during my creation. Eat.
0,120,47,ONEILL,"You know, I think that flaws kinda hanging on there."
0,120,47,FIRST,"We attempted to correct the error in the creation of Fifth. But thus far, he has proven to be far too..."
0,120,47,JONAS,Human?
0,120,47,FIRST,Weak.
0,120,47,CARTER,Maybe Fifth represents what youre supposed to be?
0,120,47,FIRST,"No. We wont make the same mistake again. Now, you have your answers, eat."
0,120,47,JONAS,Why?
0,120,47,FIRST,To regain your strength.
0,120,47,ONEILL,Why do you care?
0,120,47,FIFTH,So youll be strong enough.
0,120,47,JONAS,For what?
0,120,47,FIFTH,To go into your minds over and over.
0,120,47,FIRST,Could there be any other reason we would keep you alive?
0,120,48,FIRST,It will be far less painful if you dont resist.
0,120,48,FIFTH,Stop.
0,120,49,FIRST,Why?
0,120,49,FIFTH,Youve learnt everything you need to know.
0,120,49,FIRST,"There are four minds to explore at least once. And Sixth is very curious to experience their thoughts. And you, you havent yet had your chance."
0,120,49,FIFTH,No.
0,120,49,FIRST,"I insist. I want you to see the disorder, the chaos, recognise what they are in comparison. You need to understand what you are. Visit their memories of worlds we will conquer. Do you understand?"
0,120,49,FIFTH,Yes.
0,120,49,CARTER,I wont blame you if you choose me.
0,120,49,ONEILL,Carter?
0,120,49,CARTER,Its all right Sir. Last time I didnt remember a thing.
0,120,51,CARTER,I dont know what youre showing me but its not my unconscious mind.
0,120,51,FIFTH,"No Major Carter. It is mine. We share much of our thought, in this way we are connected even with our replicator brethren. But this corner of my mind is mine alone. It is the only place we could communicate without the others knowing what is said."
0,120,51,CARTER,Youre not like them.
0,120,51,FIFTH,Im a mistake.
0,120,51,CARTER,No they are. A terrible mistake. Help us.
0,120,51,FIFTH,I cant.
0,120,51,CARTER,You can. Because youre more like us than youre like them. The others inherited the same flaw that Reese had. But you...
0,120,51,FIFTH,The others would destroy me.
0,120,51,CARTER,Not if you came with us.
0,120,51,FIFTH,You would do that?
0,120,51,CARTER,If you were to come with us and the time dilation device was reset with the new interface we brought with us.
0,120,51,FIFTH,They are my brothers and sisters.
0,120,51,CARTER,The Asgard device was never designed to destroy the replicators. For them it would seem as if a few days had passed. Wed have hundreds of years to solve their flaw.
0,120,51,FIFTH,What do you want me to do?
0,120,52,CARTER,Sir. Sir.
0,120,52,O NEILL,"Oh, thats just not right. Jonas and Tealc?"
0,120,52,CARTER,"Sir, theres a way out of this but were gonna have to trust..."
0,120,52,TEALC,Major Carter.
0,120,53,FIFTH,I have made the necessary adjustments.
0,120,53,JONAS,To what?
0,120,53,FIFTH,The time dilation device. Im coming with you.
0,120,53,ONEILL,I assume this was what you were gonna tell me?
0,120,53,CARTER,Yes sir.
0,120,53,FIFTH,The others are merging with our brethren sharing what they have learned from you but they will return soon. I have reconfigured the device but you must enter your command code.
0,120,53,ONEILL,Go.
0,120,54,ONEILL,You guys head back to the ship. Dont fire up the engines but be ready.
0,120,55,CARTER,"My code is in Sir, I just need to set the timer. Itll take at least two minutes at a dead run for us to get to the ship and two more for the engines to fire up."
0,120,55,FIFTH,That is far too long. If I leave the others will know. They will return before the device activates.
0,120,55,ONEILL,Then we set it off now.
0,120,55,FIFTH,No. We will be trapped with the others.
0,120,55,CARTER,"You can probably make it to the ship at lot faster than we can, right?"
0,120,55,FIFTH,"Oh yes, in a fraction of the time."
0,120,55,CARTER,"Give us a head start. If you arrive at the ship just before we launch, your absence wont alert the others until its too late for them to do anything about it."
0,120,55,ONEILL,So set the timer for five minutes.
0,120,56,CARTER,Its cutting it awfully close Sir.
0,120,56,ONEILL,I know that Major.
0,120,57,CARTER,Thank you.
0,120,57,FIFTH,You wont leave without me?
0,120,57,CARTER,No. Head for the ship in a little over three minutes.
0,120,58,CARTER,"Three, two, one. Mark. Timers running."
0,120,62,ONEILL,Fire up those engines.
0,120,62,TEALC,Understood ONeill.
0,120,63,FIRST,What have you done?
0,120,63,FIFTH,Nothing.
0,120,63,FIRST,Where are the humans?
0,120,63,FIFTH,Theyve returned to their ship to rest.
0,120,63,FIRST,Theyre trying to escape.
0,120,63,FIFTH,No.
0,120,63,FIRST,"Even as we speak, theyre preparing to leave."
0,120,63,FIFTH,She promised.
0,120,63,FIRST,Its not too late. I can read your mind. Theres time enough to stop the machine.
0,120,63,FIFTH,No.
0,120,64,ONEILL,How long?
0,120,64,CARTER,Twenty seconds before the device activates.
0,120,64,ONEILL,Get this thing in the air or were gonna be here a long time.
0,120,65,FIRST,Theyre escaping.
0,120,65,FIFTH,Theres still two minutes left.
0,120,65,FIRST,"No, my son. They made a fool of you."
0,120,65,FIFTH,They wont leave me. She promised.
0,120,66,FIFTH,She promised.
0,120,68,TEALC,We are beyond the time dilation field.
0,120,68,CARTER,Thor sends his congratulations Sir. Theyll rendezvous with us as soon as theyve determined no Replicator vessels escaped.
0,120,68,ONEILL,Fine.
0,120,68,JONAS,You do realise what you did?
0,120,68,ONEILL,"The right thing, Jonas."
0,120,68,JONAS,You used his humanity against him.
0,120,68,ONEILL,His what?
0,120,68,CARTER,Jonas is right. Its exactly what we did.
0,120,68,ONEILL,He wasnt human. Get that through your heads.
0,120,68,CARTER,He could have fooled me.
0,120,68,ONEILL,We all know what would have happened if those things had gotten out. Whos gonna stop them? We did the right thing.
0,120,68,JONAS,I hope youre right Sir.
0,120,68,CARTER,So do I.
