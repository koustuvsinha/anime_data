0,122,0,REPORTER,"""The assassination of Senator Kinsey has sent shock waves through Washington. With his parties' national convention just weeks away, the Senator was considered by many to be their most likely choice for second spot on the presidential ticket. Political maneuvering..."""
0,122,1,JACK,"""Hey!"" ""I'm back. What'd I miss?"""
0,122,1,SAM,"""Sir, Senator Kinsey is dead. He was shot."""
0,122,1,JACK,"""What?"""
0,122,1,JONAS,"""Yeah, it's been all over the news for three days."""
0,122,1,JACK,"""I've been on vacation."""
0,122,1,SAM,"""It looks like it was a professional hit. The shooter took him out from a hotel room across the street and then just disappeared."""
0,122,1,JACK,"""Any suspects?"""
0,122,1,SAM,"""Police aren't saying anything."""
0,122,1,TEAL'C,"""It is reasonable to assume that a man in Senator Kinsey's position would have a great many enemies."""
0,122,2,HAMMOND,"""Colonel?"""
0,122,2,JACK,"""General..."""
0,122,2,HAMMOND,"""I'm sorry to have to this but these men are here to escort you to Peterson. From there you'll be flown to Andrews and then turned over to the civilian authorities in Washington."""
0,122,2,SAM,"""Sir, what is this?"""
0,122,2,HAMMOND,"""Colonel O'Neill is under arrest for the murder of Senator Kinsey."""
0,122,2,JACK,"""What?"""
0,122,2,SF1,"""You'll have to come with us, sir."""
0,122,2,JACK,
0,122,2,HAMMOND,"""Colonel..."""
0,122,2,JACK,"""General, I've been on vacation."""
0,122,2,HAMMOND,
0,122,2,SAM,"""There's no way Colonel O'Neill could have done this."""
0,122,2,HAMMOND,"""I'm aware of that, Major, but my hands are tied."""
0,122,2,JONAS,"""How could they possibly think that he's responsible? He wasn't even in Washington."""
0,122,2,DAVIS,"""Actually...it looks like he was."""
0,122,2,HAMMOND,"""Major Davis is acting as liaison between the Pentagon and the District Attorney. He has a report for us. Major?"""
0,122,3,DAVIS,"""Thank you, sir. This was taken from a security camera in a hotel across the street from where the shooting occurred, just a couple of minutes after it happened."" ""Now, the trajectory of the bullet indicates that the shot did, in fact, come from this hotel."""
0,122,3,JONAS,"""That doesn't prove anything."""
0,122,3,DAVIS,"""No, but based on this evidence, the FBI attained search warrants to search both the Colonel's house and his cabin. They didn't find anything but one of the neighbors told them that they saw Colonel O'Neill dumping something down by the lake. They sent down a diver who...came up with this."" ""Ballistics match it with the bullet that killed Senator Kinsey. Well, I don't know what else to say, sir. It's certainly no secret that there was bad blood between them."""
0,122,3,SAM,"""Oh, come on...they had a few run-ins. That's hardly a motive for murder."""
0,122,3,JONAS,"""Okay, I've read the file on Kinsey, but it is a little vague."""
0,122,3,HAMMOND,"""The Senator was involved with a group of individuals who were unhappy with the way Stargate Command was being run."""
0,122,3,SAM,"""They tried to blackmail General Hammond into resigning. Colonel O'Neill found evidence connecting Kinsey to their illegal activities and threatened to go public with it unless he got them to back off."""
0,122,3,JONAS,"""So, technically, Kinsey was protecting the SGC."""
0,122,3,SAM,"""True, but I don't think he was very happy about it."""
0,122,3,JONAS,"""Still, that's not a motive to kill the guy, that's a motive to keep him alive."""
0,122,3,TEAL'C,"""Unfortunately, we can divulge none of this information to the civilian authorities."""
0,122,3,HAMMOND,"""Senator Kinsey was shot in broad daylight on a public street in front of a dozen civilian witnesses. If we tried to shift this it a military court, it would be a political disaster for the current administration."""
0,122,3,SAM,"""With all due respect, sir, the current administration owes a lot to the Colonel."""
0,122,3,HAMMOND,"""I'm aware of that, Major, as is the President. Unfortunately, there's nothing he can do for Colonel O'Neill at this time. On the other hand, I'm not a politician. Which is why I'm suspending SG-1's off-world duties and assigning the three of you to get to the bottom of this. You have the full resources of this command at your disposal."""
0,122,3,SAM,"""Thank you, sir."""
0,122,3,HAMMOND,"""Dismissed."" Hammond and SG-1 leave the briefing room. Davis remains at the table, looking at the image of Jack on the presentation screen."
0,122,3,JONAS,"""Colonel...how are you...doing?"""
0,122,3,JACK,"""I'm accused of a murder I didn't commit. How do you think I'm doing?"""
0,122,3,JONAS,"""When are you supposed to get transferred to Washington?"""
0,122,3,JACK,"""Couple of days."""
0,122,3,TEAL'C,"""General Hammond has suspended our off-world duties in order that we may investigate this situation further."""
0,122,3,JONAS,"""Unfortunately, it's not going very well."""
0,122,3,TEAL'C,"""There is evidence that places you at the scene of the shooting."""
0,122,3,JACK,
0,122,3,JONAS,"""They...somehow...have a video that clearly places you in Washington D. C. three days ago."""
0,122,3,JACK,
0,122,3,JONAS,"""We know you've been on secret missions before. We're not always privy to the details..."""
0,122,3,JACK,
0,122,3,TEAL'C,"""Did you encounter anyone that can verify your story?"""
0,122,3,JACK,
0,122,3,TEAL'C,"""Perhaps this is all part of an elaborate plan...and those responsible chose to act at a time when they knew you would have no alibi."""
0,122,3,SAM,
0,122,3,JONAS,"""So, either that is Colonel O'Neill or someone who happens to look exactly like him."""
0,122,3,TEAL'C,"""We have encountered duplicating technology before."""
0,122,3,SAM,
0,122,3,JONAS,"""Mimic devices? Someone want to fill me in?"""
0,122,4,HAMMOND,"""Three years ago we had a foothold situation here at the SGC. Aliens gained control by using mimic devices to impersonate and replace base personnel, including myself."""
0,122,4,JONAS,"""Why haven't I heard about this before?"""
0,122,4,HAMMOND,"""Because of the seriousness of the security breach, a decision was made to erase all mention of the incident from official records."""
0,122,4,JONAS,"""Well, where are these devices now?"""
0,122,4,SAM,"""Area 51."""
0,122,4,SAM,"""How many do you have?"""
0,122,4,SCIENTIST,"""We recovered 12 from the SGC."" ""They're all stored here."""
0,122,4,SAM,"""Has anyone been studying them recently?"""
0,122,4,SCIENTIST,"""We've all be focusing on the X-303."" . ""There we go. All present and accounted for."""
0,122,5,SAM,"""It's a fake. All the mimic devices were switched."""
0,122,5,JACK,"""Someone duplicated the duplicators?"""
0,122,5,SAM,"""The last reported test of those devices was six months ago. It could have been taken any time after that."""
0,122,5,JONAS,"""There has got to be some way that we can use this to clear you."""
0,122,5,JACK,
0,122,5,JONAS,"""If I'm understanding this correctly, there is someone walking around out there that can make himself look exactly like you at the push of a button. That's gotta be relevant."""
0,122,5,SAM,"""It's classified information, Jonas."" ""But, we can use it to find the real assassin...maybe."""
0,122,6,JONAS,"""So, how do these things work?"""
0,122,6,SAM,"""Well, it's a two part process. First you take somebody and pass them through a large scanning device which then uploads their exact image into a holographic sequencer."""
0,122,6,JONAS,"""Which...looks like this."""
0,122,6,SAM,"""Exactly. Then you place that sequencer somewhere on your body and activate it, and you instantly take on the appearance of the person you scanned."""
0,122,6,TEAL'C,"""Was the scanning device taken?"""
0,122,6,SAM,"""No. It's still at Area 51. We checked it out."""
0,122,6,JONAS,"""So, whoever did this can only impersonate a limited number of people?"""
0,122,6,SAM,"""12 to be precise, including Colonel O'Neill, Dr. Fraiser and Daniel."""
0,122,6,JONAS,"""What about General Hammond?"""
0,122,6,SAM,"""The alien impersonating him was trapped in the 'gate room along with several others. They activated some kind of self-destruct and blew themselves up. In case you're wondering, Teal'c and I were never scanned."""
0,122,6,JONAS,"""That's good to know."""
0,122,6,SAM,"""I've requested all the personnel files on everyone who had access to these devices. I'd like the two of you to check them out. """
0,122,6,JONAS,"""What about you?"""
0,122,6,SAM,"""I'm going to Washington. I need to look up an old acquaintance."""
0,122,6,SAM,"""Major Carter...I'm here to see Agent Barrett."""
0,122,7,BARRETT,"""Major Carter, I was wondering how long it would be before you came by. Welcome to NID Headquarters."""
0,122,7,JONAS,"""In three years, only 8 people at Area 51 have had authorized access to the mimic devices."""
0,122,7,TEAL'C,"""We must speak to them all."""
0,122,7,JONAS,"""Most of them have been transferred to the X-303 project, so they're still living in Nevada. Wait a minute...there's something..."" ""Dr. Brent Langham."""
0,122,7,TEAL'C,"""Deceased."""
0,122,7,JONAS,"""Killed in an automobile accident three weeks ago."""
0,122,7,TEAL'C,"""Given the circumstance, that would appear to be a highly unlikely coincidence."""
0,122,7,BARRETT,"""What exactly are you implying here, Major? That the NID had a hand in the assassination of a U. S. Senator?"""
0,122,7,SAM,"""Very few organizations have the resources to pull off something like this."""
0,122,7,BARRETT,"""And the man accused of the crime happens to belong to one of them."""
0,122,7,SAM,"""The SGC is not behind this."""
0,122,7,BARRETT,"""Senator Kinsey was no friend of the Stargate Command. In fact, he tried to take you down more than once."""
0,122,7,SAM,"""We don't engage in criminal activity, Agent Barrett. Which is more than I can say for the NID."""
0,122,7,BARRETT,"""If you're referring to the Prometheus incident, that was orchestrated by a handful of rogue agents."""
0,122,7,SAM,"""What about Steveston, Oregon? You sat by and watched while the Goa'uld took over an entire town of innocent civilians."""
0,122,7,BARRETT,"""That was an officially sanctioned operation, that would have succeeded if it wasn't for your interference."""
0,122,7,SAM,"""Are you kidding me? You're agents were compromised and your organization was about to be infiltrated."""
0,122,7,BARRETT,"""Look Major,"" ""the video tape of Colonel O'Neill clearly places him at the scene of the crime. And the murder weapon was found near his cabin. So..."" ""If you'll excuse me..."" ""I've got work to do."""
0,122,8,BARRETT,"""You know, it says here that by 2075 the Earth's oceans will be to warm to sustain most coral reefs. And once they're gone, the entire ecosystem of the planet will collapse."""
0,122,8,SAM,"""That's a cheerful thought."""
0,122,8,BARRETT,"""We spend all of our time trying to protect the world from the Goa'uld, maybe we should worry a little more about protecting it from ourselves."""
0,122,8,SAM,"""What are we doing out here, Agent Barrett?"""
0,122,8,BARRETT,"""My office is bugged. It's standard procedure to record all conversations that take place at NID Headquarters. What I'm about to tell you, Major, nobody else can know, especially my superiors."""
0,122,8,SAM,"""What're you talking about?"
0,122,8,BARRETT,"""There's a cancer at the NID, a shadow organization that operates outside the law. It's time they were exposed for who they really are."""
0,122,8,SAM,
0,122,8,BARRETT,"""The Prometheus incident - that was the last straw. After that, I was called to the White House for an assignment."""
0,122,8,SAM,"""What does this have to do with Colonel O'Neill?"""
0,122,8,BARRETT,"""Senator Kinsey was working for me. He was about to give me enough evidence to bring down the entire leadership of the shadow group."""
0,122,8,SAM,"""How did you convince him to do that?"""
0,122,8,BARRETT,"""Let's just say I know about a few of the skeletons in the Senator's closet. And, it is an election year."""
0,122,8,SAM,"""You blackmailed him."""
0,122,8,BARRETT,"""I'll do whatever it takes to bring these people down, Major."""
0,122,8,TIME JUMP FORWARD,Sam and Barrett are walking in the park.
0,122,8,SAM,"""So, who else knows about this?"""
0,122,8,BARRETT,"""As of this moment, the President, a few members of his staff and you."""
0,122,8,SAM,"""You're working alone?"""
0,122,8,BARRETT,"""The smaller the operation, the less chance of it being compromised. You have no idea how far the corruption goes, Major. Not even the SGC is immune."""
0,122,8,SAM,"""Then you're taking a big risk talking to me."""
0,122,8,BARRETT,
0,122,8,SAM,"""When you work with someone that long, you just know."""
0,122,8,BARRETT,"""No, there's something more than that. There's something you're not telling me."""
0,122,8,SAM,"""You're job requires you to be suspicious of everybody, even your co-workers. Where I come from, we trust each other with our lives every day. Maybe that's something you can't understand."""
0,122,8,BARRETT,"""Well, I guess it's never to late to learn."""
0,122,8,JONAS,"""When the mimic devices were first brought to Area 51 a team of eight scientists was assigned to study them. The Pentagon was hoping to be able to adapt the devices for use in the field. However, while the original holographic images that were created by the aliens seemed to last indefinitely, those that were created by the scientist in the lab were only sustainable for three to four minutes at a time due to problems with electromagnetic interference. So, the project was scaled back and five of the original team members were reassigned. The remaining three were Dr. Singh, Dr. Healey, and this fellow..."" ""...Dr. Brent Langham. They continued working on the devices for another six months with no new breakthroughs. Finally, the entire project was shut down and, uh, Dr. Healey and Dr. Singh were transferred to the X-303 project."""
0,122,8,HAMMOND,"""And Dr. Langham?"""
0,122,8,JONAS,"""He was supposedly killed in car crash two days before the transfer was due to take effect."""
0,122,8,JANET,"""The body was burned beyond recognition. He was identified through dental records, but the coroner missed something. The toxicology report came back clean, no signs of any drugs or alcohol in the victim's blood."""
0,122,8,HAMMOND,"""Why is that unusual?"""
0,122,8,JANET,"""Well, Dr. Langham was epileptic. His condition required him to take regular dosed of anti-convulsant drugs. There should have been traces of those drugs in his blood."""
0,122,8,TEAL'C,"""The dental records were falsified. The body recovered at the crash site was someone else."""
0,122,8,HAMMOND,"""So, you're saying this Dr. Langham took the mimic device and engineered his own disappearance?"""
0,122,8,JONAS,"""Or someone engineered it for him."""
0,122,8,JANET,"""Okay, are we suggesting then that this scientist shot Kinsey?"""
0,122,8,JONAS,
0,122,8,TEAL'C,"""Perhaps Dr. Langham merely provided the mimic devices for a fee."""
0,122,8,JANET,"""But he can lead us to whoever was responsible."""
0,122,8,HAMMOND,
0,122,8,JONAS,"""Yes, sir."""
0,122,9,SAM,"""Okay...what is this?"""
0,122,9,BARRETT,"""The rifle used to kill Senator Kinsey was not the kind of thing you could pick up at your local sporting goods store. This is a one-stop shop for unregistered weapons. High-end merchandise, professional clientele. There's a good chance our shooter was here."""
0,122,9,SAM,"""If you know they're selling illegal guns, why don't you shut them down?"""
0,122,9,BARRETT,
0,122,9,SAM,"""Leo..."" They continue into the warehouse. It is a large concrete room filled with weapons and gear. They walk to a desk and sit in chairs facing the desk. There is a man dressed in designer duds behind the desk, also sitting. There are also several body guard present."

0,122,9,MAN,"""Yeah? I moved one last week."""
0,122,9,SAM,"""Well, in all likelihood, the weapon you sold was used to assassinate a United States Senator."""
0,122,9,MAN,"""What's your point?"""
0,122,9,BARRETT,"""Was the buyer a regular customer?"""
0,122,9,MAN,"""No, I'd never seen him before."""

0,122,9,SAM,"""There's one full set of prints and one partial on the second rifle, but neither of them match Colonel O'Neill."""
0,122,9,BARRETT,"""It's a little strange."""
0,122,9,SAM,"""Well, assuming that full set matches our friend Leo, that would mean that the partial belongs to the shooter."""
0,122,9,BARRETT,"""Maybe."""
0,122,9,SAM,"""It's the best lead we have."""
0,122,9,BARRETT,"""The shooter probably won't have a criminal record. In fact, there's a good chance he may not exist on any database at all."""
0,122,9,SAM,"""Except maybe NID personnel files. You said it yourself, Agent Barrett. There's a cancer in your organization. Kinsey was going to bring them down, so they had him killed. So, did they hire an outside contractor...or use one of their own?"""

0,122,10,JANET,"""Yes, but there's a wide range of treatments that vary from case to case. See, Dr. Langham was on a very specific combination of drugs, including primidone and carbamazepine. So, we can access the national pharmaceutical database and focus on new prescriptions written in the past three weeks. We then cross reference that with age and gender and we should be able to narrow down the field."""

0,122,18,JONAS,"""So, they're selling alien technology?"""
0,122,18,LANGHAM,"""No, they're buying it. The members of the Committee aren't spies or secret agents. They're businessmen. The rogue NID agents work for them.

0,122,22,SAM,"""We encountered the devices three years ago during a foothold situation. It was a close one. Kinsey was trying to shut down the Stargate program for being too risky, so the whole thing was covered up by Presidential order."""

Of course, taking a bullet was not part of my original plan to bring these men down, but the success of the operation was well worth...any personal sacrifice on my part. And I want the American people to know that, if elected, I intend to bring that same determination and zeal for justice with me to the White House. I would also like to than Colonel Jack O'Neill of the United States Air Force for the vital role he played in my investigation. I can't go into details for reasons of national security, but I can assure you all that any evidence pointing to the Colonel as my would-be assassin...was simply part of the operation.""
