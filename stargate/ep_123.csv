0,123,0,"""PARADISE LOST""",By Robert C. Cooper
0,123,1,JONAS,Did he say how he came across this key?
0,123,1,ONEILL,No.
0,123,1,HAMMOND,You were correct when you said its doubtful the Pentagon would authorise Colonel Maybournes presence on an offworld mission.
0,123,1,TEALC,Should we not at least explore the planet to which he has provided the address?
0,123,1,ONEILL,He did risk his butt just to make the proposition.
0,123,1,CARTER,"Maybe we can get through the door without him? If Maybourne thinks its worth a pardon, whats on the other side; it must be good."
0,123,1,HAMMOND,Do it.
0,123,3,JONAS,Nobody home.
0,123,4,TEALC,"Are you able to translate any of this, Jonas Quinn?"
0,123,4,JONAS,Its not Ancient but its definitely a language belonging to one of the races of the ancient alliance.
0,123,4,ONEILL,Nox? Asgard?
0,123,4,JONAS,Furlings.
0,123,4,ONEILL,"Oh no, not those guys."
0,123,4,JONAS,What?
0,123,4,ONEILL,"Oh I dont know, I just cant imagine cute little furry things making big powerful weapons, thats all."
0,123,4,JONAS,I dont even know what they look like.
0,123,4,ONEILL,Furling. Sounds cute and fuzzy to me.
0,123,4,JONAS,This section says something like only the righteous may pass.
0,123,4,CARTER,This looks like where Maybournes key would go. Im getting energy readings. Theres a power source in this arch. Here.
0,123,5,CARTER,Sir? This is definitely something.
0,123,5,ONEILL,What?
0,123,5,CARTER,I dont know. I dont recognise the technology.
0,123,5,ONEILL,But can you make it work?
0,123,6,ONEILL,"Well General, Maybournes story checks out so far. Theres a doorway there that Carter thinks may be a transporter but she cant get it to work without Maybournes key."
0,123,6,HAMMOND,What do you recommend Colonel?
0,123,7,MAYBOURNE,Jack.
0,123,7,ONEILL,Harry.
0,123,7,MAYBOURNE,Im trusting you.
0,123,7,ONEILL,Turned yourself in. What happens from hereon out is up to you.
0,123,8,HAMMOND,You can remove the cuffs Airman.
0,123,8,MAYBOURNE,"General, nice to see you again."
0,123,8,HAMMOND,Despite your prior transgressions youve shown a willingness to help us out of some serious situations recently. And that is why the President is willing to proceed in this matter.
0,123,8,MAYBOURNE,Youre welcome.
0,123,8,ONEILL,Lets see what you brought.
0,123,9,MAYBOURNE,When do we leave?
0,123,9,ONEILL,I leave right now. Well let you know how it turns out.
0,123,9,MAYBOURNE,Jack. I thought I was pretty clear. I go with you or no deal.
0,123,9,ONEILL,"Harry, youre under arrest, Ive got the stone and Im walking out that door. Youre not in a strong bargaining position."
0,123,9,MAYBOURNE,The only way this mission will be successful is if Im on it. That stone is useless without the combination.
0,123,9,ONEILL,Hows that?
0,123,9,MAYBOURNE,It was originally found over 80 years ago in a Pharaohs tomb in Egypt. The stone was wrapped in a scroll with writing on it that no Earth linguist could decipher. I was recently able to get it translated though.
0,123,9,ONEILL,By whom?
0,123,9,MAYBOURNE,The scroll contained instructions for how to use the stone to access the power of the Gods. That information exists in one place. Right here. A deals a deal. You want t o go through that door? Im gonna be the one who opens it.
0,123,9,HAMMOND,Theres got to be something more going on here than hell admit to.
0,123,9,ONEILL,"Of that I have no doubt, Sir. But if hes not willing to tell us, we cant force him. Much as I like to try."
0,123,10,MAYBOURNE,Now this is more like it.
0,123,10,ONEILL,Shall we?
0,123,11,ONEILL,Yes?
0,123,11,MAYBOURNE,You know the real reason I wanna do this? Ive never actually been through this thing before.
0,123,11,ONEILL,Really?
0,123,11,MAYBOURNE,I ran the off world operation from Earth using a Goauld communicator.
0,123,11,ONEILL,Nervous?
0,123,11,MAYBOURNE,Me? Nah. Im just taking a moment.
0,123,11,ONEILL,Done?
0,123,11,MAYBOURNE,Yeah.
0,123,14,ONEILL,Carter.
0,123,14,CARTER,Colonels.
0,123,14,MAYBOURNE,Major.
0,123,14,ONEILL,Jonas?
0,123,14,CARTER,He finished cataloguing the writing and went to do a wider sweep of the surrounding area with Tealc.
0,123,14,MAYBOURNE,He translated everything?
0,123,14,CARTER,No. He still needs to get some reference from the SGC. Says itll take a while.
0,123,14,ONEILL,Harry?
0,123,16,ONEILL,What?
0,123,16,MAYBOURNE,Im sure Ive done it right.
0,123,16,ONEILL,Harry?
0,123,16,MAYBOURNE,It shouldve worked.
0,123,17,CARTER,Let me take a look.
0,123,18,ONEILL,Harry!
0,123,20,ONEILL,"You rotten, no good for nothing..."
0,123,20,MAYBOURNE,Jack?
0,123,20,ONEILL,You son of a...
0,123,20,JACK!,
0,123,22,JONAS,Major Carter? What happened?
0,123,22,ONEILL,Where the hell are we?
0,123,22,MAYBOURNE,"Dammit Jack, whyd you have to do that?"
0,123,22,ONEILL,Wheres the zat?
0,123,22,MAYBOURNE,"I dont know, I dont have it."
0,123,23,ONEILL,Where is it?
0,123,23,MAYBOURNE,Its not here. I guess it didnt come through with us.
0,123,23,ONEILL,Why not?
0,123,23,MAYBOURNE,"Well, how should I know? Maybe the doorway filters out weapons?"
0,123,24,MAYBOURNE,Goauld weapons?
0,123,24,ONEILL,Now you listen to me. I want a straight answer from you.
0,123,24,MAYBOURNE,"Well since youre here, I might as well just show you."
0,123,24,ONEILL,Hey!
0,123,24,MAYBOURNE,Come on!
0,123,25,CARTER,"Im getting nowhere here. Jonas, head back to the SGC, ask General Hammond to set up a UAV. If Colonel ONeill has activated his tracking device, we should be able to pinpoint his location."
0,123,25,MAYBOURNE,You couldnt just let me go.
0,123,25,ONEILL,You shot me!
0,123,25,MAYBOURNE,"Zatted. Im not going back, you know."
0,123,25,ONEILL,Where?
0,123,25,MAYBOURNE,Anywhere. To the Stargate or Earth.
0,123,25,ONEILL,What are you talking about?
0,123,25,MAYBOURNE,"I dont know, maybe theyve got a way to send you back. I dont think anyones supposed to leave, thats part of the deal."
0,123,25,ONEILL,Who are you talking about? What deal?
0,123,25,MAYBOURNE,The people at the place were going.
0,123,25,ONEILL,"Maybourne, have you completely lost your mind because if youre suffering Ill gladly put you out of your misery."
0,123,25,MAYBOURNE,Its an alien utopia. According to the scroll its supposed to be paradise.
0,123,25,ONEILL,What?
0,123,25,MAYBOURNE,"A long time ago, some people from an advanced alien society, well they chucked it all and formed this small, isolated utopian community. They sent out representatives to meet and evaluate people from all over the galaxy and offer them a chance to join them. The scroll and the stone were the invitation."
0,123,25,ONEILL,And this has nothing to do with the weapons Simmons was after?
0,123,25,MAYBOURNE,I just figured it was my only way of getting through the Gate.
0,123,25,ONEILL,"You know Harry, its not that I cant believe you lied to me again, its that you lied to me again!"
0,123,25,MAYBOURNE,"Oh come on Jack, no one would have let me through the Gate for this. Would you have even believed me?"
0,123,25,ONEILL,And youre sure this is all worth it?
0,123,25,MAYBOURNE,"Couldnt be much worse than where Ive been forced to hide out... lately. Theyre closing in on me, its only a matter of time. Besides, Ive got nothing left on Earth anymore. The money I was supposed to get from selling the Russian symbiote to Adrian Conrad was my last shot at making a life on Earth. Do something good and it turned into a disaster."
0,123,25,ONEILL,Of massive proportion.
0,123,25,MAYBOURNE,"Im tired of running Jack, why should I, when I could have a chance of retiring in paradise?"
0,123,25,ONEILL,"I see trees, Harry. You get that in Colorado."
0,123,26,SILER,"Ready for launch, Sir."
0,123,26,HAMMOND,"Thank you, sergeant."
0,123,27,CARTER,"Still nothing from Colonel ONeill and Colonel Maybourne, sir. Theyve been gone over two hours now."
0,123,27,HAMMOND,Were ready to go.
0,123,27,CARTER,"Sir, Id like to apologise."
0,123,27,HAMMOND,What for?
0,123,27,CARTER,"This is my fault, I allowed Colonel Maybourne to take my weapon."
0,123,27,HAMMOND,"Major, lets just focus on finding them right now."
0,123,27,CARTER,Yes sir.
0,123,27,ONEILL,You are so lost.
0,123,27,MAYBOURNE,"No, Im sure this is the right way."
0,123,27,ONEILL,Hows that?
0,123,27,MAYBOURNE,"Its in this valley. Its strange, theres supposed to be a greeting party."
0,123,27,ONEILL,"And you know, thats all thats strange about this."
0,123,27,MAYBOURNE,Theyre supposed to know when someone uses the doorway. I was expecting some sort of welcome.
0,123,27,ONEILL,Leis?
0,123,27,MAYBOURNE,Well something.
0,123,27,ONEILL,"Cabana boys? I tell you Maybourne, I dont hear any steel drummmms. How old was that invitation?"
0,123,28,MAYBOURNE,Theres no one here.
0,123,28,ONEILL,I noticed that.
0,123,29,ONEILL,Harry?
0,123,30,ONEILL,This in the brochure?
0,123,30,LEE,"Major, this technologys unlike anything weve come across before."
0,123,30,CARTER,I know.
0,123,30,LEE,"We have no frame of reference, no way to interface."
0,123,30,CARTER,"Im working on it, Doctor. As you should be!"
0,123,30,LEE,Right.
0,123,32,ONEILL,I guess I can see why youd want to retire here. Given your choices.
0,123,32,MAYBOURNE,Find anything that might be a doorway back?
0,123,32,ONEILL,No.
0,123,32,MAYBOURNE,You gonna kill me?
0,123,32,ONEILL,Ill sleep on it.
0,123,35,ONEILL,Well I dont think were walking out of here.
0,123,35,MAYBOURNE,No way of knowing how far we were transported. We could be on the other side of the planet.
0,123,35,ONEILL,Which is why we survive here until were rescued.
0,123,35,MAYBOURNE,"Until were rescued. Jack, this place is supposed to be a secret. The doorway was designed to keep it that way."
0,123,35,ONEILL,"Of course, we have the only key known to man."
0,123,35,MAYBOURNE,The least you could have done was eat that before you got here.
0,123,36,ONEILL,Were gonna need food and drinkable water.
0,123,36,MAYBOURNE,Ive been drinking the lake straight up.
0,123,36,ONEILL,Well thats smart.
0,123,36,MAYBOURNE,Im not dead yet.
0,123,36,ONEILL,Its early.
0,123,36,MAYBOURNE,"Jack, theyre never gonna find us."
0,123,37,CARTER,I covered as much territory as the range of the UAV will allow.
0,123,37,TEALC,Have you received word from the Tokra?
0,123,37,CARTER,"Yeah, they responded and said they didnt know when one of their operatives with access to a ship would be able to help us.. what are they doing?"
0,123,37,TEALC,I believe they have completed their analyses.
0,123,37,CARTER,"Excuse me? Wheres Colonel ONeill? I dont see him, do you? Did you guys find him while I was gone?"
0,123,37,LEE,"Weve been here for a week and Im not sure, but Im pretty certain we could all spend the rest of our natural lives trying to figure out exactly how this thing works. Do you know what? Even if I could snap my fingers and turn it on right now, Im beginning to doubt whether it would determine where it sent Colonel ONeill. Id bet almost anything that the targeting data is in the artefact that Colonel Maybourne used to open that doorway."
0,123,37,CARTER,I say when were done here.
0,123,37,LEE,"With all due respect Major, I will submit my report to General Hammond. If hes prepared to commit to a long term analysis project, Im happy to come back, with my big suitcase. But until then, if youll excuse me?"
0,123,38,MAYBOURNE,Anything?
0,123,38,ONEILL,"Couple of nibbles. Theyre down there, though."
0,123,38,MAYBOURNE,Sleep okay?
0,123,38,ONEILL,No. You?
0,123,38,MAYBOURNE,"When we first came here, I thought it was quiet. Now its like I cant keep the noise out. Insects, animals, I dont know, I keep hearing things."
0,123,38,ONEILL,Theyre called birds.
0,123,38,MAYBOURNE,"No, no these are weird sounds."
0,123,38,ONEILL,Were on an alien planet.
0,123,38,MAYBOURNE,"Yeah, Jack I cant live on this stuff, it tastes like arrugala. I hate arrugala."
0,123,38,ONEILL,Dont eat it.
0,123,38,MAYBOURNE,We have to eat.
0,123,38,ONEILL,"You know, if you keep standing there yakking away, Im not gonna catch anything."
0,123,39,ONEILL,What was that?
0,123,41,ONEILL,That is just wrong on so many levels.
0,123,42,ONEILL,Dont ever do that again.
0,123,42,MAYBOURNE,Youre saying you dont hear things?
0,123,42,ONEILL,No.
0,123,42,MAYBOURNE,"Last night, I swear I heard someone running around out here. Spent an hour wandering around trying to spot him."
0,123,42,ONEILL,Animals.
0,123,42,MAYBOURNE,No tracks.
0,123,42,ONEILL,Youre losing your mind.
0,123,42,MAYBOURNE,You dont find things a little spooky around here?
0,123,42,ONEILL,Made so only by your presence.
0,123,42,MAYBOURNE,"yeah well, Im beginning to wonder if some of the Utopians might still be alive."
0,123,42,ONEILL,Theres no evidence of that.
0,123,42,MAYBOURNE,Well maybe theyre here in another way.
0,123,42,ONEILL,"Al right, now you are getting spooky."
0,123,42,MAYBOURNE,"Oh come on Jack, youve seen stranger things. Other dimensions, planes of existence. You said it your self, this is an alien planet."
0,123,42,ONEILL,So what do you want me to do?
0,123,42,MAYBOURNE,Give me your 9ml.
0,123,42,ONEILL,No.
0,123,42,MAYBOURNE,"Oh come on, youve got the P90. You sleep with it beside you for Gods sake; I just want to be able to protect myself."
0,123,42,ONEILL,Forget it.
0,123,42,MAYBOURNE,Jack! I want that gun.
0,123,42,ONEILL,"Forget it! You dont like it here, deal with it. Its your own damn fault."
0,123,42,MAYBOURNE,You wouldnt care if I died would you?
0,123,42,ONEILL,What are you talking about?
0,123,42,MAYBOURNE,"Some alien creature comes in and attacks me in the middle of the night, hauls me out while youre sleeping."
0,123,42,ONEILL,"You and I are the only ones here. Trust me, the only thing you have to be afraid of around here is me."
0,123,42,MAYBOURNE,Yeah.
0,123,45,CARTER,"Sir, a satellite capable of pinpointing Colonel ONeills tracking device would be able to cover a much greater range. The Tokra could retrieve it later by ship when one became available so the actual cost would be minimal."
0,123,45,HAMMOND,Compared to what?
0,123,45,CARTER,To not getting the satellite back.
0,123,45,HAMMOND,"What about the cost of the delivery system, never mind the manpower required to get it through the Gate and then reassemble it on the other side?"
0,123,45,CARTER,"Sir, I dont think you can place a value on Colonel ONeills life."
0,123,45,HAMMOND,"Of course not, but..."
0,123,45,DAVIS,Unscheduled offworld activation.
0,123,45,HAMMOND,Well continue this later.
0,123,46,DAVIS,"Were receiving a transmission, audio only."
0,123,46,JOLEN,This is Jolen of the Tokra. To whom am I speaking?
0,123,46,HAMMOND,"General Hammond. Major Carter, Tealc and Jonas Quinn are also here."
0,123,46,JOLEN,Major I just received your message regarding the disappearance of Colonel ONeill.
0,123,46,CARTER,Do you have a ship capable of scanning the planet?
0,123,46,JOLEN,Yes. In fact Ive already taken the opportunity to fly over the planet in question. There were no detectable human life signs.
0,123,46,CARTER,Are you sure?
0,123,46,JOLEN,Quite sure. I am very sorry.
0,123,46,HAMMOND,Thank you. Hammond out.
0,123,46,JOLEN,Jolen out.
0,123,48,ONEILL,Maybourne!
0,123,50,TEALC,Major Carter.
0,123,50,CARTER,"Tealc, this is the womens locker room."
0,123,50,TEALC,It appears there is no one else here but you and you are fully clothed.
0,123,50,CARTER,True.
0,123,51,TEALC,Are you alright Major Carter?
0,123,51,CARTER,"Im fine, yeah."
0,123,51,TEALC,Have you given up hope of finding ONeill?
0,123,51,CARTER,"Hope? No. Im starting to think Dr Lee is right. I dont think the doorway is the answer. Its been almost a month Tealc, if there were a way back. Just, it feels like we just lost Daniel, and I dont know if I can..."
0,123,53,ONEILL,Arrghhh! Argghh!
0,123,54,MAYBOURNE,Arrgghhh!
0,123,55,MAYBOURNE,You shot me!
0,123,55,ONEILL,I didnt know you were there.
0,123,55,MAYBOURNE,Stay back!
0,123,56,ONEILL,Put that down.
0,123,56,MAYBOURNE,You wanted to kill me from the start.
0,123,56,ONEILL,Oh screw you Maybourne! I was joking. Look what you did to my leg!
0,123,56,MAYBOURNE,I set the trap for the pig.
0,123,56,ONEILL,With a grenade?
0,123,57,ONEILL,"Where are you going? Harry? I found something. Stop eating that plant. Its messing with your head Harry. Ah, screw you."
0,123,59,JONAS,General Hammond says hes considering new SG1 leaders. You included Major.
0,123,59,CARTER,We know. Do you have anything?
0,123,59,JONAS,"Yeah, yeah, I was finally able to come up with some photos of that artefact Maybourne got his hands on. Its quite old making the scroll a bit difficult to read and Im pretty sure the markings on the stone are just decoration but..."
0,123,59,CARTER,"Tealc, wind back that tape."
0,123,60,CARTER,"Stop, there."
0,123,60,JONAS,That was the first day we were there.
0,123,60,CARTER,I dont believe it. It wasnt visible after that; I forgot it was even there.
0,123,60,JONAS,What?
0,123,60,CARTER,"The moon. The doorway device doesnt use wormhole technology, it wasnt designed to send you across the galaxy. We thought theyd been sent somewhere else on the planet but they havent, theyve been sent to that moon."
0,123,60,JONAS,How do you know that?
0,123,60,CARTER,"The big circle is the planet, the little circle is the moon, the line between them is the path of transportation."
0,123,61,ONEILL,"Harry? Harry? It was a Goauld. It couldnt bring a weapon through that door so it brought a plant. Its some kind of drug or something. Maybe it was an experiment, maybe it was supposed to get the people to serve him, I dont know but it backfired. These people, they all killed each other because of that plant. Youre paranoid, its messing with your head. Im not trying to kill you."
0,123,62,ONEILL,Drop it. Drop it now or I will shoot you.
0,123,64,ONEILL,"Im not trying to kill you Harry. Youre losing a lot of blood. If I dont do something right now, youre gonna die."
0,123,65,MAYBOURNE,Some retirement this turned out to be.
0,123,65,ONEILL,How are you doing?
0,123,65,MAYBOURNE,My heads a bit clearer. How long have I been out?
0,123,65,ONEILL,"I dont know, day or so."
0,123,65,MAYBOURNE,I really screwed up didnt I?
0,123,65,ONEILL,Its not your fault. None of the people here could stop themselves.
0,123,65,MAYBOURNE,"Right from the beginning. Sorry Jack, I never should have dragged you into this."
0,123,65,ONEILL,"Yes Harry, youve been a very bad boy."
0,123,66,ONEILL,"Hey, dont you die on me now."
0,123,66,MAYBOURNE,What difference would it make?
0,123,67,ONEILL,Because were about to be rescued.
0,123,67,MAYBOURNE,Oh thats nice.
0,123,67,ONEILL,Isnt it?
0,123,67,MAYBOURNE,I cant go back. Id rather die here than spend the rest of my life in jail.
0,123,67,ONEILL,"Yeah, um, Ive been giving that some thought. I think you suffered enough. Hell I even got to shoot you."
0,123,67,MAYBOURNE,Twice.
0,123,67,ONEILL,I think the Tokra should be able to find a nice planet for you.
0,123,67,MAYBOURNE,Thanks Jack.
0,123,67,ONEILL,"Sure, Harry, sure."
