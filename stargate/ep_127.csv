0,127,2,DOCTOR,Let us proceed.
0,127,4,APOPHIS,Scalpel.
0,127,6,JONAS,You all right?
0,127,6,TEAL'C,What?
0,127,6,JONAS,Another nightmare?
0,127,6,TEAL'C,Yeah.
0,127,6,JONAS,What about?
0,127,6,TEAL'C,Nothin'!
0,127,7,TEAL'C,"Look, I'm fine. Go on back to sleep, Probie, you got"
0,127,8,JONAS,"Hey, you know, if I was doing what you're doing for my"
0,127,9,TEAL'C,I'm fine with it.
0,127,9,JONAS,I know you are. I'm just saying that I'd be having
0,127,11,TEAL'C,"Probie, forget about it. Go on back to sleep, man."
0,127,11,JONAS,You sure you're okay?
0,127,11,TEAL'C,"Yeah. Yeah man, get out of here."
0,127,14,TEAL'C,Major Carter.
0,127,14,CARTER,Teal'c. I thought you were going to get in a few hours of
0,127,15,TEAL'C,I was unable to do so.
0,127,15,CARTER,Does that happen often?
0,127,15,TEAL'C,It is rare. Most often when recovering from an injury.
0,127,15,CARTER,You look okay to me. Why don't you try a glass of warm
0,127,16,TEAL'C,I would prefer not to consume bovine lactose at any
0,127,17,CARTER,"Cup of herbal tea, then? Can't hurt."
0,127,18,TEAL'C,Very well.
0,127,18,CARTER,You know you might be preoccupied with the upcoming mission.
0,127,21,CARTER,Don't deny you're worried about it; it's all over
0,127,22,TEAL'C,What's on my face?
0,127,23,O'NEILL,"You know, T, maybe Carter's right. You should think"
0,127,24,TEAL'C,What?
0,127,24,O'NEILL,The whole kidney thing.
0,127,24,TEAL'C,You're talking about the transplant.
0,127,24,CARTER,"Yeah, T man we're talking about the transplant."
0,127,24,TEAL'C,"Hey what do I need with two, right?"
0,127,24,JONAS,"Yeah, one'll do you right. Well isn't it true you can"
0,127,26,JONAS,I'll go check on breakfast.
0,127,26,O'NEILL,
0,127,26,TEAL'C,"I know that. Look, we've gotten second and third"
0,127,30,CARTER,All we're saying is if there was another option?
0,127,30,TEAL'C,It's already arranged and booked. I go in day after
0,127,32,JONAS,Gentlemen and Lady. Breakfast is served.
0,127,32,CARTER,That's Captain to you Probie and it better be good.
0,127,37,DESPATCH,"Rescue to engine 7, we have a 2 car head on collision with"
0,127,39,CARTER,"Roger that despatch, confirm location at Taylorway overpass."
0,127,39,DESPATCH,Roger that.
0,127,39,CARTER,
0,127,39,DESPATCH,Ten four.
0,127,39,CARTER,"Ten four, over and out."
0,127,40,TEAL'C,"Okay, Probie, great way to get your feet wet."
0,127,40,JONAS,Ready.
0,127,40,CARTER,Yes you are.
0,127,42,CARTER,"Probie, air up. Ray, stretch out a pre connect. Terry I want"
0,127,44,TEAL'C,Can you hear me?
0,127,45,FIREMAN,"Chief, we got one adult male and the kid trapped inside the"
0,127,47,FIREMAN,I got the gas leak.
0,127,47,CARTER,Great.
0,127,48,CARTER,"Hi there, can you hear me?"
0,127,49,CARTER,"Good boy. I need you to stay still, we're gonna get you"
0,127,52,CARTER,"Okay, give me a hand here. Let's pop"
0,127,55,TEAL'C,Hurry up with that clamp! It's all
0,127,60,CARTER,Let's get this fire out.
0,127,60,FIREMAN,Can't charge the line. No pressure.
0,127,62,O'NEILL,Everybody out of there!
0,127,63,CARTER,
0,127,64,BRA'TAC,Save yourself.
0,127,64,TEAL'C,I'm getting you out Old man.
0,127,64,BRA'TAC,Save yourself!
0,127,64,TEAL'C,No!
0,127,67,CARTER,Teal'c! Get a medical team down here now!
0,127,68,FRAISER,"Well whatever happened, you seem fine now. Still, I've"
0,127,69,TEAL'C,"I did not faint, Doctor Fraiser."
0,127,69,CARTER,Sorry Teal'c but you did. One minute I was talking about
0,127,71,FRAISER,"Well, kel'no'reem meditation is like sleep in the"
0,127,73,TEAL'C,No it would not.
0,127,73,FRAISER,And you're not in any pain?
0,127,73,TEAL'C,None.
0,127,73,CARTER,Maybe you were just bored of what I was saying?
0,127,74,CARTER,"No, fine. On that note, I'll say goodnight."
0,127,74,FRAISER,Night Sam.
0,127,74,CARTER,Prescribe him some warm milk.
0,127,74,TEAL'C,I have no intention of remaining here Dr Fraiser.
0,127,74,FRAISER,Teal'c this has never happened to you before so I do
0,127,75,TEAL'C,That would be completely..
0,127,75,FRAISER,
0,127,77,TEAL'C,Very well.
0,127,78,O'NEILL,You are one lucky son of a bitch.
0,127,78,TEAL'C,"O'Neill. Bray. Bray, he was in that car."
0,127,78,O'NEILL,What?
0,127,78,TEAL'C,He was in the car.
0,127,78,O'NEILL,Who was?
0,127,78,TEAL'C,Bray. Did you get him out?
0,127,78,O'NEILL,
0,127,79,TEAL'C,"The guy in the car, what happened to him?"
0,127,79,O'NEILL,"There's no way, he was dead before we got there."
0,127,79,TEAL'C,I could have sworn?
0,127,79,O'NEILL,"Listen, um, they're thinking of postponing the"
0,127,80,TEAL'C,I'm fine.
0,127,80,O'NEILL,Sure you are. How's your head?
0,127,80,TEAL'C,Pretty bad.
0,127,80,O'NEILL,Why don't I go see what Western medicine has for
0,127,81,TEAL'C,"Chief, thanks for being here for me, man."
0,127,81,O'NEILL,Any time.
0,127,84,O'NEILL,"Bray, you old fart, you still alive?"
0,127,84,BRAY,"Chief, you sorry excuse for a human being. When are you going"
0,127,85,O'NEILL,"Like a moth to flame, I can't help myself. Hi honey."
0,127,86,SHAUNA,Hi Jack. Isn't he awake?
0,127,86,O'NEILL,Yeah. He's got a little bit of a headache.
0,127,86,BRAY,"I'm not surprised he's in pain. He was sent flying, the"
0,127,87,O'NEILL,Yeah. Why don't you go in?
0,127,87,SHAUNA,Uh Jack? You go ahead without me. Did T say
0,127,88,O'NEILL,About thinking he was the guy in the car?
0,127,88,SHAUNA,"Yeah, I mean he's being mumbling in his sleep. Do you"
0,127,90,O'NEILL,This is a big deal. I think it'd mess with
0,127,92,SHAUNA,Thanks Jack.
0,127,93,SHAUNA,"I don't know what I would do, my love."
0,127,93,TEAL'C,You'll never have to know.
0,127,93,BRAY,You want to tell me what the hell you were thinking? Hmm?
0,127,93,TEAL'C,I guess I wasn't.
0,127,93,BRAY,We're fireman. There's putting your life on the line
0,127,94,TEAL'C,I know. I know.
0,127,94,SHAUNA,His only fault is he wants to help people.
0,127,94,BRAY,By sacrificing himself?
0,127,94,SHAUNA,Doesn't matter now. It's over. He's all right.
0,127,94,BRAY,No he's not.
0,127,94,TEAL'C,"Bray, what are talking about man? You're starting to"
0,127,95,BRAY,You should be scared.
0,127,95,SHAUNA,Bray.
0,127,95,BRAY,Why aren't you burned anywhere? The car exploded right in
0,127,98,TEAL'C,What is happening?
0,127,98,FRAISER,I'm sorry Teal'c; I didn't mean to wake you.
0,127,98,TEAL'C,Wake me?
0,127,98,FRAISER,"According to these readings, you've been fast asleep for"
0,127,99,TEAL'C,My mind was filled with images. Thoughts of me yet I was
0,127,100,FRAISER,Happens to humans all the time.
0,127,100,O'NEILL,"It's called dreaming, Teal'c."
0,127,100,FRAISER,You don't dream while in kel'no'reem meditation?
0,127,100,TEAL'C,Not in this manner. While in a state of
0,127,101,FRAISER,So how do you feel?
0,127,101,TEAL'C,It was so real.
0,127,101,O'NEILL,"Oooh, I love when that happens."
0,127,101,FRAISER,It's not uncommon especially in the first moments after
0,127,103,O'NEILL,"So, Doc this is Teal'c we're dealing with here,"
0,127,105,FRAISER,He's still better off than 99% of my patients. Tests
0,127,106,O'NEILL,Good. So he can go back to work?
0,127,106,FRAISER,"Yeah, so long as the dreams don't become debilitating or"
0,127,107,O'NEILL,Excellent. Let's go.
0,127,107,FRAISER,"Ah, just two more minutes Colonel. I'd like to perform a"
0,127,110,DANIEL,Hi.
0,127,111,TEAL'C,Hi.
0,127,111,DANIEL,I'm Doctor Daniel Jackson; I'm with the resident
0,127,112,TEAL'C,"So, Daniel Jackson."
0,127,112,DANIEL,"Ah, you can call me Daniel if you like."
0,127,112,TEAL'C,You think I'm crazy?
0,127,112,DANIEL,"No, not yet. We just met."
0,127,112,TEAL'C,We haven't met before?
0,127,112,DANIEL,"No, no I don't think so."
0,127,112,TEAL'C,I'm sure we have.
0,127,112,DANIEL,"Well maybe in another life or something like that, if you"
0,127,113,TEAL'C,About what?
0,127,113,DANIEL,Whatever's on your mind. Possibly about this operation
0,127,115,TEAL'C,I'm going through with it.
0,127,115,DANIEL,I never said you shouldn't go through with it but a
0,127,117,TEAL'C,Sure. You're the doctor.
0,127,117,DANIEL,Right. Let's go.
0,127,118,DANIEL,So how did Bray become your step father?
0,127,118,TEAL'C,"Technically, I guess he isn't, I just think of him"
0,127,119,DANIEL,"Good. You got a good job, you help people out and from what"
0,127,120,TEAL'C,"Yeah, well that was just plain stupid."
0,127,120,DANIEL,What was?
0,127,120,TEAL'C,What brought me here in the first place. We came on a
0,127,121,DANIEL,"You thought he was Bray, your step father."
0,127,121,TEAL'C,Who told you that?
0,127,121,DANIEL,"Your friends care about you, that's why they've asked"
0,127,122,TEAL'C,So?
0,127,122,DANIEL,"So, maybe you're afraid. Maybe subconsciously you're"
0,127,123,TEAL'C,The doctor told me I would lead a perfectly normal life
0,127,124,DANIEL,Self preservation is a powerful instinct.
0,127,124,TEAL'C,I'm not afraid Doc. Not one bit.
0,127,124,DANIEL,"That's quite a burden to carry, all that denial. And"
0,127,126,TEAL'C,No you can't stop me.
0,127,126,DANIEL,"Ah yes, I can actually and I will."
0,127,126,TEAL'C,Why?
0,127,126,DANIEL,In medicine we don't destroy one man's life to save
0,127,127,TEAL'C,Look at me Doc. I'm the healthiest damn human being
0,127,128,DANIEL,I'm not just talking about your body.
0,127,128,TEAL'C,Then what?
0,127,128,DANIEL,"You've been having nightmares, almost every night, from"
0,127,129,TEAL'C,Big deal.
0,127,129,DANIEL,"And? And it's a big and, yesterday you had a full blown"
0,127,132,TEAL'C,I want to save Bray.
0,127,132,DANIEL,I know you do. And I want to help you do that. That is a
0,127,135,TEAL'C,"What is it Doc, is my hour up already?"
0,127,135,DANIEL,"No actually your twenty minutes are up, we'll work our"
0,127,138,O'NEILL,Hey. Let's go. You know how much it costs to keep
0,127,140,TEAL'C,I'm ready.
0,127,140,O'NEILL,"Good, let's move out. What's wrong with you?"
0,127,140,TEAL'C,Nothing is wrong O'Neill.
0,127,140,O'NEILL,I need you to focus.
0,127,140,TEAL'C,I am ready.
0,127,140,O'NEILL,All right then.
0,127,143,APOPHIS,You are afraid to die.
0,127,143,TEAL'C,No.
0,127,143,APOPHIS,Because you know I will be waiting for you in the afterlife.
0,127,143,TEAL'C,Who are you?
0,127,143,APOPHIS,You know who I am Teal'c. I am your God.
0,127,143,TEAL'C,No!
0,127,143,NURSE,Excuse me sir? Are you lost?
0,127,145,TEAL'C,No I'm..
0,127,145,NURSE,Are you sure you're all right?
0,127,145,TEAL'C,I'm fine. Wrong room. Sorry.
0,127,146,NURSE,"Sir, sir?"
0,127,148,APOPHIS,"You cannot escape your fate, shol'va."
0,127,149,O'NEILL,"Hey come on, let's go. You know how much it costs to"
0,127,150,TEAL'C,Something is wrong.
0,127,150,CARTER,What is it?
0,127,150,TEAL'C,He must have taken it.
0,127,150,JONAS,Who must have taken what?
0,127,151,O'NEILL,Shut it down.
0,127,152,O'NEILL,Teal'c?
0,127,152,TEAL'C,My symbiote is gone.
0,127,152,O'NEILL,Fraiser just gave you a clean bill of health.
0,127,152,TEAL'C,My symbiote is gone! My symbiote is gone!
0,127,152,O'NEILL,Get a medical team down here right now.
0,127,152,TEAL'C,"Help me, help me."
0,127,153,TEAL'C,Hold on old man.
0,127,155,TEAL'C,"Help me, help me."
0,127,155,SHAUNA,"It's just a nightmare, you're safe."
0,127,156,TEAL'C,I was in the hospital.
0,127,156,SHAUNA,That's right. They performed the transplant and you
0,127,157,TEAL'C,I don't remember.
0,127,157,SHAUNA,You saved his life.
0,127,157,TEAL'C,I don't remember coming home.
0,127,157,SHAUNA,But you are home. With me. And everything's all right.
0,127,158,TEAL'C,O'Neill. O'Neill picked me up and he took me home.
0,127,158,SHAUNA,That's right. Bray's gonna be fine. And so are you.
0,127,159,TEAL'C,"I feel like? Shauna, I feel like I'm going insane."
0,127,159,SHAUNA,A few bad dreams.
0,127,159,TEAL'C,"You can't tell anyone about this, okay? Because I"
0,127,160,SHAUNA,I promise.
0,127,160,TEAL'C,"When I'm there, this is the dream."
0,127,160,SHAUNA,When you're there?
0,127,160,TEAL'C,I'm part of something. Military or underground.
0,127,161,SHAUNA,"Sweetheart, I don't understand what you're saying."
0,127,161,TEAL'C,I'm serious.
0,127,161,SHAUNA,It's dreams.
0,127,161,TEAL'C,They say this is the dream. And when I'm there I
0,127,163,SHAUNA,"Honey, Look at me. Look at me. Kiss me. How can that not be"
0,127,166,BRAY,Hey. How're you feeling?
0,127,166,TEAL'C,Better. And you?
0,127,166,BRAY,They haven't told you? They say my body's rejecting the
0,127,167,TEAL'C,What?
0,127,167,BRAY,They're pumping me full of anti-rejection drugs. This and
0,127,169,TEAL'C,Come on Bray; don't even start talking like that!
0,127,169,BRAY,Why are we so afraid of dying? I'm not afraid.
0,127,169,TEAL'C,"I am, okay. I'd rather die myself than let you go. So"
0,127,172,DANIEL,Am I late? I thought I was supposed to be at eleven?
0,127,172,TEAL'C,It is.
0,127,172,DANIEL,Oh. Been up to see Bray?
0,127,172,TEAL'C,Just came from there.
0,127,172,DANIEL,How's he doing?
0,127,172,TEAL'C,His body is rejecting the new kidney.
0,127,172,DANIEL,Well you knew that might happen.
0,127,172,TEAL'C,There's got to be something we can do.
0,127,172,DANIEL,You've done everything humanly possible.
0,127,172,TEAL'C,I didn't go through this so Bray could die.
0,127,172,DANIEL,"Why are you going through this? I mean, why do you think this"
0,127,173,TEAL'C,The nightmares are gone.
0,127,173,DANIEL,You're not dreaming you're part of some secret
0,127,174,TEAL'C,Shauna told you.
0,127,174,DANIEL,No.
0,127,174,TEAL'C,Then how the hell do you know?
0,127,174,DANIEL,"I just know, it doesn't matter."
0,127,174,TEAL'C,Fine. I'll ask her myself.
0,127,174,DANIEL,Because we've talked about this before. You just
0,127,177,TEAL'C,"I'm part of something, a team."
0,127,177,DANIEL,Who's on this team?
0,127,177,TEAL'C,"Same as at the fire hall. Chief O'Neill, Captain"
0,127,178,DANIEL,Probie is who?
0,127,178,TEAL'C,Probationary fireman. It's the same as calling
0,127,179,DANIEL,Right.
0,127,179,TEAL'C,His name's Jonas.
0,127,179,DANIEL,And what does this team do? The one in your dream?
0,127,179,TEAL'C,"Go places, you know, try to make a difference. Help"
0,127,180,DANIEL,You're a fireman.
0,127,180,TEAL'C,No we um?
0,127,180,DANIEL,You're just gonna have to trust me.
0,127,180,TEAL'C,All right. We go to other planets through a big ring of
0,127,181,DANIEL,You're a?
0,127,181,TEAL'C,A jaffa. I carry this thing round in my gut that's
0,127,182,DANIEL,"Something like a kidney, something you might be hesitant to"
0,127,183,TEAL'C,Which one? Hell I don't even know what's real any
0,127,184,DANIEL,You're not alone in that. Lot's of people have been
0,127,187,TEAL'C,They're both so real.
0,127,187,DANIEL,And both you're having nightmares?
0,127,187,TEAL'C,"Hell, I'm not even supposed to dream in the other one."
0,127,187,DANIEL,Because you're jaffa?
0,127,187,TEAL'C,Don't ask me.
0,127,187,DANIEL,I mean it's really neither here nor there; the point is
0,127,188,TEAL'C,No.
0,127,188,DANIEL,So you're trying to figure out which of the two lives you
0,127,191,TEAL'C,What?
0,127,191,DANIEL,"Think about it. If you can't distinguish between them, if"
0,127,193,TEAL'C,Then what do I do?
0,127,193,DANIEL,"Hang in there, just a little while longer."
0,127,194,TEAL'C,Hey you can't leave me here like this!
0,127,194,DANIEL,I haven't left your side Teal'c. And I'm not
0,127,196,TEAL'C,O'Neill.
0,127,196,FRAISER,It's okay.
0,127,196,O'NEILL,"Yeah, you're gonna be all right, just hang in there."
0,127,196,FRAISER,"Teal'c, listen to me okay. This is very important. How"
0,127,197,TEAL'C,Bra'tac?
0,127,197,FRAISER,"It's okay, it's okay. He's alive, thanks to you"
0,127,198,TEAL'C,You must save Bra'tac!
0,127,198,FRAISER,We'll do our best okay. Let's take them both
0,127,200,HAMMOND,What happened Colonel?
0,127,200,O'NEILL,It was a set up from the get go Sir.
0,127,200,HAMMOND,Meeting of the rebel leaders?
0,127,200,O'NEILL,There was no meeting. It was an ambush.
0,127,200,CARTER,We found over a hundred rebel jaffa dead. Every single one of
0,127,201,O'NEILL,Bra'tac.
0,127,201,JONAS,He and Teal'c were the only warriors left alive.
0,127,201,HAMMOND,Teal'c left for this meeting over three days ago. How
0,127,202,CARTER,"Sir, it's possible Teal'c survived the ambush and"
0,127,203,JONAS,He knew we'd show up as soon as he was late.
0,127,203,HAMMOND,Well how long can two jaffa survive with only one symbiote
0,127,204,CARTER,"We've no idea Sir. Up until a couple of hours ago, we"
0,127,205,HAMMOND,Report to the briefing room in one hour.
0,127,205,O'NEILL,Yes Sir.
0,127,206,FRAISER,We've managed to stabilise them by using the same method
0,127,208,HAMMOND,How long can you keep them both alive that way?
0,127,208,FRAISER,I really don't know Sir. It's a miracle they've
0,127,209,JONAS,"Dr Fraiser, forgive the obvious, but why can't we just get"
0,127,210,CARTER,We've looked into it. It's all but impossible right
0,127,211,JONAS,Right.
0,127,211,HAMMOND,We contacted the Tok'ra as soon as we received your
0,127,213,O'NEILL,"Sir, if it comes down to a choice?"
0,127,213,HAMMOND,"Jack, we have to consider that Teal'c has already made a"
0,127,215,O'NEILL,Well let's hope it doesn't come down to that.
0,127,216,CARTER,Dad. Thank God you're here.
0,127,216,JACOB,Hopefully I'm not too late.
0,127,217,JONAS,How are they?
0,127,217,TEAL'C,Shauna.
0,127,217,JONAS,Shauna?
0,127,217,FRAISER,Shau'nac. She was very important in Teal'c's
0,127,220,JONAS,"Yeah. Teal'c, you gotta hang in there. I need you. You"
0,127,221,TEAL'C,Don't worry about it Probie. Go back to sleep.
0,127,221,JONAS,Probie?
0,127,222,JACOB,Dr Fraiser. What's their condition?
0,127,222,FRAISER,They're critical. All three of them.
0,127,222,O'NEILL,Three?
0,127,222,FRAISER,Due to his advanced age and the fact that his body is
0,127,225,JONAS,What about a hand device?
0,127,225,JACOB,I've brought something better. Something that should work
0,127,226,O'NEILL,What's that?
0,127,226,CARTER,Tretonin sir.
0,127,227,JONAS,The drug the Pangarans offered us?
0,127,227,O'NEILL,Whoa. That's ground Goa'uld isn't it?
0,127,227,JACOB,"It's a little more refined than that Jack, but yes it is"
0,127,228,CARTER,"It supplanted the immune systems in the Pangarans, why"
0,127,229,FRAISER,"I've already considered it, it won't work. The"
0,127,230,JACOB,We've since refined it specifically for jaffa physiology.
0,127,233,FRAISER,"But even if it does work, I mean, Teal'c and Bra'tac"
0,127,234,JACOB,"Given time, we can solve that problem. But at least"
0,127,235,FRAISER,If I knew for a fact that this is what Teal'c wanted..
0,127,235,CARTER,"Janet, this could ultimately lead to freedom from Goa'uld"
0,127,236,HAMMOND,Do it.
0,127,236,FRAISER,Yes sir.
0,127,236,O'NEILL,Teal'c without Junior. That's a concept.
0,127,237,DANIEL,Hey Teal'c.
0,127,237,TEAL'C,Am I dreaming?
0,127,237,DANIEL,"No, not this time. It's late, everyone's gone home"
0,127,238,TEAL'C,What of Bra'tac?
0,127,238,DANIEL,Bra'tac's fine. Thanks to you.
0,127,238,TEAL'C,And to you as well I believe.
0,127,238,DANIEL,"No, no that was you. I don't know anyone that could have"
0,127,241,TEAL'C,This experience has been very different for me. It seemed
0,127,242,DANIEL,Your mind took you where it needed to go. I promise you this
0,127,244,TEAL'C,Is that a promise Daniel Jackson?
0,127,244,DANIEL,That's a promise.
