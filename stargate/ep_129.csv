0,129,0,"""PROPHECY""","By Joseph Mallozzi & Paul Mullie Int, CASSANDRA in Sickbay, sitting in a bed. On a retractable table in front of her sits a traveling chessboard, a little above it floats a chess piece in mid-air, spinning top over bottom. The girl's gaze is focused on it as DR. FRAISER enters, looking at the chess piece in a chiding manner."
0,129,0,FRAISER,"Cassandra, what are you doing?"
0,129,0,CASSANDRA,It helps to do this.
0,129,1,JACKSON,"Hok'Taur is actually a hybrid of two Goa'uld words, ""Hok"" which means advanced, and ""Taur"", which, I believe, is a sort of slang..."
0,129,1,O'NEILL,For ...?
0,129,1,TEAL'C,Human.
0,129,1,JACKSON,"So essentially, it's advanced human: ""Hok Tauri"""
0,129,1,TEAL'C,Such an advanced human will represent a powerful host for the Goa'uld.
0,129,1,SAM,Which explains why Nirrti was performing the experiments.
0,129,2,NIRRTI,Those few thousand years on another world have changed you more than you know...
0,129,3,NIRRTI,I could make you more powerful than you could imagine. The powers you've seen in Wodan and the others - only a fraction of what I could give you.
0,129,4,ELORI,"I must apologize, Colonel. This is a meager feast to offer visitors from another world."
0,129,5,O'NEILL,No need to apologize. It ap-- --pears delicious. He and Sam exchange pleading looks.
0,129,5,ELORI,We are a poor people. We are forced to spend most of our time in the mines.
0,129,5,CHAZEN,For the greater glory of Baal.
0,129,6,ELORI,Of course.
0,129,6,SAM,"That's interesting. Because, according to our information, Baal abandoned this place a hundred years ago when the Naqadah mines ran dry."
0,129,6,ELORI,"The Naqadah is scarce and difficult to extract, but there are still deposits. In the background, we see Jonas fidgeting a little, looking rather pale. Teal'c notices and addresses him."
0,129,6,TEAL'C,"Are you feeling unwell, Jonas Quinn?"
0,129,6,JONAS,"I'm fine, just ... uh ... it's hot. Carter reacts."
0,129,6,CHAZEN,"It is true we have not seen Lord Baal in many generations, but we continue to pay him tribute through his emissary, Lord Mot."
0,129,6,O'NEILL,You expecting this guy anytime soon?
0,129,6,ELORI,"He will arrive in twelve days, at the rising of the full moon. We pan across Elori and CHAZEN, then we see Jonas, who is noticeably flushed. He seems to be weary, then blinks to clear his view. A flash of light, and we see a vague ""flashback""-style sequence. We see CHAZEN, sternly addressing Elori."
0,129,6,CHAZEN,"Stop talking like an old fool. It'd be madness to defy Lord Mot! We flash back to Jonas, who closes his eyes for a moment, obviously trying to compose himself, rubbing his eyes. CHAZEN doesn't seem happy at the turn of the conversation as Elori continues..."
0,129,6,ELORI,"With each passing year, the mining grows more difficult. Soon it may be impossible to meet Lord Mot's demands. But we have no choice. They are gods, after all. Are they not?"
0,129,7,CHAZEN,"Well, they have great power, that's all we need to know."
0,129,7,ELORI,"That is true, however..."
0,129,7,CHAZEN,"Elori! Teal'c, Sam and Jack have gained interest, and so..."
0,129,7,JACK,However... what?
0,129,7,ELORI,"We have an ancient prophecy, that one day strangers would come through the Chappa'ai to slay the gods, and free our people. Now, you have arrived. And you also carry weapons of great power."
0,129,7,CHAZEN,"Stop talking like an old fool. It'd be madness to defy Lord Mot! Jonas is looking a little surprised at hearing this very phrase. He gets up painfully, turning from the table."
0,129,7,O'NEILL,Jonas?
0,129,7,JONAS,"I need some air... Sam looks up at her teammate, surprised. He takes a step from the table, then slumps to the ground. Sam immediately runs up to him, checking his temperature..."
0,129,7,SAM,Jonas!
0,129,10,FRAISER,"Preliminary tests seem to indicate that Jonas is in perfect health. But given his history with Naquadria research I thought it would be prudent to do an MRI. Now, it shows an area of unusual brain activity right about here."
0,129,10,HAMMOND,Any explanation?
0,129,10,FRAISER,No sir. In fact I don't even know if this has anything to do with what happened on the planet.
0,129,11,JONAS,I had a dizzy spell! It was probably the food.
0,129,11,FRAISER,"Maybe, but I don't want to take any chances. I've scheduled a series of follow-up exams."
0,129,11,MARTIN WOOD,
0,129,11,HAMMOND,Very well. Hammond EXITS.
0,129,12,PETER DELUISE,
0,129,13,SAM,"According to Tok'Ra intelligence, not only did Baal abandon P4S-237 over a hundred years ago, but to the best of their knowledge he no longer receives any Naquadah shipments from the planet."
0,129,13,DAMIAN KINDLER,
0,129,13,HAMMOND,So where is it going?
0,129,13,SAM,"Well, perhaps this Lord Mot is keeping it for himself?"
0,129,13,HAMMOND,What do we know about him?
0,129,13,JONAS,"He was the, uh... Canaanite god of death. According to mythology, he was defeated by Baal and then forced to live in the underworld."
0,129,13,ANDY MIKITA,
0,129,13,TEAL'C,"In all likelihood, there was a power struggle. Baal defeated Mot and forced him into servitude."
0,129,13,JACK,Maybe he... doesn't wanna serve anymore...
0,129,13,TEAL'C,"If he is stockpiling Naquadah without Baal's knowledge, he may well be planning to move against him."
0,129,13,SAM,"Sir, if we're right about this and Baal no longer has any knowledge of what's happening on the planet, it's possible we could free these people. If the system lords think this planet's worthless, then we wouldn't have to worry about someone coming in to take his place."
0,129,13,HAMMOND,Did they ask for our help?
0,129,13,JACK,mmm.... Not exactly.
0,129,13,SAM,"I think they were afraid to come out and ask directly, but they did hint that they no longer believed the Goa'uld were gods."
0,129,13,HAMMOND,"What do you think, Colonel?"
0,129,13,O'NEILL,I think we're going to need a lot more intel.
0,129,14,SAM,"Hey, you wanna get some lunch? It's Mexican today. The flashback ends on Jonas, who is in the same position as before, while we hear..."
0,129,14,SAM,"According to Elori, Mot isn't due to return for another twelve days, that gives us plenty of time."
0,129,14,HAMMOND,"I'll contact the Pentagon. He gets up, and we see Jonas, still perplexed by his vision."
0,129,15,SAM,"Hey, you wanna get some lunch? It's Mexican today. Jonas is visibly spooked, staring at his teammate, the book still in his hand. Sam lowers her head, staring back in confusion."
0,129,15,SAM,What?
0,129,15,JONAS,I knew you were gonna say that...
0,129,15,SAM,"What are you talking about? She walks around him as he turns back to the desk, him looking at the book, her at the table."
0,129,15,JONAS,"Before, when we were in the briefing room, I had a ... I don't know... it was like a vision ... He flaps the book shut, holding it closed with both hands and turns at the door, where Sam just came in."
0,129,15,JONAS,"... I was standing here, holding this notebook ... you came in and said what you said."
0,129,15,SAM,"When you think you're re-living a moment, it's called a déjà vu. It's normal. It... It's said to be caused by a split-second delay in sense perception."
0,129,15,ROBERT C. COOPER,
0,129,15,JONAS,"No, this was different. It was the same on the planet, I ... saw something and it happened."
0,129,15,SAM,When?
0,129,15,JONAS,"Just before I passed out. I didn't say anything 'cause I didn't think anything of it at the time, but now it's happened twice. Sam reacts, looking concerned."
0,129,16,FRAISER,Sir? We just completed a second MRI. There's still nothing to suggest that Jonas's previous exposure to Naquadria has anything to do with this.
0,129,16,HAMMOND,"According to Major Carter, he claims to be having visions."
0,129,16,FRAISER,"H-hm. He's also beginning to suffer from headaches. I know the symptoms appear to be similar to what happened to these scientists on Kelowna, but there are no indications of schizophrenia. There is, however, a small spot on this MRI that has me worried. She hands him the sheet."
0,129,16,HAMMOND,You know what it is?
0,129,16,FRAISER,"I'm not sure, but it could be a tumor."
0,129,16,HAMMOND,Is this what caused him to pass out?
0,129,16,FRAISER,It's possible.
0,129,16,FRAISER,"Sir, I ... think it would be best if you took Jonas off of active duty. Hammond reacts."
0,129,17,JONAS,This is ridiculous.
0,129,17,O'NEILL,Fraiser's just covering all the bases.
0,129,17,JONAS,"Ahhh... something else has to be going on here. Whatever she saw ... in that MRI has to have something to do with these visions I'm having, I mean ... can't be just coincidence."
0,129,18,JONAS,What? You guys didn't believe me when I saw those alien creatures. They turned out to be real. They exchange a pointed look.
0,129,18,O'NEILL,So... you're seeing things before they happen?
0,129,18,JONAS,... That's right.
0,129,18,O'NEILL,"Like ... what's for lunch? Sam shoots him a LOOK, sighs soundlessly. O'Neill reacts. Jonas begins looking a little dizzy again, blinking more often. He sits down as he answers..."
0,129,18,JONAS,"No, I can't control it, they're just ... flashes."
0,129,18,TEAL'C,"We have encountered many strange Phenomena, Jonas Quinn, but ... we have yet to meet anyone that can see the future."
0,129,18,SAM,"It ... goes against all the laws of physics as we understand it. Have you had any more? Jonas is staring ahead in concentration, focusing on a couple of air molecules inches before his nose. Sam lowers her head, Jack looks concerned. He raises his eyebrows as he says..."
0,129,18,JACK,"Jonas? Jonas looks around a little disorientedly, then looks ahead again as he announces..."
0,129,18,JONAS,"The Tok'ra are coming. Jack looks at him skeptically, Teal'c raises an eyebrow and inclines his head , Sam exchanges a glance with O'Neill. . Suddenly, Klaxons go off in the background. We see Jonas, Teal'c and Sam glancing at the P.A. somewhere above as O'Neill is wearing his ""I'm not going to admit that I'm wrong""-look."
0,129,18,P.A.,Unscheduled off-world activation.
0,129,18,JONAS,Her name is Sina. We end on a shot at Jonas as he rubs his forehead and announces this.
0,129,19,HAMMOND,
0,129,19,SINA,"We have further information about the System Lord Baal. A strange silence emanates from our main team. O'Neill stares in surprise, as if going to object, mouth half-opened. Sam looks at him, as if dreading what he's about to say."
0,129,19,HAMMOND,Is there a problem?
0,129,19,O'NEILL,No Sir.
0,129,19,HAMMOND,"Please. He offers her a seat as they sit down O'Neill and Teal'c take seats next to Sina, Hammond is to her right, at the head of the table. Another SF is standing in the background as if this just cost him is washroom break. O'Neill is looking at the Tok'ra as if she was contagious."
0,129,19,SINA,Baal has suffered a recent military defeat at the hands of Lord Yu. Anubis is said to be very disappointed.
0,129,19,SAM,It's hard to believe that Yu hasn't been destroyed yet.
0,129,19,SINA,"Given that he is the only System Lord still in opposition to Anubis, his persistence is remarkable."
0,129,19,O'NEILL,"You go, Yu! There is silence at O'Neill's quip, Sam smirks a little. O'Neill rolls his eyes in defeat. The Tok'ra is sporting a ""The Queen is not amused"" look."
0,129,19,SINA,"Baal's recent campaign was meant to be a final crushing blow, but he allowed Yu to escape his grasp and suffered heavy losses in the process."
0,129,19,O'NEILL,"So, he screwed up and his boss is pissed at him now, eh?"
0,129,19,SINA,"If I understand you correctly, yes. That would be a fair assessment."
0,129,19,TEAL'C,"Clearly, Baal is in a vulnerable position. This may be an ideal time for Mot to move against him."
0,129,19,SAM,"If he moves up to the rank of System Lord, he won't have to keep his operation on 237 secret anymore. He could garrison the planet."
0,129,19,JONAS,"So, if we're gonna help them, we'd better do it soon. The Tok'ra nods in assent."
0,129,20,SAM,Another headache?
0,129,20,JONAS,... yeah. He rubs his forehead as Sam approaches. This situation has clearly caught her fancy.
0,129,20,SAM,"Jonas, none of us had ever met that Tok'ra before. There's no way you could have known her name."
0,129,20,JONAS,"I can't explain it. I saw her in the briefing room, General Hammond said her name, and then a few minutes later it happened. Teal'c said that you've never encountered aliens with precognitive abilities, right?"
0,129,20,SAM,"Yeah, we haven't."
0,129,20,JONAS,But we have come across other psychic powers.
0,129,20,SAM,On P3X-367.
0,129,20,JONAS,"Wodan was telekinetic, Eggar was telepathic. Then there was Cassandra."
0,129,20,SAM,You think that Nirrti has something to do with this.
0,129,20,JONAS,It's very possible. She had me in that gene spicing machine for over an hour. What if she did something to me?
0,129,21,FRAISER,"It's hard to say without a biopsy, but all of my tests seem to indicate that the tumor is not made up of cancer cells."
0,129,21,HAMMOND,Then what is it?
0,129,21,FRAISER,I'm not sure. But I do know that it's grown by over 50 per cent since the last test. I've never seen anything like it.
0,129,21,HAMMOND,What can we do?
0,129,21,FRAISER,"I recommend immediate surgery. If we don't get it out of him soon, the intra-cranial pressure is going to kill him. Hammond looks less than happy, and we get a slightly too loud strings solo."
0,129,23,FRAISER,I've called in a neuro-surgeon. Her name is Sandy van Densen. She's the best there is.
0,129,23,JONAS,I'm not completely convinced that surgery is the right way to deal with this.
0,129,23,FRAISER,"Jonas, it's going to kill you."
0,129,23,JONAS,You don't know that. We don't even know what it is!
0,129,23,SAM,Jonas and I have been discussing the possibility that this has something to do with Nirrti. That it's another step towards the creation of Hok'tar.
0,129,23,FRAISER,So you think this is the result of genetic manipulation?
0,129,23,SAM,Jonas thinks the new tissue in his brain is somehow giving him pre-cognitive abilities.
0,129,23,FRAISER,"Well, for all I know you may be right. But that doesn't change the fact that if this tumor continues to grow at its current rate, it is still going to kill you."
0,129,23,JONAS,It may stabilize.
0,129,23,JACK,Nirrti never did anything to anyone that didn't turn out badly.
0,129,23,JONAS,"Colonel, you of all people should realize what an advantage this could be. Imagine if we could know in advance when and where the next Goa'uld attack would come from."
0,129,23,TEAL'C,You have yet to provide such valuable information.
0,129,23,JONAS,All I'm saying is just give me some more time. At least ... forty-eight hours.
0,129,23,HAMMOND,"Make it twenty-four, and you remain on-base for observation."
0,129,23,JONAS,What about the mission?
0,129,23,HAMMOND,"You're going to sit this one out. Colonel, I want you to take the rest of SG-1 and SG-15 back to the planet for a full tactical assessment. If there's a real chance we can free these people from the Goa'uld, I wanna know about it."
0,129,23,JACK,"Yes, Sir."
0,129,23,HAMMOND,Dismissed. They get up and leave.
0,129,24,FRAISER,Blood pressure's a little high. How are the headaches?
0,129,24,JONAS,Not good.
0,129,24,FRAISER,"Jonas, why are you doing this?"
0,129,24,JONAS,Even limited precognitive abilities would be invaluable to our work.
0,129,24,FRAISER,"Hm. You still think you have to keep proving yourself, don't you? You know, you might want to consider the possibility that you're valuable enough already. Let's run another EEG."
0,129,24,FEMALE NURSE,"Yes, Doctor. Jonas is sitting there, staring vacantly ahead again. Fraiser notices, looks at him in concern. He doesn't notice her."
0,129,24,FRAISER,"Jonas? We get another flashback as Jonas' eyes widen: One of the SGC corridors. Fraiser is running towards a stretcher, another male nurse is with her. A male and a female nurse are hurrying the stretcher around the corner in a hurry."
0,129,24,FRAISER,How's she doing?
0,129,24,FEMALE NURSE,Respirations are shallow. Pulse is weak. We see that it is Major Carter on the stretcher. She appears to have a burnt wound at her shoulder. We zoom back to see we've been watching over Jonas' shoulder.
0,129,24,FRAISER,"Sam, can you hear me? Sam?"
0,129,24,FEMALE NURSE,I've lost the pulse.
0,129,24,FRAISER,She's in V-fib! Anything?
0,129,24,FEMALE NURSE,Nothing.
0,129,24,FRAISER,Charge to two hundred.
0,129,24,FEMALE NURSE,Charging.
0,129,24,FRAISER,"Clear! We see Jonas watching the scene with frightened calmness, then the flashback ends and we find ourselves in..."
0,129,25,FRAISER,Jonas!
0,129,26,JONAS,Colonel! Colonel! You have to scrub the mission.
0,129,26,JACK,Why?
0,129,26,JONAS,"Major Carter gets hurt, I saw it."
0,129,26,HAMMOND,"Colonel O'Neill, what the hell is going on down there?"
0,129,27,JONAS,It was a medical emergency. Major Carter was being rushed to the infirmary with what appeared to be a staff blast wound.
0,129,27,TEAL'C,"According to the villagers, we will not encounter any Jaffa for many days."
0,129,27,JONAS,"Well, maybe they're wrong, or maybe they lied, we can't know for sure."
0,129,27,SAM,"Well that's just it, Jonas, there's no way we can know. Maybe it's not even supposed to happen on this mission, it could be weeks from now."
0,129,27,JONAS,I don't think I can see that far ahead.
0,129,27,SAM,The point is we can't start second-guessing every decision. It's a calculated risk every time we step through that gate.
0,129,27,HAMMOND,"I agree Major. However, until I have a better understanding of what's going on, I'd prefer to err on the side of caution."
0,129,27,JACK,Was ... anybody else hurt on this ... thing?
0,129,27,JONAS,I only saw Major Carter.
0,129,27,JACK,"Well, then she can sit this one out ... just ... to be on the safe side."
0,129,27,HAMMOND,"Agreed. But Colonel, be careful."
0,129,27,JACK,"... Yes, Sir."
0,129,29,O'NEILL,"Major Pierce, report!"
0,129,29,PIERCE,"We swept the whole building, Sir. There's no sign of any Jaffa activity."
0,129,29,ELORI,"As I said, Lord Mot will not arrive for many days."
0,129,29,O'NEILL,"All right, stay sharp. O'Neill out."
0,129,29,ELORI,Have you decided to help us?
0,129,29,O'NEILL,Are you sure this is what you want?
0,129,29,ELORI,It is as the prophecy foretold.
0,129,29,O'NEILL,"No, screw the prophecy! I need to know your people are willing to follow through on this."
0,129,29,ELORI,"Last winter, there was a terrible sickness in the village. Many could not work. When Lord Mot arrived and there was not enough Naquadah, we tried to explain. We begged his forgiveness, but he would not listen. He took ten of the sickest, including my daughter's husband, and executed them in front of the whole village. We would do anything to be free of this burden. Jack looks seriously. That was convincing."
0,129,32,VOICE ON PA,"""We have a medical emergency on level 25. We have a medical emergency on level"
0,129,33,JONAS,"""What happened?"" He catches up with Siler who is walking to the infirmary."
