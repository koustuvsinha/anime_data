0,13,0,"""SINGULARITY""","By Robert C. Cooper The team are in the gate room, preparing to go through the gate"
0,13,0,DANIEL,"So, what exactly are we going to see after this eclipse begins? I mean it is black. And it's a hole."
0,13,0,JACK,"Well, it might be a black hole."
0,13,0,DANIEL,"Okay, let me put that a different way."
0,13,0,SAM,"No Daniel, you're right, you can't actually see it, not the singularity itself it's so massive not even light can escape it. But during the totality phase of the eclipse, we should be able to see matter spiraling towards it."
0,13,0,JACK,Actually it's called the Accretion Disc. Sam and Teal'c stop to look at Jack. Daniel goes on.
0,13,0,DANIEL,Well I guess it's easy to understand why the local population would be afraid of something like that...what did you just say?
0,13,0,JACK,It's just an astronomical term.
0,13,0,SAM,"You didn't think the Colonel has a telescope on his roof just to look at his neighbours, did you?"
0,13,1,JACK,Not initially.
0,13,2,TEAL'C,Someone from SG7 should have been here to greet us.
0,13,2,JACK,They should be prepping the telescope for the big show.
0,13,3,JACK,Oh god! Alright Mapp Four.
0,13,4,JACK,"All right, Daniel, you and Teal'c check the village. See why noone's missed this guy, where everyone is. We've got the observatory. All right, move out."
0,13,5,SAM,Where is everyone?
0,13,6,JACK,Found them.
0,13,6,SAM,My god.
0,13,7,DANIEL,"Jack! Jack! They're all dead, everyone."
0,13,9,JANET,This complex has been totally decontaminated. How many dead?
0,13,9,SAM,We estimate a thousand.
0,13,9,JANET,"Why didn't they send a message, some warning this was happening?"
0,13,9,JACK,We don't know.
0,13,9,DANIEL,Looks like all this happened very quickly.
0,13,9,SAM,"Now there could still be survivors out there, shouldn't we be looking for them?"
0,13,9,JANET,"No, not until I examine you, will use the barracks room. Colonel, you said you touched one of the victims before putting on gloves?"
0,13,9,JACK,"Yeah, but I washed my hands right away."
0,13,9,JANET,"No, you're first."
0,13,10,JACK,Allergies right? Right?
0,13,10,JANET,Right.
0,13,11,SAM,We're supposed to tag the bodies with these.
0,13,11,DANIEL,They knew this would happen.
0,13,11,SAM,The indigenous people?
0,13,11,DANIEL,"They told me when we came here three months ago, that with darkness would come the apocalypse. It was part of their mythology, and what did we tell them? It's just an eclipse, and there's nothing to worry about."
0,13,12,SAM,"Hello? It's okay, you can come out. I know I must look pretty scary in this mask but I'm not going to hurt you. It's okay. Colonel, there's someone in the bushes and they won't come out."
0,13,13,JACK,Show' them your face. Try to look friendly.
0,13,14,TEAL'C,"We will not hurt you, please come out.Take my hand.It is okay."
0,13,16,SAM,It's okay. Don't worry everything is going to be fine.Can you hear me? Very brave.Can I take this mask off?
0,13,16,JANET,"I think it will be okay. It looks like were dealing with a bacteria infection, just don't get two close."
0,13,16,SAM,"There, that's better, huh? You feel like telling me your name now?That's okay, you remember my name?Samantha Carter, but you can call me Sam."
0,13,17,SAM,"Oh, no, no, no, honey. You're not going to die. Why don't you just lay down and rest for awhile, okay? Okay."
0,13,17,JANET,This can't be.
0,13,17,SAM,She's infected isn't she?
0,13,17,JANET,"No, she's not."
0,13,17,SAM,"Well, what's wrong then?"
0,13,17,JANET,There a traces of the element the Stargate is made of in her blood.
0,13,17,SAM,Naquadah?
0,13,17,JANET,Yeah. Now it's possible that's the reason she was able to resist the infection.
0,13,18,JANET,"Thank you, will you take a look?"
0,13,19,JANET,"Well I have some bad news. The samples show the entire area to be contaminated. It's in the water and the ground. Now the bacteria doesn't seem to be airborne, but it has a unique ability to survive in a variety of environments"
0,13,19,DANIEL,Listen. I hate to sound self centered here but.
0,13,19,JANET,Your test's are fine.
0,13,19,TEAL'C,What of the girl?
0,13,19,JANET,No sign of the infection and as a procession I did an ultrasound to make sure she wasn't parasiticly infested with a Goa'uld.
0,13,19,JACK,So she goes back with us?
0,13,19,SAM,"Doctor, would it be safe for someone to stay a little while longer? I mean we're safe right now aren't we?"
0,13,19,JACK,Captain?
0,13,19,SAM,"Sir, the eclipse happens in less then one day. This is our only opportunity to use this window of darkness, to photograph this black whole with this telescope. It could change the course of human history. I don't want to belittle what's happened here, but if we just pack up and leave, SG-7 and all these people will have died for nothing."
0,13,20,JACK,Well you won't be staying.
0,13,20,TEAL'C,"I will remain, I am not at risk."
0,13,20,JACK,"Yeah, I'll stay too."
0,13,21,SAM,"Hey, you okay? Don't be afraid, I'll be holding your hand the whole way, all right? I know it looks kind of scary, but it's really a lot of fun. On three, one, two, three!"
0,13,22,SOLDER,"Level one decontamination complete, proceed with level two."
0,13,22,SAM,"Hey, it's okay, it's okay. That wasn't so bad was it?"
0,13,23,SAM,"Well, here we are. This is where you're going to stay for a little while, okay? I know it's nothing fancy but we'll fix it up. Now I have to go somewhere for a little while, but I promise, I won't be gone for long, okay?"
0,13,24,SAM,"No, I have to go, but I will be able to see you the whole time through that camera right there, see? Alright, I'll stay for a little while."
0,13,25,HAMMOND,She seems to have bonded with Captain Carter.
0,13,25,DANIEL,"I can't blame her for being terrified, believe me it was not pretty over there."
0,13,25,HAMMOND,What happened?
0,13,25,JANET,"We counted 1,432 dead. I believe we may be indirectly responsible."
0,13,25,HAMMOND,How?
0,13,25,JANET,"It's possible someone from Earth brought a normally harmless bacteria to that planet, it learned some new traits from a local organism, and mutated into the most deadly infectious strain I've ever encountered."
0,13,25,HAMMOND,Are you absolutely positive you haven't brought any of this disease back here with you?
0,13,25,JANET,"Yes sir, in fact I think we may have brought back the cure."
0,13,25,HAMMOND,Doctor?
0,13,25,JANET,"Sir, somehow this little girl survived against all odds on a completely contaminated planet. Now I'm hoping she has some sort of natural immunity, that we might use in fighting other serious infections already here on Earth."
0,13,25,HAMMOND,Why didn't the telescope team report that this outbreak was going on?
0,13,25,DANIEL,We don't know.
0,13,26,SAM,"Hey, don't you want this?"
0,13,27,SAM,"See, uh, we usually put some stuff on it, like this."
0,13,28,SAM,See.Mmm
0,13,29,SAM,That's me okay? Your not alone anymore.
0,13,30,JACK,This is fun. Only eight hours to go. Sweet.
0,13,30,TEAL'C,I still do not understand this black hole.
0,13,30,JACK,"Well a black hole is this really big thing. It, well basically it's a massive hole, out there."
0,13,30,TEAL'C,I see.
0,13,30,JACK,"What happens is, everything gets sucked into it, even light, that's why we can't see it. Just gets sucked in."
0,13,30,TEAL'C,Thank you.
0,13,30,JACK,Sure.
0,13,31,SAM,"Hey, how are you feeling? Listen, I have to go somewhere for a little while. But your not going to be alone, Daniel's going to be here the whole time. Remember Daniel? You're very brave, remember? I'll be back before you know it."
0,13,31,CASSIE,Please don't go.
0,13,31,SAM,You feel like telling me your name?
0,13,31,CASSIE,Cassandra.
0,13,31,SAM,"Hi, Cassandra."
0,13,31,CASSIE,I hurt.
0,13,31,SAM,Where?
0,13,33,JANET,"Sounds good, no fluid in her lungs."
0,13,33,SAM,She described it as more of a sharp stabbing pain.
0,13,33,JANET,"I have no idea what to say or do. her latest blood work shows a marked potassium efficiency, I have no idea of what is causing it, or how it could have gotten so low, so quickly, but the effect can be arrhythmia."
0,13,33,SAM,Now your sure she doesn't have the disease.
0,13,33,JANET,Positive. These are not the symptoms of a bacterial infection.
0,13,33,SAM,Okay thank you.
0,13,33,JANET,Okay.
0,13,33,SAM,"Alright, let's go back to our room."
0,13,33,CASSIE,Thank you.
0,13,33,JANET,You are welcome.
0,13,34,SAM,"What, what is it?"
0,13,34,JANET,Get her on the table!
0,13,34,SAM,Oh my god!What is it?
0,13,34,JANET,She's got an irregular heartbeat. She's in arrest! Code blue in lab! Code blue!
0,13,34,SAM,What?!? What do I do?
0,13,35,JANET,"I've got a cardiac arrest, potassium defficiency. Get me a number seven cuff and a tracheal tube, now!"
0,13,35,NURSE,Tubes ready! Tubes in!
0,13,35,NURSE,"Defib Stop CPR, Defib, 60 joules."
0,13,35,JANET,"Come on, come on!"
0,13,35,NURSE,Check the monitor.
0,13,35,NURSE,Clear! The nurse puts the paddles on Cassie and shocks her. Her body jumps up. A normal beeping comes from the monitor.
0,13,35,NURSE,"Let me in, let me in."
0,13,35,NURSE,"Check the monitor, check the monitor."
0,13,35,JANET,"I want you to notify the ICU, I wan her potassium levels rechecked, stat! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Go my god!"
0,13,35,SAM,What is it?
0,13,35,JANET,Give me a chest x-ray stat!I don't know listen.
0,13,36,SAM,Oh my God!
0,13,37,HAMMOND,What is it?
0,13,37,JANET,"I don't know, but it wasn't there ten hours ago."
0,13,38,DR WARNER,I'm inserting the scope. Image up.
0,13,38,JANET,Pulse normal.
0,13,38,DR WARNER,I'm advancing the scope. We watch through a monitor as the scope goes through Cassie's body.
0,13,38,JANET,Pulse is rising.
0,13,38,DR WARNER,Adjusting view.
0,13,38,JANET,Well parts of it are defiantly organic.
0,13,38,DR WARNER,"I'm going to move in closer, and try and get a biopsy."
0,13,38,JANET,Pulse is now 140!
0,13,38,DR WARNER,I'm scraping the harder surface for samples.
0,13,38,JANET,We have to stop!
0,13,38,DR WARNER,Just a little more.
0,13,39,DR W,"Removing scope. Prepare the paddles!Charging, clear!"
0,13,39,JANET,Wait! Wait! Pulse is normal.
0,13,40,JANET,"Whatever this object is, it has the ability to stop the heart instantly."
0,13,40,HAMMOND,Can you remove it?
0,13,40,JANET,"Doesn't look like it, not without killing her. Now Dr. Warner managed to get us some samples, I'm hoping the results of the analysis will tell us more about what this object is."
0,13,40,HAMMOND,Thank you doctor.
0,13,41,CASSIE,Mom?
0,13,41,SAM,Hey. You okay?
0,13,41,CASSIE,I was dreaming about my mom.
0,13,41,SAM,You miss your mom very much?
0,13,41,CASSIE,I'm tired.
0,13,41,SAM,"Well then, you should get some rest. Don't worry; everything is going to be just fine. And when you get better, I promise you I am going to show you all kinds of really wonderful things about this planet."
0,13,41,CASSIE,Promise?
0,13,41,SAM,You bet.
0,13,42,DANIEL,How is she?
0,13,42,SAM,"She's fine, sleeping."
0,13,42,DANIEL,"If you want I can sit with her tomorrow, for a few hours."
0,13,42,SAM,"No, we're okay."
0,13,42,DANIEL,Okay.
0,13,42,SAM,"I just, I want to do this."
0,13,42,DANIEL,"Okay, but I guess what I'm saying is, you don't have to do this alone."
0,13,42,SAM,Thanks.
0,13,43,JACK,It's show time.
0,13,43,TEAL'C,The systems are on line.
0,13,44,JACK,The eclipse has reached it's totality.Wow.
0,13,45,SAM,"The layer of fatty tissue between the two objects is decaying. Very slowly mind you, but still."
0,13,45,DANIEL,What's the significance?
0,13,45,SAM,I'm about to do an experiment to find out. One side of the object is made up of iron and potassium. The other is made up of the element that makes up the Stargate.
0,13,45,DANIEL,What?
0,13,45,JANET,"I'm assuming it's the naquada that was in her blood, some how the object is collecting it."
0,13,45,SAM,Now potassium can be one of the most volatile alkali metals on earth. Combined with even a small concentration of naquada and..
0,13,45,DANIEL,Well that doesn't sound very good.
0,13,45,SAM,The room your looking at is in the sub-basement floor of this complex. It's lead sealed. Let's see what happens when we put the two objects together.
0,13,45,DANIEL,Where are the samples?
0,13,45,SAM,I'm only using a microscopic particle of each.
0,13,45,JANET,"The readings off the scale, Gamma and particle radiation."
0,13,45,DANIEL,Are we safe?
0,13,45,SAM,Yeah. But we have a big problem.
0,13,45,DANIEL,Well if two microscopic particle could cause that.
0,13,45,SAM,Then the object inside Cassandra could cause a nuclear reaction a million times bigger.
0,13,47,JACK,What is that?
0,13,47,TEAL'C,A star perhaps.
0,13,47,JACK,"Hit the zoom.No it's way to close to be a star, pull back. What the hell is that?"
0,13,47,TEAL'C,It is a Goa'uld attack vessel.
0,13,48,DANIEL,"It's a set up, it has to be. The Goa'uld wiped out every last living person on that plant except Cassandra. And then they made us think that it was our fault, because they new we wouldn't leave her there, they new we would bring her back here. And they used there technology to put that thing inside of her."
0,13,48,SAM,"It's like they designed away for us to help them create the device, after she came through the Stargate, so we wouldn't detect it until it was to late."
0,13,48,JANET,"We gave her iron supplements, We may have even turned the device on with a jolt of electricity when we resuscitated her."
0,13,48,HAMMOND,You're saying it's might to destroy us.
0,13,48,SAM,"Or at least this complex, the threat to the Goa'uld, the Stargate."
0,13,48,DANIEL,They used that little girl like a Trojan horse.
0,13,48,HAMMOND,How long do we have?
0,13,48,JANET,One hour and 52 minutes.
0,13,48,HAMMOND,You can predict it that actually?
0,13,48,JANET,The cellular decay of the sample Dr. Warner sampled appears to be happening like clockwork.
0,13,49,SAM,How could they do this?
0,13,49,DANIEL,"Well to a Goa'uld, she's not as we see her. She's a tool. Her death is a very cheap way to get rid of us."
0,13,49,SAM,I know I am supposed to be detached.
0,13,49,DANIEL,Who said that?
0,13,49,SAM,Sometimes I forget you're not military.
0,13,50,TEAL'C,It is the ship of the Goa'uld Nirrti. An enemy of Apophis.
0,13,50,JACK,Now what the hell is that?
0,13,50,TEAL'C,We must go.
0,13,51,SAM,"Look sir, I know this decision isn't easy for you."
0,13,51,HAMMOND,In fact the decision is quite easy. The consequence is what's difficult.
0,13,51,SAM,There has to be another way.
0,13,51,HAMMOND,"I have been assured there is absolutely no way to remove the object from the girl without killing her. Therefore we have no choice. According to Dr. Fraiser, measurements of the devices atomic decay, we have one hour and 20 minutes left. The girl should be prepared to go back though the Stargate."
0,13,51,SAM,"I'll take her, sir."
0,13,51,HAMMOND,"Along with SG4, I want O'Neill and Teal'c to return with you."
0,13,52,TEAL'C,We must get to the Stargate!
0,13,52,JACK,No argument from me!
0,13,52,TEAL'C,"This Goa'uld Nirrti, he once sent an emissary of peace, to negotiate a treaty concerning a Stargate, Apophis had taken control of. The negotiations were a ploy, the Stargate was destroyed."
0,13,52,JACK,How?
0,13,52,TEAL'C,"As soon as he entered the Stargate, there was a massive explosion."
0,13,52,JACK,The girl!
0,13,56,DAVIS,Chevron three encoded! Chevron four encoded.
0,13,57,SAM,Cassandra?
0,13,58,JACK,"Take your time, no hurry."
0,13,60,HARRIMAN,Chevron five encoded.
0,13,60,SAM,What is it?
0,13,60,JANET,She's slipped into a coma.
0,13,60,SAM,What?
0,13,60,DAVIS,"Chevron six it, what the hell?"
0,13,60,HAMMOND,Shut the iris.
0,13,60,DAVIS,"No need sir, we're getting an SG1 remote signal."
0,13,61,JACK,Get the girl away from the gate.
0,13,62,JACK,So the Goa'uld kept SG7 from coming back through to warn us. All part of the plan.
0,13,62,DANIEL,So what are we going to do now?
0,13,62,HAMMOND,"Teal'c, Dr. Frasier says this device inside the girl is on some kind of timer. Your sure it will go off if we send the girl through the Stargate?"
0,13,62,TEAL'C,We should not attempt it. The Earth gate is what the Goa'uld wish to destroy.
0,13,62,SAM,Cassandra's conditioned deteriorated when she got near the Stargate.
0,13,62,HAMMOND,Well I can't risk the security of this mountain. Well have the take her someplace else.
0,13,62,JACK,What about the abandoned nuclear facility.
0,13,62,HAMMOND,"Right. It's just 20 minutes away.This is Major General Hammond, get me the Secretary of Defense immediately. Tell him it's a matter of life and death."
0,13,63,JACK,I can take her from here now Captain.
0,13,63,SAM,"No, sir, it's okay."
0,13,63,JACK,This elevator goes down 30 floors through solid rock. It takes about 3 minutes to get to the bottom. That gives you four minutes to start back up.
0,13,64,CASSIE,Where are we going?
0,13,64,SAM,"Please, go back to sleep."
0,13,64,CASSIE,I'm not tired anymore.Are you crying?
0,13,65,SAM,"Sit down here and rest for awhile, okay? I have to go."
0,13,65,CASSIE,You promised you'd never leave me alone.
0,13,65,SAM,"I'll come back, okay? I'll be back.Your very brave, remember?"
0,13,65,CASSIE,I'm very brave.
0,13,65,SAM,I have to close the door.
0,13,66,CASSIE,Sam? Sam?
0,13,67,DANIEL,"Jack, she's going back down."
0,13,67,JACK,The hell she is.Captain Carter?Captain Carter.
0,13,68,JACK,"Sam, do you read me?"
0,13,68,SAM,"Colonel, I'm staying."
0,13,68,JACK,Negative.
0,13,68,SAM,"Colonel, she's awake."
0,13,68,DANIEL,Oh God!
0,13,69,JACK,"Captain, Carter. I am ordering you to get back up here, right now.Right now!"
0,13,70,CASSIE,Are we going to die?
0,13,70,SAM,"No, we're not going to die."
0,13,71,JACK,"Alright, why don't you guys clear out."
0,13,72,JACK,Right
0,13,73,CASSIE,We are both very brave.
0,13,73,SAM,Yeah.
0,13,73,CASSIE,I love you.
0,13,73,SAM,I love you too.
0,13,74,JACK,"Alright, here we go. 9, 8, 7.......1."
0,13,74,DANIEL,I don't feel anything.
0,13,74,JACK,We could have been wrong about the time.
0,13,74,DANIEL,We could have been wrong about what would happen.
0,13,74,JACK,"Captain Carter, can you hear me? Sam, can you here me?'"
0,13,74,SAM,"Were okay, nothing happened. Cassandra's fine, I'm fine, it didn't happen. I just, I couldn't leave her, sir."
0,13,74,JACK,"How did you know, Captain."
0,13,74,SAM,"It occurred to me that she first slipped into the coma when we brought her close to the Stargate. As soon as we got her far enough away from the Stargate, she woke up, and I knew."
0,13,74,JACK,You knew?
0,13,76,DANIEL,Your getting a little heavy for this.
0,13,77,JACK,Cassandra.
0,13,77,SAM,"Hey, there he is."
0,13,77,CASSIE,What's that?
0,13,77,JACK,"We have a rule here on Earth. Every kid has got to have a dog. This is a dog, and he's yours."
0,13,78,DANIEL,"So, how sure were you, really?"
0,13,78,SAM,"I can't explain it Daniel, I just knew."
0,13,78,TEAL'C,"A mothers instinct, perhaps?"
0,13,78,SAM,"Subtle, but no. Dr. Fraiser is going to take her until we find qualified parents."
0,13,78,DANIEL,By qualified you mean ones with the right security clearance.
0,13,78,SAM,"Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if Dr. Fraiser wants to keep her for herself. As long as Cassandra's happy."
0,13,78,TEAL'C,She appears to be.
0,13,78,SAM,I wasn't completely relieved until I knew that the object was shrinking and being reabsorbed by her system.Hey!
0,13,78,CASSIE,Hey Samantha. See my new dog?
0,13,78,SAM,Wow. Your new dog?
0,13,78,CASSIE,"It's an Earth rule, every kid has to have one. But I don't mind."
0,13,78,JACK,"Why don't I take the dog for a little walk.Come here. Teal'c, know anything about dogs?"
0,13,79,TEAL'C,Nothing.
0,13,80,CASSIE,"When you find me a new home, will you come and visit me?"
0,13,80,SAM,"You bet you, all the time."
0,13,80,CASSIE,That is when you're on Earth.
0,13,80,SAM,"Right, now about that Cassandra."
0,13,80,CASSIE,"I know, the Stargate is a secret, and I was born in a place called Toronto?"
0,13,80,SAM,Right.
0,13,80,CASSIE,What are those?
0,13,80,SAM,Those are swings.
0,13,80,CASSIE,We never had any of those in Toronto. They look like fun.
0,13,80,SAM,"They are, come on."
