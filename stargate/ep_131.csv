0,131,1,SHAMDA,"The new animal took a look around and immediately went and chose a place next to the laziest, greediest beast in the stable. When the master saw this, he put a yoke on him at once and took him back to the merchant."
0,131,1,NATIVE,We've heard this one already.
0,131,1,SHAMDA,Has it lost it's meaning?
0,131,1,NATIVE,I mean you told it just now on the way down to the water hole.
0,131,2,NATIVE,Who are you?
0,131,3,DANIEL,I don't know.
0,131,4,JONAS,"I got it. I got it. Teal'c! Teal'c! I got it. I got it. I got it. Oh, sorry, uh, Tyler... Siler...Master Sergeant Siler, Siler. 28, please. It's not the lost city. See, there's a subtle difference in meaning when you use Asgard translations of early Ancient. Remember that. Excuse me. Watch it, watch it. Hey, where's Major Carter?"
0,131,4,DAVIS,"Uh, sh-she's in, uh, Hammond's office."
0,131,5,CARTER,"According to intelligence provided by the Tok'ra, Anubis is quickly decimating the forces of the remaining system lords."
0,131,6,JONAS,I got it.
0,131,6,CARTER,"Hopefully, it's not contagious."
0,131,6,JONAS,"Ha, ha. The lost city... ...on the tablet."
0,131,6,SAM,You found it?
0,131,6,JONAS,"Yeah, only it's not the lost city. That never made sense to me anyway. I mean, t-t-the tablet is written in ancient. How could they lose one of their own cities? And even if they did, why would they call it the lost city? They wouldn't. They would call it by it's name, right?"
0,131,6,HAMMOND,Mr. Quinn...
0,131,6,JONAS,It's not the lost city. It's the city of the lost.
0,131,6,CARTER,Do you have a 'gate address?
0,131,6,JONAS,There's a reference in some partial translations that Dr. Jackson was working on from the library of the four races. It talks about a city of the Ancients called Vis Uban as being a place where the plague began. This was going to be the crown jewel in the entire ancient domain. Only it was still under construction when the plague broke out.
0,131,6,CARTER,Two words...'gate address.
0,131,6,JONAS,"Four years ago, when Colonel O'Neill h-had the ancient repository of knowledge downloaded into his mind, one of the things that he did was to put a bunch of new 'gate addresses into the SGC computer. How many did he put in there?"
0,131,6,CARTER,"Well, we've been sending probes and cataloguing them as fast as we can."
0,131,6,HAMMOND,Any possibly relevant planet goes on the mission list.
0,131,6,JONAS,"Yeah, well how many have actually had probes sent to them?"
0,131,6,CARTER,Less than a quarter.
0,131,6,JONAS,"And do you think that he came up with these, uh, 'gate addresses randomly or could there be some sort of order?"
0,131,6,CARTER,"Yeah, I suppose..."
0,131,6,JONAS,If Vis Uban wasn't finished being built at the time the entire Ancient civilization fell...
0,131,6,CARTER,You're saying the Ancient city we're looking for is the last one on the list.
0,131,6,JONAS,"Well, we've been going in order from first to last, right?"
0,131,6,HAMMOND,Send a probe.
0,131,6,CARTER,"Yes, sir. Sam leaves and Jonas nods at Hammond."
0,131,7,JACK,"We're not talking about a common cold here, Carter. It was the plague."
0,131,7,CARTER,"Sir, we don't wear a Haz-Mat every time we step through the 'gate. There's always a chance we could be exposing ourselves to something dangerous."
0,131,7,JACK,"Well, the place is called the City of the Dead."
0,131,7,JONAS,"The City of the Lost, actually, sir."
0,131,7,JACK,Not for lack of a sense of direction.
0,131,8,JACK,"Well, these folks don't look lost...nor dead."
0,131,8,JONAS,"I don't think that these are the Ancients. I mean, anything's possible, but, uh, they look like some sort of, uh, nomadic tribe that's just taken up residence."
0,131,8,NATIVE,Greetings.
0,131,8,JONAS,Greetings. We're...travelers from a planet called Earth.
0,131,8,NATIVE,You came through the Chappa'ai?
0,131,8,JONAS,The Stargate...Chappa'ai.
0,131,8,NATIVE,He is Jaffa.
0,131,8,JACK,"No, but he plays on T.V."
0,131,8,JONAS,"This is Teal'c. He's no longer allied with the Goa'uld. He's a friend, as are we."
0,131,8,NATIVE,"We too are travelers. This place is not our original home, but...we have been here for some time now. If you wish to lay claim..."
0,131,8,JONAS,"No. No, no, nothing like that. We just want the opportunity to learn more about your people and, uh, take a really good look around these ruins."
0,131,10,NATIVE,They are travelers like us. They say that they are friends.
0,131,10,SHAMDA,No one can be a friend if you know not whether to trust them.
0,131,10,JACK,Don't judge a book by its cover.
0,131,10,SHAMDA,Enemies promises were made to be broken.
0,131,10,JACK,"And yet, honesty is the best policy."
0,131,10,SHAMDA,He that has too many friends has none.
0,131,10,JACK,"Ah, but...birds of a feather..."
0,131,10,SHAMDA,I'm unfamiliar with that story. What lesson does it teach?
0,131,10,JACK,"It has to do with flocking...and togetherness...and...to be honest, I'm not that familiar with the particulars myself. The point is, we're not your enemy. Give us a chance to prove it."
0,131,10,PIERCE,"Colonel, we found something you might want to see."
0,131,11,JACK,Daniel?
0,131,11,NATIVE,Arrom.
0,131,11,JACK,Arrom?
0,131,11,NATIVE,It's what we call him.
0,131,11,SHAMDA,It means naked one.
0,131,11,NATIVE,"That's how we found him in the forest, two moons ago."
0,131,11,PIERCE,Seems he doesn't remember who he is.
0,131,11,CARTER,"Daniel? It's okay. It's me, Sa..."
0,131,11,TEAL'C,"Do you not recognize us, Daniel Jackson?"
0,131,11,DANIEL,I'm sorry. He walks away. They all turn to watch him.
0,131,11,JACK,Not even me?
0,131,12,DANIEL,Please leave me alone.
0,131,12,JACK,"I'm Jack O'Neill. And, barring some freakish similarity, you are Dr. Daniel Jackson."
0,131,12,DANIEL,"This tent is all I know. These people, they're all I know. Before I woke up in the forest, I don't remember anything. I've tried, I've tried to remember who I was before. Sometimes I think it's right there, floating in front of me, and all I have to do is reach out and grab it. I try...and it's gone."
0,131,12,JACK,"You were a member of my team, SG-1. You're a friend of mine. Last year, you died."
0,131,12,DANIEL,I'm dead?
0,131,12,JACK,"Obviously not. You just sort of died. Actually, you...ascended to a higher plain of existence. Last time I saw you, you were helping us fight Anubis."
0,131,12,DANIEL,Anubis?
0,131,12,JACK,"Yeah, kind of an over-the-top, clich√© bad guy. Black cloak, oily skin, kind of spooky. Anyway, obviously since then, you've retaken human form, somehow. I... Actually, I can how this might sound a bit unusual..."
0,131,12,DANIEL,A bit? Why am I here?
0,131,12,JACK,"Hey, why are any of us here? Honestly, I don't know, but you've gotta trust me. You are Daniel Jackson. Think of it this way: out of all the planets in the galaxy, why this one if not for us to find you?"
0,131,12,DANIEL,So you're saying a higher power had a hand in putting me here?
0,131,12,JACK,I don't know. That was generally your department.
0,131,13,CARTER,Thanks very much.
0,131,13,NATIVE,You're welcome.
0,131,14,CARTER,Jonas and Teal'c are helping SG-3 and -5 begin the preliminary sweep.
0,131,14,JACK,Remember when I said it was like talking to a wall?
0,131,14,CARTER,"Sir, we know someone who's ascended can chose to retake human form."
0,131,14,JACK,You think he also chose to forget everything?
0,131,14,CARTER,Maybe the part about his memory isn't voluntary. Who knows? Maybe the whole thing is punishment for trying to help us. He did say he was breaking some pretty big rules.
0,131,14,JACK,So...what?
0,131,14,CARTER,"It's gonna take some time to search the entire extent of the ruins. There could be weapons or a power source hidden just about anywhere. In the mean time, we try to help Daniel remember...if that's even possible."
0,131,14,JACK,Tag...you're it.
0,131,15,CARTER,Can I come in?
0,131,15,DANIEL,Sure.
0,131,15,CARTER,So...
0,131,15,DANIEL,What did you say your name was again?
0,131,15,CARTER,Samantha Carter. You used to call me Sam.
0,131,15,DANIEL,"Yeah, well, like I already told Jim..."
0,131,15,CARTER,"Uh, Jack."
0,131,15,DANIEL,"Jack? Yeah, I told him."
0,131,15,CARTER,I guess what I don't understand is why you aren't dying to know all about who you are.
0,131,15,DANIEL,I am...and I'm not.
0,131,15,CARTER,"See, it's the not part..."
0,131,15,DANIEL,What if I don't like who I was? What if I don't want to be that person? What if I don't have it in me to make up for something I've done wrong?
0,131,15,CARTER,"I have to admit, that never occurred to me. Look, we all thought we'd lost you at one point. It was one of the hardest things I have ever been through. You were...you are...brilliant. One of the most caring, passionate...you're the type of person who would give his own life for someone he doesn't even know."
0,131,15,DANIEL,"Well, that doesn't sound so bad."
0,131,15,CARTER,"If you had one fault, it was that you wanted to save people so badly, y-you wanted to help people so much, that it tore you apart when you couldn't make a difference."
0,131,15,DANIEL,That actually sounds kind of hard to live up to.
0,131,15,CARTER,"All I know is that if I were you, I would definitely want to get to know me...you."
0,131,15,DANIEL,I get it.
0,131,15,CARTER,Come back with us. Let us show you who you are instead of just telling you.
0,131,15,DANIEL,I'll think about it.
0,131,15,CARTER,Okay. She gets up to leave.
0,131,15,DANIEL,Samantha Carter? Sam stops at the tent entrance and turns back to Daniel.
0,131,15,CARTER,Yeah?
0,131,15,DANIEL,Was there ever anything...between us?
0,131,15,CARTER,"Us, uh...no, no, not in that way. We - we were really, really good friends."
0,131,15,DANIEL,Okay. Sam leaves the tent and joins up with O'Neill and Shamda in the village square.
0,131,15,JACK,Carter...Shamda here was just telling me a story about...a dog and some dancing monkeys.
0,131,15,SHAMDA,The moral of which is appearances can be deceptive.
0,131,15,JACK,"I got that. Very good story, wonderful. Full of nuances, I like that."
0,131,16,JONAS,"We, uh, we sent up a UAV."
0,131,16,TEAL'C,The ruins are quite extensive.
0,131,16,JONAS,"Yeah, it's gonna take us weeks to scour this place properly."
0,131,16,TEAL'C,What of Daniel Jackson?
0,131,16,DANIEL,He's going home.
0,131,17,HAMMOND,"Welcome back, Dr. Jackson."
0,131,17,DANIEL,Thank you. Thank you very much. He looks around the 'gate room as though he's never seen it before.
0,131,17,HAMMOND,You have no memory of who I am?
0,131,17,DANIEL,None whatsoever.
0,131,17,JACK,"Neither do I, sir. Uh, that way. Did I mention you owe me 50 bucks?"
0,131,18,JANET,"Well, I'm happy to say, sir, that he's in perfect health, except for one small exception..."
0,131,18,DANIEL,"Wow, that's different."
0,131,18,JACK,You recognize me now?
0,131,18,DANIEL,Has your hair always been that way?
0,131,18,JACK,What way?
0,131,18,DANIEL,Never mind.
0,131,19,JACK,"Not exactly home, but...we unpacked some of your stuff."
0,131,19,DANIEL,You kept all this even though you thought I was dead?
0,131,19,JACK,"To be honest, we tossed out a ton of junk. A lot of which seemed to be very valuable."
0,131,20,JACK,I...kept a few of your...personal things alive there.
0,131,21,DANIEL,I know her.
0,131,21,JACK,Really?
0,131,21,DANIEL,"I mean, I must, right?"
0,131,21,JACK,Yeah...
0,131,21,DANIEL,Who is she? What's her name?
0,131,21,JACK,You tell me.
0,131,22,DANIEL,"Oh, sorry. Am I interrupting?"
0,131,22,TEAL'C,You are not. I am unable to Kel-no-reem as I once did since I began using Tretonin.
0,131,22,DANIEL,"Well, that sounds complicated."
0,131,22,TEAL'C,Indeed. Enter. Daniel walks in and takes a seat as Teal'c rises and sits on his bed. Daniel holds up the photo of Sha're so that Teal'c can see it.
0,131,22,DANIEL,Her name is Sha're.
0,131,22,TEAL'C,Yes.
0,131,22,DANIEL,"No one told me that. I remembered that by myself. I dreamed about her and when I woke up, I knew her name."
0,131,22,TEAL'C,"That is good news, Daniel Jackson."
0,131,22,DANIEL,"Yeah, it's the first time I've believed I might have a chance. You know? If I can remember a name, then...there's a chance it's all in there somewhere, right?"
0,131,22,TEAL'C,Indeed.
0,131,22,DANIEL,"So...so where is she? She's dead. I loved her very much. This being, Oma Desala, is supposedly very powerful, right?"
0,131,22,TEAL'C,That is correct.
0,131,22,DANIEL,"Why would she do this? I mean, if she wanted me to forget..."
0,131,22,TEAL'C,"You often spoke of the rules to which you were subjugated as one of the Ascended. Perhaps she was required to erase your memories by laws of the Others, but as your friend and mentor, she wished you one day to regain it."
0,131,22,DANIEL,You think she cheated? You think she found a way around the rules?
0,131,22,TEAL'C,You do not agree?
0,131,22,DANIEL,Tell me about this Anubis. Why did I break the rules to fight him?
0,131,22,TEAL'C,Do you not believe it wise to remember on your own accord?
0,131,22,DANIEL,No. I need to know why this is happening to me.
0,131,24,JONAS,"At this point, uh, we believe that we've mapped the full extent of the ruins."
0,131,24,JACK,No...fancy guns or anything cool?
0,131,24,JONAS,"Well, we've only completed a preliminary investigation... Daniel and another descend into the Briefing Room ."
0,131,24,DANIEL,"I'm sorry I'm late I, uh, forgot what time the meeting was... It's a little joke there. It's the memory thing..."
0,131,24,HAMMOND,"Dr. Jackson, this briefing is classified."
0,131,24,DANIEL,"Yeah, Jonas mentioned that, but, uh, you all said that I used to be a part of this, so...look, I can't really give you a good reason, I just...feel like I should be here."
0,131,24,HAMMOND,Good enough. Daniel walks over and takes a seat next to Sam at the table.
0,131,24,DANIEL,"Beside, who am I gonna tell? I mean, I don't, uh, I don't remember anybody, right?"
0,131,24,JACK,Good one.
0,131,24,DANIEL,"Thanks, Jim."
0,131,24,JONAS,"Oh, so, uh...there are extensive writings. All of them are in the oldest known Ancient dialects. All of them have yet to be translated, but, uh, so far, we haven't found any signs of any advanced weapons or power sources. I mean, the original name of the city is Vis Uban which does translate as place of great power, but there's no indication that we're gonna find any means of defeating Anubis there."
0,131,24,DANIEL,You're not. It's not the lost city.
0,131,24,JACK,How do you know?
0,131,24,DANIEL,"Uh, because Jonas translated Lacun to mean of the lost."
0,131,24,JONAS,"Yeah, but that's how we found..."
0,131,24,DANIEL,the wrong place.
0,131,24,JONAS,The translations in your notes...
0,131,24,DANIEL,also wrong...if these are the ones you mean. I was...way off.
0,131,24,JONAS,"Well, how do you know that?"
0,131,24,DANIEL,I don't know? I-I just...I know what the tablet says.
0,131,24,JACK,How?
0,131,24,DANIEL,I don't know? I just looked at it and understood it.
0,131,24,CARTER,Wait a minute...are you saying the Ancients actually lost one of their own cities?
0,131,24,DANIEL,"No, no...they didn't lose it. They - they made it lost...to other people that might try to find it. I'm guessing that they camouflaged it...and removed all reference to it from the written history."
0,131,24,JACK,So...the lost city is...still lost?
0,131,24,DANIEL,I'm pretty sure.
0,131,24,JACK,"You know, you told me to give Anubis that eye."
0,131,24,CARTER,"According to reports from our allies, Anubis is quickly conquering the other system lords."
0,131,24,TEAL'C,He will dominate the galaxy in a very short time.
0,131,24,JACK,I only did it because you said we could whup his ass with what we find in this lost city.
0,131,24,DANIEL,"Wa-if I said that, then I-I hope it's...true, but...but all I know is that the place you're searching right now is not it."
0,131,24,JACK,Then...where is it?
0,131,24,DANIEL,Did I just say all I know?
0,131,24,JACK,Everyone turn away. I want no witnesses.
0,131,25,DANIEL,Yeah. Hey.
0,131,25,JONAS,Sorry to bother you...
0,131,25,DANIEL,"No...no you're not, I was just, uh...uh, reading about us, actually."
0,131,25,JONAS,"You said that Anubis was part-Ascended. That the Ancients tried to send him back to our level of existence, but failed, and now he's trapped somewhere in between."
0,131,25,DANIEL,"Yeah, so I've heard."
0,131,25,JONAS,"Anubis wouldn't know know everything there is to know about the Ancients, then, right? Otherwise, he would have already found the lost city..."
0,131,25,DANIEL,"Look, I know I was able to read that tablet..."
0,131,25,JONAS,"I-I'm just thinking out loud here...If Anubis were to accidently find the tablet, chances are that he's not gonna make the same mistake I did."
0,131,25,DANIEL,I don't know.
0,131,25,JONAS,"But if we were to make a replica of the tablet...You know, change what it says..."
0,131,25,DANIEL,Why?
0,131,27,CARTER,"As you all know, we've had little success using Naquadria to power the F-302's hyperspace generator for any length of time. However, if our calculations are correct, we believe that a short, controlled burst would send the 302 into subspace just long enough to bypass the mother ship's shields."
0,131,27,JACK,And if your calculations are incorrect?
0,131,27,CARTER,"The 302 would bypass the mother ship all together, or worse, re-emerge inside it, but let's not go there right now."
0,131,27,JACK,"Of course, let's not dwell."
0,131,27,CARTER,"Now, uh, uh, according to intelligence provided by the Tok'ra, the power core of Anubis' new weapon must be cooled by a ventilation shaft on the exterior of the ship. If that can be targeted and destroyed just as the weapon is powering up, the crystals will over heat and be destroyed."
0,131,27,JACK,"Where is the shaft, exactly?"
0,131,27,CARTER,"As Colonel O'Neill is well aware, we don't know exactly where the shaft is"
0,131,27,TOK'RA FEMALE,"Our operative in Anubis' ranks has been unable to get aboard the new ship, and has only been able to glean a very limited working knowledge of it. Anubis protects his computer systems with elaborate ciphers coded in the oldest known Ancient dialect. We have been unable to translate them."
0,131,27,CARTER,Which is where Jonas Quinn and Daniel Jackson come in. They'll sneak onto Anubis' ship and access the computer.
0,131,27,TOK'RA FEMALE,"We have devised an injectable radioactive isotope that will allow them to move freely on Anubis' ship, undetected by i's sensors, for eight hours."
0,131,27,CARTER,"They'll decipher the codes and relay the location of the target to Colonel O'Neill and myself, who will be flying the F-302."
0,131,27,JACK,"No problem, right?"
0,131,27,JONAS,"Hey, sounds easy to me. Daniel gives a thumb-up."
0,131,27,JACK,Good. Anubis' ship is destroyed and we all live to save another day.
0,131,27,CARTER,"Again, as the Colonel is well aware, we have reason to believe that eliminating the crystal power core of the ship's main weapon won't destroy the entire ship. It's defenses and auxiliary weapons will remain intact."
0,131,27,JACK,Why don't we dwell on that for just a minute?
0,131,27,CARTER,"Our goal is to take out Anubis' new super weapon. It's what gives him a clear advantage over the rest of the Goa'uld mother ships. Now, we've received word from Teal'c that Yu has pledged to bring the full force of the remaining system lords' fleet down on Anubis once we've succeeded."
0,131,27,JACK,"Okay. Everyone who thinks this is absolutely an insane idea, raise your hand. Come on, be honest."
0,131,27,HAMMOND,"Keep your hands up, people, because the next question is who is going to make this happen?"
0,131,27,JONAS,"Well, uh, it's going to take us at least a week to relocate the inhabitants of the ruins..."
0,131,27,CARTER,Which will give us more than enough time to build a makeshift runway and get the 302 through the 'gate and reassembled.
0,131,27,JONAS,"Once everything is established. The Tok'ra will plant our fake tablet and, with any luck, we'll lure Anubis to the planet."
0,131,27,HAMMOND,"Let's move. Those in the room begin to depart, leaving Sam, Jack, Jonas and Daniel alone in the room."
0,131,27,JACK,"Look, I realize I wasn't the most positive voice in the room..."
0,131,27,CARTER,"We all know it's an extreme long-shot, sir."
0,131,27,JACK,"Well, my big problem with it is that all this depends on us trusting a Goa'uld to back us up."
0,131,27,CARTER,This is our only chance to take Anubis completely out of the picture and Yu has come through for us in the past.
0,131,27,JACK,All I'm saying...just for the record...this is the wackiest plan we've ever come up with.
0,131,27,CARTER,Wackier than strapping an active Stargate to the bottom of the X-302?
0,131,27,JACK,"Oh, yeah."
0,131,27,CARTER,Wackier than-than blowing up a sun?
0,131,27,JACK,Yep!
0,131,27,CARTER,He's probably right.
0,131,28,YU'S FIRST PRIME,"My Lord, the fleet is ready."
0,131,28,YU,I say when the fleet is ready.
0,131,28,YFP,"Of, course, my Lord. It is time we move them in to position to prepare for the ambush of Anubis...as you agreed, my Lord."
0,131,28,YU,Speak to me as if I am a fool again and you will not take another breath.
0,131,28,YFP,"Yes, my Lord. Yu climbs into the sarcophagus."
0,131,28,YU,Move the fleet into position. The sarcophagus closes.
0,131,29,DANIEL,That's your son.
0,131,29,JACK,Yeah.
0,131,29,DANIEL,Charlie...he's why I know you. You took that first mission to Abydos because you thought it'd be...suicide.
0,131,29,JACK,Things change.
0,131,29,DANIEL,"Yeah, sorry."
0,131,29,JACK,You sure you're ready for this?
0,131,29,DANIEL,"Yeah, well, despite what you say...I don't think you'd be doing this if it wasn't worth doing."
0,131,29,JACK,"Well, you obviously don't remember everything. You never used to follow my lead."
0,131,29,DANIEL,"I didn't? Hey, um, I may not remember everything, but, uh...I remember enough."
0,131,29,JACK,Good.
0,131,30,CARTER,"Sir, welcome to base camp."
0,131,30,HAMMOND,"Thank you, Major."
0,131,30,CARTER,"I have to admit, it's a little strange to see you off-world."
0,131,30,HAMMOND,"Well, this is not your usual, run of the mill, alien planet operation, is it, Major?"
0,131,30,CARTER,"No, sir."
0,131,30,HAMMOND,What's our status?
0,131,30,CARTER,"We're ready to go, sir."
0,131,30,HAMMOND,"You'd better get yourself out to the F-302, then."
0,131,30,CARTER,"Yes, sir. He returns the salute and she leaves."
0,131,31,YFP,We have just received word that Abubis' ship will be arriving in the system momentarily. Teal'c bows slightly.
0,131,32,DAVIS,"Airstrike, this is command base. You are a go for take off."
0,131,32,JACK,"Yeah, I thought we were going with Red Leader on this one."
0,131,32,CARTER,"All systems go, sir."
0,131,32,JACK,"Uh, command? There is one more thing..."
0,131,32,HAMMOND,Colonel...Major...Godspeed.
0,131,32,JACK,All right...that's better.
0,131,32,CARTER,"Thank you, sir. We see the F-302 fire up, taxi down the run way and zip off into space."
0,131,33,JONAS,"Thanks, guys."
0,131,33,PIERCE,Good luck.
0,131,35,JACK,Holy crap! Look at that thing. It's huge.
0,131,35,CARTER,"I think they know we're coming, sir. Tally four gliders, nose, 400 kilometers. We see four blips on Sam's radar screen."
0,131,37,JACK,Extending...max burn.
0,131,37,CARTER,"You're heading right for them, sir."
0,131,37,JACK,I wanna see what this thing's made of.
0,131,37,CARTER,"I could tell you exactly, sir."
0,131,37,JACK,"Another time, maybe...please. Fox 4, 2. Pitching back, left, 1, 3, 5. The F-302 does a loop to avoid glider fire."
0,131,37,CARTER,"Daniel, Jonas, we are under attack. We need that intel."
0,131,37,DANIEL,We're close.
0,131,37,CARTER,We can't hold these guys off for long.
0,131,38,JONAS,Great...we got company. He heads back to the door controls to try and ensure that it stays closed.
0,131,39,YFP,My Lord.
0,131,39,YU,Take the fleet to Chodawa.
0,131,39,YFP,"My Lord, that is across the galaxy. We are in position to ambush Anubis according to the..."
0,131,39,YU,Do not question me! I am your God! Do as I say! The transmission ends.
0,131,39,TEAL'C,You cannot.
0,131,39,YFP,I have no choice. Take him to a holding cell.
0,131,39,TEAL'C,"If you abandon this opportunity to eliminate Anubis, you are dooming yourself and your master as well."
0,131,39,YFP,I must do as my God commands.
0,131,40,HERAK,"My Lord, our ground troops have confirmed that there is a human base on the planet."
0,131,40,ANUBIS,The search of the city?
0,131,40,HERAK,No energy signatures.
0,131,41,JONAS,All right...that'll hold 'em off for...a while...a little while.
0,131,41,DANIEL,That's it...I'm in. Uh...this may take longer than a little while.
0,131,41,JONAS,"Well, can't you do some kind of a...keyword search?"
0,131,41,DANIEL,Yeah? For what? Achilles?
0,131,41,JONAS,"Well, that's good. I'm glad to see that your...your memory's finally coming back. Not to mention your razor-sharp wit, but why don't we try something like, uh...uh, power core venting? That' it, that's it."
0,131,41,DANIEL,"Jack, Sam, we got it. Transmitting data..."
0,131,42,JACK,"We gotta go, Carter."
0,131,42,CARTER,"Sir, I've got the target data, but we need Anubis to power the weapon."
0,131,42,HAMMOND,"Airborne, we have not heard from Teal'c. The Goa'uld fleet is long overdue."
0,131,42,JACK,Gee...I had a problem with this plan...
0,131,42,ON ANUBIS' SHIP,
0,131,42,ANUBIS,Send in another squadron.
0,131,42,HERAK,I do not believe what you are searching for is here.
0,131,42,ANUBIS,I agree.
0,131,42,HERAK,"Shall I target their base, my Lord?"
0,131,42,ANUBIS,No. Recall the ground troops.
0,131,42,HERAK,"Yes, my Lord."
0,131,42,JONAS,I don't think that we're going to get back to the ring room that way.
0,131,42,DANIEL,What's that?
0,131,42,JONAS,"They're targeting the planet. Base camp, this is Jonas, come in."
0,131,42,DAVIS,Go ahead.
0,131,42,JONAS,"Your position's been compromised. The Stargate is being targeted. Repeat, the Stargate is being targeted. The naquadah will amplify the blast."
0,131,42,HAMMOND,Roger that. Evacuate all personnel.
0,131,42,AND BACK IN THE 302,
0,131,42,CARTER,"We need the Goa'uld mother ships here to finish the job. Sir, we've got four more gliders headed this way."
0,131,42,JACK,Can we go at it now?
0,131,42,CARTER,Activating hyper-drive.
0,131,42,JACK,Extending straight up. The new view out the 302 cockpit is reminiscent of the view Luke Skywalker had when he zipped the trench on the first Death Star in his X-wing. Jack manages to avoid all ship outcroppings and get the 302 under control.
0,131,42,JACK,Damn...that was close.
0,131,42,CARTER,"Transferring target data to your terminal, sir."
0,131,42,ON THE MOTHERSHIP,
0,131,42,JONAS,Yeah. They pick up their zats and head to a ventilation shaft. The door is beginning to yield.
0,131,42,DANIEL,Here.
0,131,42,JONAS,"Go, come on. Daniel climbs up into the shaft just as the Jaffa break through. Daniel makes it out, Jonas does not."
0,131,43,JACK,"Target is locked. Fox 4, 2. He fires missiles at the target. We see an explosion on the ship."
0,131,43,CARTER,"Nice shot, sir."
0,131,43,JACK,"Well, thank you, Ma'am."
0,131,43,ON THE SHIP,
0,131,45,CARTER,"Daniel, come in. Do you read?"
0,131,45,DANIEL,"Yeah, I'm still on the ship. Hey congratulations, I think you guys hit the mark."
0,131,45,JACK,"Thanks, it was fun."
0,131,45,CARTER,We'll wait until Anubis' ship clears out and rendezvous with you at the Stargate as planned.
0,131,45,DANIEL,"Yeah, as far as that goes, we may have a little problem."
0,131,46,ANUBIS,You will suffer gravely.
0,131,46,JONAS,"Yeah, I figured as much. Although, I am consoled by the fact that we succeeded in destroying the power source for your new weapon."
0,131,46,ANUBIS,You are in no position to gloat.
0,131,46,JONAS,We just wiped out your single advantage you had over the Goa'uld. I would say that that's...about as good a reason as any.
0,131,46,ANUBIS,Enough.
0,131,46,JONAS,I won't tell you anything.
0,131,46,ANUBIS,Oh...yes...you...will. Anubis pulls out a small spikey device and holds it in his hand so Jonas can see. Jonas looks a bit disturbed.
