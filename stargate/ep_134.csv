0,134,0,"""ORPHEUS""",By Peter DeLuise
0,134,1,DAVIS,Unscheduled off-world activation.
0,134,2,DAVIS,"It's SG-1's IDC, Sir. Hammond comes up behind him. Receiving audio, Sir."
0,134,2,HAMMOND,On speaker.
0,134,2,O'NEILL,Close quarters withdrawal! It's gonna get ugly!
0,134,2,HAMMOND,"Acknowledged, Colonel. We'll be ready, just give us the word. Then to those standing guard in the 'gate room: Watch your friendlies, safeties off, clean targets, clean backgrounds."
0,134,3,O'NEILL,"Teal'c! Let's go! Base, this is it! We're on our way!"
0,134,3,HAMMOND,Open the iris.
0,134,4,CARTER,Teal'c's right behind us!
0,134,5,HAMMOND,Med team! Get in there!
0,134,6,FRAISER,Teal'c? She leans her ear to his mouth to hear if he is breathing. Then turns to one of her assistants: Come on.
0,134,6,FRAISER,Start CPR. Give me one milligram Epi. Prepare to intubate.
0,134,8,FRAISER,You had us all very worried.
0,134,8,TEAL'C,That was not my intention.
0,134,8,FRAISER,The staff blast hit you directly in the symbiote pouch. If you weren't on Tretonin..
0,134,8,TEAL'C,I would be dead. Ironic.
0,134,8,FRAISER,"Well, you're not out of the woods yet."
0,134,8,TEAL'C,Woods?
0,134,8,FRAISER,"You have more healing to do. The staff blast passed through the empty symbiote pouch and did some damage to your spine and surrounding soft tissue. In the past, I could have let your symbiote regenerate the damage. With work, you should be able to make a full recovery. Teal'c?"
0,134,8,TEAL'C,The Jaffa that wounded me...
0,134,8,FRAISER,"Died. His symbiote was damaged beyond repair. Look, I know this is hard for you, but you're very lucky to be alive."
0,134,9,CARTER,Colonel O'Neill planted my radio in the underbrush away from our position and began broadcasting to create a distraction. The Jaffa fell for this diversion and half of them left the temple. We engaged the rest and escaped.
0,134,9,HAMMOND,Were you able to ascertain who these Jaffa were loyal to?
0,134,9,JACKSON,"The forehead tattoos were that of various system lords, but the majority wore the symbol of Ba'al."
0,134,9,HAMMOND,Ba'al?
0,134,9,JACKSON,His empire has expanded further and faster than anyone could have expected. Which shouldn't be a surprise to us since he now controls the combined forces of the United Alliance of the System Lords. Something we're responsible for.
0,134,9,HAMMOND,To level the playing field against Anubis.
0,134,9,JACKSON,"So, in a way, we did it to ourselves."
0,134,10,FRAISER,Sir...
0,134,10,HAMMOND,How is he?
0,134,10,FRAISER,"It's gonna be a long road back...certainly longer than Teal'c is used to, but he should get there. I've boosted his Tretonin dosage to stem off any residual infection."
0,134,10,CARTER,Can we see him?
0,134,10,FRAISER,Yeah.
0,134,12,TEAL'C,My son? Why do you ask?
0,134,12,JACKSON,"Oh, I don't know, I just thought you'd be sick of how you feeling again."
0,134,12,TEAL'C,Indeed.
0,134,12,JACKSON,"No, I was just thinkin' about him recently."
0,134,12,TEAL'C,Ry'ac is with Bra'tac. They are attempting to recruit rebel Jaffa. I have not heard from them and do not expect to for some time.
0,134,12,JACKSON,What's with the uh... We see the four cups on the bedside tray. Three are empty and the fourth is still full of green jello.
0,134,12,TEAL'C,O'Neill. I believe his offering of colored gelatin was his attempt to sympathize.
0,134,12,JACKSON,"Ah, well, he's thoughtful that way."
0,134,12,TEAL'C,There's no need. I blame only myself.
0,134,12,JACKSON,How is it your fault?
0,134,12,TEAL'C,I fell behind. I was...
0,134,12,JACKSON,Covering us. Teal'c?
0,134,12,TEAL'C,"I wish to be alone, Daniel Jackson."
0,134,13,JACKSON,"Okay. He gets up off the stool he's been sitting on. Okay. He walks out the door. As he is entering the hallway outside the infirmary, he hears a voice say No, Master!. He looks around, but sees no one. He looks back toward Teal'c and then shakes his head, not quite sure what to think about the voice he heard."
0,134,14,CARTER,"So they fly half-way across the galaxy in an highly advanced spaceship, but they don't use their technology to take over the planet. You know what their weakness turned out to be? Water. I mean, if that's true, why go to all the trouble to invade a planet that's two-thirds water? Not to mention the rain."
0,134,14,JACKSON,Why do you watch those movies if all you're gonna do is cut 'em up?
0,134,14,CARTER,"Come on, don't you occasionally like to see if they're getting it anywhere close to right? Daniel does not respond right away, but rather stares off into space. Hello?"
0,134,14,JACKSON,What?
0,134,14,CARTER,You okay?
0,134,14,JACKSON,Ever feel like you've forgotten something really important?
0,134,15,JACKSON,"Well, I can remember almost everything from before I died, but uh, I still can't remember anything from when I was ascended. Lately, something's been nagging at me, I guess. Something specific, I just can't pin it down."
0,134,16,THERAPIST,"Very good, Teal'c. Okay, you're done. Teal'c doesn't stop. Instead, he turns around and prepares to go back the way he just came. Teal'c..."
0,134,17,CARTER,Look's like you're doing better.
0,134,17,JACKSON,"You know, there is such a thing as over doing it."
0,134,18,CARTER,"Yeah, Teal'c, it is possible to aggravate your condition by pushing too hard."
0,134,19,TEAL'C,Leave me be.
0,134,19,CARTER,Daniel?
0,134,20,CARTER,Any technical anomalies during an incoming wormhole are noted in this box and then cross-referenced and detailed here. It's pretty dry. The corresponding mission files cover any general points of interest.
0,134,20,JACKSON,"Yeah, I've been over those."
0,134,20,CARTER,"Well, if I knew what you were looking for..."
0,134,20,JACKSON,You wouldn't be doing this.
0,134,20,CARTER,What makes you think the answer's here?
0,134,20,JACKSON,I just have this feeling it has something to do with an incoming wormhole. I was hoping that looking at some of this stuff might jog my memory somehow. CARTER: It must be tough.
0,134,20,JACKSON,"I think the hardest part is not knowing whether or not I...chose to be here like this. You know, whether I could...be doing more good if I was still..."
0,134,20,CARTER,Ascended?
0,134,20,JACKSON,Yeah.
0,134,20,CARTER,"Well, this should be everything you need. Good luck."
0,134,20,JACKSON,Thanks.
0,134,22,FRAISER,"Well, that's the last of the physical examination. You have just lifted, pushed and pulled more weight than anyone on this base ever has, alien technology not withstanding. Teal'c gets up and goes to another machine. Teal'c... Janet looks a little concerned. I'm clearing you for active duty."
0,134,22,TEAL'C,I am not ready.
0,134,23,O'NEILL,Still nothing?
0,134,23,JACKSON,"Well, I've broadened my search to any 'gate activity, including outgoing wormholes and unauthorized activations. I still have no idea what I'm looking for."
0,134,23,O'NEILL,"Maybe if you stop thinkin' about it, it'll come to you. Daniel looks quizzically at Jack, Jack shrugs. Take a break. Fraiser says Teal'c needs a little pep talk. I've been practicing in front of a mirror for an hour."
0,134,23,JACKSON,Not peppy enough?
0,134,23,O'NEILL,Not really. Daniel nods and gets up.
0,134,24,O'NEILL,Don't give me the eyebrow.
0,134,24,JACKSON,"Look, Teal'c, something's bothering you. Something's been bothering you since before this injury. We're pretty sure we know what it is."
0,134,24,TEAL'C,Then there is no mystery.
0,134,24,JACKSON,"Yeah, but the point is you have to talk about it. Teal'c gives him a stare. Okay, you don't have to talk about it, but...you'll feel better if you do."
0,134,25,O'NEILL,"You know, forget that crap...I'm you're commanding officer..."
0,134,25,TEAL'C,And you must be kept informed of the fitness of all those under your command.
0,134,25,O'NEILL,Frasier says you're ready for duty now. Is that true?
0,134,25,TEAL'C,I have been dishonest with you.
0,134,25,O'NEILL,Oh?
0,134,25,TEAL'C,It is unacceptable. All Jaffa children know this without being told. They are born with the knowledge. It will not be tolerated.
0,134,25,O'NEILL,What?
0,134,25,TEAL'C,Kek.
0,134,26,JACKSON,Death. Death? You mean death?
0,134,26,TEAL'C,"Weakness. We use one word for both, for if one is weak, one may as well be dead."
0,134,26,JACKSON,You're talkin' about the Tretonin.
0,134,26,TEAL'C,"In the beginning I believed it to be the answer of liberation for all Jaffa from the Goa'uld and the reliance on symbiotes. But as soon as I began to take it, things changed. I felt my capability was being compromised, but I said nothing, hoping the effects were only temporary and my strength would return. It did not."
0,134,26,O'NEILL,Okay...
0,134,26,TEAL'C,"Forgive me, O'Neill, I should have..."
0,134,26,O'NEILL,No. There's nothing to forgive. You're still...twice as strong as I'll ever be and you've got two good knees...
0,134,26,TEAL'C,Then the answer to your question is no. I do not feel that I am fit for duty.
0,134,26,O'NEILL,Okay...I can accept that...for now.
0,134,27,JACKSON,"Yeah, you're right...not exactly peppy."
0,134,27,O'NEILL,"Oh, what'd you want me to say to the guy?"
0,134,27,JACKSON,"Well, he's lost his confidence. I think he was looking for you to re-instill some."
0,134,27,O'NEILL,"Well, if he really has lost his mojo, there's nothing I can say that's gonna get it back for him."
0,134,27,JACKSON,It's all in his head.
0,134,27,O'NEILL,"If he doesn't think he's ready, he's not ready."
0,134,29,TEAL'C,"Without a symbiote, Kelnoreem is unnecessary. In fact, I have discontinued the practice. Teal'c is sitting on the floor leaning up against a piece of furniture. Daniel has just finished lighting a candle and has joined Teal'c on the floor."
0,134,29,JACKSON,"Yeah, I know you don't actually need to Kelnoreem anymore, but, uh...just indulge me. See, humans sometimes meditate even thought they still require REM sleep, and I really think this thing I can't remember..."
0,134,29,TEAL'C,"Daniel Jackson...for a successful Kelnoreem, there is one element required above all others..."
0,134,29,JACKSON,What?
0,134,29,TEAL'C,Silence.
0,134,29,JACKSON,Right.
0,134,29,WHJ,Kree hasshak.
0,134,30,BRA'TAC,Leave him alone.
0,134,31,TEAL'C,Ry'ac?
0,134,31,JACKSON,"Yeah...Yeah, I saw him and Bra'tac. I think they're in danger."
0,134,31,TEAL'C,Are you familiar with the ambush of Kresh'taa?
0,134,31,JACKSON,"Uh...yeah, the meeting of the Jaffa rebel tribes. I read the report. 106 warriors slaughtered. Only you and Bra'tac survived. You sustained both of your lived by...passing a symbiote between the two of you."
0,134,31,TEAL'C,"There is something that is not in the report. As I lay near death, I began to dream. You used your abilities and appeared to me in that dream."
0,134,31,JACKSON,I did?
0,134,31,TEAL'C,"Indeed. When I had sufficiently recovered, you appeared to me again. And that is when I knew. You had stayed with me and watched over me for three days. And that is the reason I am eternally grateful to you, Daniel Jackson, and why I whole- heartedly believe you concerning Ry'ac."
0,134,32,JACKSON,"So, you believe me too?"
0,134,32,HAMMOND,The things I've heard sitting in this chair...
0,134,32,CARTER,"If this happened before you retook human form, then, whatever supply of Tretonin Bra'tac had would almost surely be depleted by now."
0,134,32,TEAL'C,That is why we must act immediately.
0,134,32,CARTER,"Daniel, you said you thought all this had to so with 'gate records. Perhaps you innately knew to look for a location?"
0,134,32,JACKSON,I've been through those records upside down and backwards. I still haven't found anything.
0,134,32,CARTER,"Teal'c, is there anything familiar about the planet Daniel described?"
0,134,32,TEAL'C,"There is not. General Hammond, I request that we send for Rak'nor immediately."
0,134,32,HAMMOND,Do it.
0,134,32,CARTER,"Yes, Sir."
0,134,33,RY'AC,You grow more and more weak each day.
0,134,33,BRA'TAC,"You worry to much for me, Ry'ac. Tend to your own labor."
0,134,34,WHJ,A kek hasshak. Ya duru!
0,134,35,WHJ,If you do not work...you will die. They do not work hard enough.
0,134,35,RY'AC,"No rescue is forthcoming, and you're supply of Tretonin runs low..."
0,134,35,BRA'TAC,Ry'ac...
0,134,35,WHJ,Kreeka! We see the four executioners lift their staffs as the four laborers await their fate.
0,134,35,RY'AC,We will not be able to maintain our workload. They will execute us next.
0,134,35,WHJ,Kree!
0,134,36,WHJ,". The Jaffa who had been ready to shoot the runner, throws his staff to the White- Haired Jaffa. WHJ shoots the runner in the back."
0,134,36,BRA'TAC,"Have faith. I will ration my Tretonin, until a rescue."
0,134,37,WHJ,Kek.
0,134,38,WHJ,Shaaaaal vak!
0,134,40,JACKSON,"Is any of this familiar to you? A planet with two moons, a naquadah refinery near some sort of anti-gravity dry-dock with a mother ship under construction?"
0,134,40,RAK'NOR,I know the planet of which you describe...Erebus.
0,134,40,JACKSON,"According to Greek mythology, Erebus is a place where condemned souls pass as soon as they die."
0,134,40,RAK'NOR,"Then it is aptly named. The planet is used for the construction of Ha'tak vessels and the purification of the Naquadah to build them. Only Jaffa prisoner labor is used, as only they can withstand the intense heat and toxic gases of the blast furnaces fed by underground volcanic systems. Eventually, even the Jaffa succumb."
0,134,40,TEAL'C,"I am aware of such places, where Jaffa prisoners of war, unwilling to serve their new Goa'uld masters, are taken to be worked to death."
0,134,40,JACKSON,"Which would make it the perfect place to recruit rebels, but...something must have gone wrong."
0,134,40,RAK'NOR,The planet was recently taken by Ba'al.
0,134,40,TEAL'C,"If Bra'tac and Ry'ac were in the camp when Ba'al's forces arrived, perhaps they were trapped."
0,134,40,RAK'NOR,Then they are lost.
0,134,40,JACKSON,Why?
0,134,40,RAK'NOR,The Stargate on Erebus is impenetrable.
0,134,40,TEAL'C,How so?
0,134,40,RAK'NOR,"A force field, much like your iris, blocks the Erebus Stargate, making attack or rescue through it impossible."
0,134,40,JACKSON,Someone must get through it somehow.
0,134,40,RAK'NOR,"We believe as signal must be used to power down the force field, but we have no way of knowing what that signal is."
0,134,40,BRA'TAC,"Now! Bra'tac, Ry'ac and a couple other Jaffa storm those still standing at the Stargate. Bra'tac takes a device off the wrist of one of the still-standing Jaffa and goes to the DHD. He begins dialing out. A wormhole is established and then a force field becomes visible over the Stargate. Bra'tac aims the device from the Jaffa at the Stargate and the force field disappears."
0,134,43,JACKSON,"I was there. I saw the whole thing happen. Nothing I could do...just watch. Powerless to interfere. Come on, it has to be there."
0,134,43,CARTER,Just give me a minute...
0,134,43,JACKSON,"See, I knew it had something to do with 'gate records, I just never thought of checking the Alpha Site 'gate records..."
0,134,43,CARTER,"Here. A coded energy signal was received and recorded through the Alpha Site 'gate three months ago. It was analyzed, but no one was able to determine its origin or its purpose."
0,134,43,JACKSON,That is the force field deactivation code I saw Bra'tac send right before he was captured.
0,134,43,CARTER,Are you sure?
0,134,43,JACKSON,I'm sure.
0,134,43,CARTER,"I can synthesize this energy signature. If it is the deactivation code, I can get us through the 'gate."
0,134,43,JACKSON,And I can provide details of their defenses and the lay of the land.
0,134,44,TEAL'C,O'Neill...I must tell you that I believe I may be a liability on this mission.
0,134,44,O'NEILL,I don't.
0,134,44,TEAL'C,"If I should die, it is my wish that you watch over Ry'ac."
0,134,44,O'NEILL,"Well, let's see it doesn't come to that, all right?"
0,134,45,O'NEILL,It's his son...
0,134,46,O'NEILL,"All right, let's do this."
0,134,47,CARTER,Sending signal now.
0,134,48,CARTER,Clear.
0,134,48,O'NEILL,"Okay, so, that happened. SG-3 secure these guys. Then establish a perimeter. Daniel... He motions for Daniel to lead the way as they head out."
0,134,49,RY'AC,"Master Bra'tac, it is difficult to ration that which you do not have."
0,134,49,BRA'TAC,If only you had not seen.
0,134,49,RY'AC,"I have seen. Now, tell me the truth. I'm not a child."
0,134,49,BRA'TAC,The Tretonin is gone.
0,134,49,RY'AC,Then you will die and all your words of faith will have been for nothing.
0,134,49,BRA'TAC,"No, Ry'ac! Not for nothing...for you. You might survive."
0,134,49,RY'AC,How long can you live without Tretonin?
0,134,49,BRA'TAC,As long as I have to.
0,134,50,O'NEILL,Penhall...trade. Give me that thing. Jack trades weapons with another SGC person. He give Penhall his P-90 and takes Penhall's sniper rifle. It has a stand and a high-powered scope on it. Sam is looking through binoculars beside Jack.
0,134,50,CARTER,"No sign of Bra'tac. Wait a minute, I've got Ry'ac."
0,134,51,TEAL'C,"If we can eliminate that guard position, we can create a blind spot."
0,134,52,TEAL'C,"Infiltration is the best option, O'Neill."
0,134,52,O'NEILL,"All right, it will be dark in an hour. Everybody, get comfortable."
0,134,53,CARTER,Go.
0,134,54,O'NEILL,"All right, they're in."
0,134,54,WHJ,"Jaffa, hol! Kal vak! Jack sees the White-Haired Jaffa walking toward the shelter, through his scope, and they are able to hear him because of the parabolic dish microphone that Daniel is holding."
0,134,54,O'NEILL,"Come on, come on."
0,134,54,WHJ,Rin nok!
0,134,54,O'NEILL,What's this?
0,134,54,JACKSON,"Oh, he's dressing the warrior down, I do the bidding of Ba'al. Shut up."
0,134,54,O'NEILL,Shut up?
0,134,54,JACKSON,"Yeah, I'm paraphrasing..."
0,134,54,WHJ,Kel mar tokeem. Tel mak kree. Meg tal.
0,134,54,JACKSON,"You're poisoned, you're...cursed by the wearer of horns, you're sloppy..."
0,134,54,WHJ,Oracca aseemu!
0,134,54,O'NEILL,"Oh, for cryin' out loud."
0,134,55,WHJ,Hol mel!
0,134,55,O'NEILL,Dammit!
0,134,55,CARTER,I think they've been made.
0,134,55,O'NEILL,Just hold on...
0,134,56,TEAL'C,Ry'ac...
0,134,56,RY'AC,"Father...I am sorry. Master Bra'tac said you'd come, but I did not believe."
0,134,56,TEAL'C,How is he?
0,134,56,RY'AC,"He still lives, but...I fear, not for long."
0,134,57,TEAL'C,Tek' matte.
0,134,57,BRA'TAC,Old friend...Rak'nor.
0,134,57,RAK'NOR,"Tek' matte, Master Bra'tac."
0,134,58,TEAL'C,There is enough for both of us.
0,134,59,RY'AC,We cannot hide here for long. It will take too much time for him to regain his strength to walk.
0,134,59,TEAL'C,Then we will carry him.
0,134,59,RAK'NOR,We've come to take you and Bra'tac away from this place.
0,134,59,RY'AC,What about them? What about all the others?
0,134,59,RAK'NOR,There are too many.
0,134,59,RY'AC,They can fight.
0,134,59,TEAL'C,And they will die.
0,134,59,RY'AC,"If they stay, they will die."
0,134,60,O'NEILL,"Teal'c, you've been made. Get outta there. Get out of there! Teal'c!"
0,134,61,WHJ,Kree chok!
0,134,62,O'NEILL,"Hold your fire, hold your fire."
0,134,63,CARTER,Sir?
0,134,63,O'NEILL,Just hold your position.
0,134,64,JACKSON,We're just gonna sit here?
0,134,64,O'NEILL,Yes! We've just got to sit here...until we can find another way in.
0,134,65,TEAL'C,Ry'ac...you are still alive?
0,134,65,RY'AC,"Yes, father."
0,134,65,TEAL'C,That is all that matters. What of Bra'tac?
0,134,65,RY'AC,"The Tretonin has helped. What of you, father? Can you walk?"
0,134,65,TEAL'C,Not at the moment.
0,134,65,RY'AC,You must. Those who cannot work are killed.
0,134,65,TEAL'C,"You must not lose your faith, Ry'ac. Rak'nor and I did not come alone. Even now, a rescue is underway."
0,134,66,CARTER,"Search patrol went off in that direction, heading for the Stargate."
0,134,66,O'NEILL,"Ah, they don't believe Teal'c and Rak'nor are working alone."
0,134,66,JACKSON,This is my fault.
0,134,66,O'NEILL,How's that?
0,134,66,JACKSON,Because I should have done something when I had the chance...when I had the power.
0,134,66,O'NEILL,"I think we've already established that wouldn't have worked out either. No, it's time for plan B."
0,134,66,CARTER,We have a plan B?
0,134,66,O'NEILL,No...but it's time for one.
0,134,66,CARTER,We've already determined there are too many guards for us to take out the whole camp with our current numbers.
0,134,66,JACKSON,We need a distraction.
0,134,66,CARTER,Grenades?
0,134,66,O'NEILL,Think bigger.
0,134,66,CARTER,Claymores?
0,134,66,O'NEILL,Much bigger.
0,134,69,O'NEILL,"Major, target"
0,134,71,RAK'NOR,His strength still grows.
0,134,71,TEAL'C,"Good...Ry'ac...you and Rak'nor must spread the word. If we wish for our rescue to be successful, the other must be prepared to fight."
0,134,71,RY'AC,How will they know when?
0,134,71,RAK'NOR,"When the time is right, they will know."
0,134,71,TEAL'C,Indeed.
0,134,71,RY'AC,Can you fight?
0,134,71,TEAL'C,I am...not the Jaffa I once was.
0,134,71,RY'AC,No.
0,134,71,TEAL'C,Ry'ac...
0,134,71,RY'AC,No. You are Teal'c. There is no greater warrior...
0,134,71,TEAL'C,Ry'ac...I am...weak.
0,134,71,RY'AC,"Father, please..."
0,134,71,TEAL'C,Ry'ac! No matter what...you must survive. You must survive...or I have come for nothing. No go.
0,134,73,CARTER,"Once this panel goes, it'll only take a few seconds for the entire anti-gravity platform to shut down. She sets the timer at five minutes and starts the clock ticking before she and Daniel run out of the room."
0,134,74,BRA'TAC,It has been difficult...for both of us.
0,134,74,TEAL'C,You are feeling better.
0,134,74,BRA'TAC,"You will not be rid of me so easily. When the time comes, I will be ready, old friend."
0,134,74,TEAL'C,As will I.
0,134,74,BRA'TAC,I am not so sure. This Tretonin seems to have had an effect on your memory.
0,134,74,TEAL'C,Why would you say such a thing?
0,134,74,BRA'TAC,"Because you have forgotten that a warrior's true strength comes from his heart and his mind. You have had a physical advantage over me for a long time. And yet, I have never lost a sparring match to you."
0,134,74,TEAL'C,"Because for years, old man, I have let you win."
0,134,74,BRA'TAC,Better...much better.
0,134,75,CARTER,This could be a problem.
0,134,76,WHJ,This is not your work station. Take him.
0,134,78,WHJ,"If you do not work, you will die. This one does not know where is work station is. He turns to aim a staff weapon at Ry'ac."
0,134,78,TEAL'C,But he is young and still able to work. He is flanked on either side by Rak'nor and Bra'tac.
0,134,78,WHJ,You dare to speak to me?
0,134,78,TEAL'C,Only to ask that I take his place.
0,134,78,WHJ,So be it.
0,134,79,RY'AC,No! Nooo!
0,134,80,WHJ,You are barely able to stand. You would not have lasted another day. It was a...good trade.
0,134,80,O'NEILL,"Carter, what's the hold up?"
0,134,80,CARTER,"We're a go in 30 seconds, Sir."
0,134,80,O'NEILL,Assume we do not have 30 seconds.
0,134,80,WHJ,"You were once the first prime of Apophis. Now you're nothing but a weak, pathetic sholva."
0,134,81,BRA'TAC,Do not look away. Be strong for him. What better way for Teal'c to die that to be looking upon the face of his son?
0,134,83,WHJ,Kree! Trey long tonok!
0,134,84,BRA'TAC,Take them now!
0,134,85,O'NEILL,"Come on, boys. Have at 'em!"
0,134,86,RY'AC,Wait!
0,134,87,RY'AC,Father!
0,134,89,HAMMOND,"Welcome back, SG-1."
0,134,89,O'NEILL,"The camp has been liberated, Sir, all the prisoners relocated to the Alpha Site."
0,134,89,JACKSON,They are anxious to join the rebellion.
0,134,89,BRA'TAC,"Then my mission has been a success. Hammond, of Texas, I find myself once more in your debt."
0,134,89,HAMMOND,I think it's Dr. Jackson you owe on this one.
0,134,89,TEAL'C,Indeed.
0,134,91,TEAL'C,"Kelnoreem is unnecessary, although it does make me feel...better. Colonel O'Neill has officially informed me that...I have my...Mojo back."
0,134,91,JACKSON,"I guess I-I should be thanking you, actually. You see, I used to...I used to feel like I didn't belong...anywhere, really. I think I thought that, uh, this whole ascension thing would change that. And now I'm realizing that the sacrifices were far too great. And my life here is far too important to just leave behind. I guess what I'm trying to say is that, uh, for the first time in my life, I feel like I'm a part of something...something important."
0,134,91,TEAL'C,As do I.
