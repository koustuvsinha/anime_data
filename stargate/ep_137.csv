0,137,0,"""ENEMY MINE""",By Peter DeLuise
0,137,1,EDWARDS,God...three months on this rock and I still can't get a decent cup of coffee.
0,137,1,LORNE,"Core sample analysis still coming in, but so far...highest concentration is 2.3 parts per million."
0,137,1,EDWARDS,"2.3 parts... Major Lorne, we need enough naquadah to manufacture 303s. You know how big a battle cruiser is?"
0,137,1,LORNE,"It's pretty big, sir."
0,137,1,EDWARDS,"Hmm...if we start mining these deposits right now, today, your great- grandchildren are still gonna be trying to pull out enough ore just to make one."
0,137,2,MENARD,Colonel Edwards?
0,137,2,EDWARDS,Menard...
0,137,2,MENARD,"You're gonna want to see this, sir. Latest sample analysis shows a concentration fifty times higher than anything we've seen so far... and-and it's increasing as we go deeper. This could be the one, sir."
0,137,2,EDWARDS,"Yeah. If this pans out, your great- grandchildren might just be off the hook."
0,137,2,LORNE,"Yes, sir."
0,137,4,MENARD,Colonel Edwards?
0,137,4,EDWARDS,"I'm glad you're here, Jack. We're not trained for search and rescue. And Ritter's been missing now for three hours."
0,137,4,O'NEILL,I assume he's got a compass and a radio?
0,137,4,LORNE,The planet has peculiar electromagnetic properties which make a compass useless and severely limit the range of our radios.
0,137,4,EDWARDS,"He's a good man and we need him back. Especially now, we think we may have discovered a significant deposit of naquadah."
0,137,4,TEAL'C,How significant?
0,137,4,LORNE,"Well, we won't know that until we complete our analysis."
0,137,4,EDWARDS,The Pentagon wants battle cruisers and F-302s. We find the rocks.
0,137,4,O'NEILL,And we find the rock...finders.
0,137,4,EDWARDS,There you have it. Uhm...Major Lorne will show you where Ritter was last seen...
0,137,4,LORNE,"Yes, sir. If you'll follow me..."
0,137,5,JACKSON,What's this?
0,137,6,JACKSON,Artifacts?
0,137,6,LORNE,Yes.
0,137,6,JACKSON,You found all this and you-you didn't contact me?
0,137,6,LORNE,We were going to...
0,137,6,JACKSON,They've been moved.
0,137,6,LORNE,"Well, the were in the way."
0,137,7,O'NEILL,Daniel...go to your happy place.
0,137,8,O'NEILL,Go.
0,137,9,LORNE,"Lt. Ritter was recording elevations and mapping the surrounding. When he didn't' show up for chow, we got worried and went out looking for him, sir. Uh...sent up a couple of flares...hoped he'd see 'em, get his bearings..."
0,137,9,O'NEILL,Is it normal for guys to wander away from camp?
0,137,9,LORNE,"Well, he might have been placing markers...you know, multiple sightings, some up to half a mile...you get turned around."
0,137,10,O'NEILL,Teal'c?
0,137,10,TEAL'C,"The ground is extremely firm, O'Neill."
0,137,10,O'NEILL,No tracks?
0,137,10,TEAL'C,"Not in the immediate area. However, there is considerable damage to the underbrush moving off in several different directions."
0,137,11,JACKSON,"Jack, come in."
0,137,11,O'NEILL,Yeah. Go ahead.
0,137,11,JACKSON,I've got...something...see
0,137,11,O'NEILL,I'm not reading you...say again.
0,137,11,JACKSON,"I said, I've got something here you need to see."
0,137,11,O'NEILL,All right. On my way. You guys keep looking. I'll be back.
0,137,13,O'NEILL,Whadda ya got?
0,137,13,JACKSON,"Well, most of the mining equipment could be several hundred years old. Hard to date it 'til I get back to the SGC. Remember these?"
0,137,13,O'NEILL,Ever so fondly.
0,137,14,JACKSON,Still has power...
0,137,14,O'NEILL,Just keeps going and going...
0,137,14,JACKSON,I want to show you the truly fascinating part. It's a yoke...capable of supporting or pulling great weight...evenly distributes the weight across the shoulders...and predates the harness on Earth.
0,137,14,O'NEILL,Fascinating...truly.
0,137,14,JACKSON,"Well, I was getting to the truly fascinating part. It's...it's too big, too heavy."
0,137,14,O'NEILL,Meaning?
0,137,14,JACKSON,Meaning it wasn't made for a human being.
0,137,14,O'NEILL,Who was it made for?
0,137,14,JACKSON,"Well, it's too small for a four-legged animal. If I had to make a guess, based on what I know about the Goa'uld, I'd say it was made for an Unas."
0,137,14,O'NEILL,Oh.
0,137,14,JACKSON,"Now, we know the Goa'uld used the Unas as slaves long before humans. They're predominately cave dwellers, incredibly strong and capable of working in harsh environments...perfect labor for this kind of mining."
0,137,14,O'NEILL,"This day just gets better and better. Teal'c, come in."
0,137,14,TEAL'C,Proceed O'Neill.
0,137,14,O'NEILL,Find anything?
0,137,14,TEAL'C,We have not.
0,137,14,O'NEILL,"Well, heads up. Daniel just found evidence and Unas might have been in the area."
0,137,14,TEAL'C,Acknowledged.
0,137,15,EDWARDS,"Okay, let me get this straight. You want me to delay this operation because you found some shoulder harness..."
0,137,15,JACKSON,"Yoke, actually..."
0,137,15,EDWARDS,"...that could be could be a hundred years old, built for a creature that probably disappeared or died off a long time ago."
0,137,16,JACKSON,It's not uncommon for Goa'uld to leave their slaves behind once they've lost interest in a planet.
0,137,16,EDWARDS,We've been here for three months. We haven't seen or heard anything like what you describe.
0,137,16,JACKSON,Maybe that's the way they want it.
0,137,16,EDWARDS,"Look. Doctor, I've got the Pentagon breathing down my neck, I've gotta show some results..."
0,137,16,JACKSON,"Colonel, you don't understand...Unas are territorial, and when provoked, they can be extremely dangerous."
0,137,16,EDWARDS,Is he always like this?
0,137,16,O'NEILL,"Yeah, pretty much..."
0,137,16,EDWARDS,"If these things really are here, do you think they had anything to do with, uh, Ritter gone missing?"
0,137,16,JACKSON,"Yes, I do."
0,137,16,EDWARDS,"Well, I'm not closing down this operation, that's for damn sure. But I do think we should bring in some extra troops...help secure the area."
0,137,17,LORNE,What is it?
0,137,17,TEAL'C,The Unas wear these to prevent the Goa'uld from burrowing into their necks.
0,137,18,TEAL'C,I believe these figures are intended as a warning to stay away.
0,137,19,TEAL'C,Lt. Ritter...
0,137,22,EDWARDS,All right! I want extra ammo for everyone. Keep your eyes open and stay in radio contact.
0,137,22,JACKSON,What are you intending to do?
0,137,22,EDWARDS,These things killed one of my men and strung him up like a scarecrow. What the hell do you think I intend to do?
0,137,22,JACKSON,"Well, you may have, unknowingly, provoked them."
0,137,22,EDWARDS,We didn't even know they were here. How the hell could we have provoked them?
0,137,22,JACKSON,"If this mine extends as far as your estimates say, then this other entrance would be well within the tunnel network. It's an alternate entrance to the same mine. Now, it has to be something about this area...this mine. They don't want us here."
0,137,22,EDWARDS,The feelings mutual.
0,137,22,JACKSON,Jack?
0,137,22,O'NEILL,"Look, I know he can be a little... but he's usually right about this stuff."
0,137,22,EDWARDS,"My orders are to determine the potential of this sight as a mining operation. Until those orders are rescinded, I'm going to do whatever it takes to ensure the safety of my people. So, are you going to help me secure this area, or not?"
0,137,23,JACKSON,This is a mistake...
0,137,23,O'NEILL,"It's his command, Daniel."
0,137,23,JACKSON,He's never encountered the Unas before. He doesn't know what he's dealing with...
0,137,24,JACKSON,Ka kecka!
0,137,25,JACKSON,Ka kecka!
0,137,26,IRON SHIRT,Ska nat? Ka ko kecka!
0,137,27,IRON SHIRT,Benna! Benna ka cha! Benna ka cha!
0,137,28,O'NEILL,Help him. Help him.
0,137,29,EDWARDS,My men'll take care of the rest of the wounded. They're on the run. Let's take 'em now.
0,137,30,EDWARDS,What's that? What are they doing now?
0,137,30,JACKSON,They're mourning their dead.
0,137,30,EDWARDS,"This may be our best chance. Come on, we're not just gonna let 'em get away, are we?"
0,137,30,O'NEILL,We're not gonna pursue an enemy into unknown terrain.
0,137,30,EDWARDS,"Jack, you make it sound like they're capable of tactics."
0,137,30,JACKSON,We've had dealing with them before. They're far more intelligent than you think.
0,137,30,EDWARDS,I don't care! They attacked us!
0,137,30,O'NEILL,Edwards! We're not goin' in.
0,137,30,EDWARDS,This is my command! You are here at my request!
0,137,30,JACKSON,You're in charge of a mining operation.
0,137,30,O'NEILL,"Your standing orders no longer apply! Now, let's take it back to SGC and we'll figure it out there."
0,137,30,EDWARDS,Fine.
0,137,31,O'NEILL,Ow! God! Get away...
0,137,32,CARTER,How's the arm?
0,137,32,O'NEILL,Good. How's the science project?
0,137,32,CARTER,You mean my complete overhaul of the 'gate diagnostic system?
0,137,32,O'NEILL,I guess that's what I mean...
0,137,32,CARTER,"It's going well, sir. Thank you for asking."
0,137,32,JACKSON,"Uh, if we go back to this planet, you're not coming with us, are you?"
0,137,32,O'NEILL,It's doubtful.
0,137,32,JACKSON,Yeah...that's too bad. I was kinda hoping you'd take command of the mission. Colonel Edwards has no experience dealing with the Unas.
0,137,32,O'NEILL,"Nor you... He's an okay guy, Daniel. He's just under a lot of pressure."
0,137,32,JACKSON,"Yeah, yeah. I...I guess I just spent a lot of time breaking you in, I just didn't want to have to start with a new colonel."
0,137,32,O'NEILL,It'll be fine.
0,137,33,O'NEILL,Just...try not to be so....
0,137,33,JACKSON,What?
0,137,33,O'NEILL,"Oh, you know... Jack lies back on the bed, slowly. He groans a little."
0,137,34,HAMMOND,"Colonel, General Vidrine is down from the Pentagon. He's been put in charge of BC-303 production."
0,137,34,VIDRINE,"We've read your report, colonel, and we agree that the evacuation was warranted. Unfortunately, however, with the Prometheus stranded halfway across the galaxy, Earth is currently vulnerable to orbital attack. Now, if someone can show me another way to acquire naquadah, or can make a battle cruiser without it, I'm listening. Otherwise we've got to go back to P3X-403."
0,137,34,EDWARDS,"With enough men and enough fire power, I can take care of your problem, sir."
0,137,34,HAMMOND,"Well, that's one way to address the situation. But we've dealt with these creatures before and I can guarantee you it isn't going to be as easy as you think it is."
0,137,34,VIDRINE,"Well, be that as it may, the Pentagon's position is quite clear on this. Colonel Edwards will return to the planet and begin mining operations immediately. SG personnel will provide security on a continuing basis. Now, if this leads to hostilities..."
0,137,35,JACKSON,It will.
0,137,35,VIDRINE,Dr. Jackson...I don't believe you were invited to this meeting...
0,137,35,JACKSON,"Yes, General, I know. I'm sorry, but please...hear me out. I think the situation can be resolved peacefully."
0,137,36,VIDRINE,How?
0,137,36,JACKSON,"Well, we've been on this planet a long time looking for the best mine site. It wasn't until we encroached on this one particular region that the Unas attacked. I mean, can't we just mine somewhere else...away from this...this one area?"
0,137,36,EDWARDS,"All the other mine sites we've surveyed have been void of significant deposits. This is the only site we've found, thus far, that might satisfy production quotas."
0,137,36,JACKSON,And if this leads to another dead end?
0,137,36,VIDRINE,Then we won't have a problem. But I'm not going to walk away from this until I know for sure.
0,137,36,JACKSON,"Well, then, can we at least try to negotiate with them?"
0,137,36,EDWARDS,"They're animals, sir."
0,137,36,JACKSON,They are not animals. They are intelligent beings with a sense of honor and if you underestimate them more will die on both sides.
0,137,36,VIDRINE,Who would negotiate on our behalf? You?
0,137,36,JACKSON,"I can speak their language with a limited vocabulary and I have a-a rudimentary understanding of their ways, but...this has gone too far for me to handle myself."
0,137,36,VIDRINE,"What are you proposing, Doctor?"
0,137,36,JACKSON,I suggest we use Chaka as a liason.
0,137,36,VIDRINE,Chaka?
0,137,36,JACKSON,"He's an Unas we met on a different planet... Now, I've had periodic contact with him. He's made impressive progress in his understanding of us. Look, we've interacted with these beings before and lived. Chaka, himself, saved my life. This is their planet. We're the invaders. We don't have to provoke them. We don't have to kill them."
0,137,36,VIDRINE,"Well, I'm sure no one wants that, Dr. Jackson."
0,137,36,JACKSON,"Yes, I'm sure."
0,137,36,HAMMOND,"If the negotiations are resolved in the time allotted to determine the viability of the mine, you're giving up nothing by letting him try."
0,137,36,VIDRINE,All right. You may proceed.
0,137,36,HAMMOND,Dr. Jackson...you'll contact Chaka and return him here without delay.
0,137,36,VIDRINE,One more thing...so that there's no confusion...if negotiations fail and it comes down to us or them...I choose us. The use of deadly force is authorized.
0,137,38,DAVIS,
0,137,38,HAMMOND,Open the iris.
0,137,39,HAMMOND,Stand down.
0,137,39,JACKSON,Chaka's never been in a structure like this before.
0,137,39,VIDRINE,Uhm...
0,137,40,CHAKA,A cha' aka.
0,137,40,JACKSON,"Uh...a cha'aka...is a greeting. In this case, he's, uh, he's saying 'hello'."
0,137,40,CHAKA,ell...o
0,137,40,EDWARDS,Pfft.
0,137,40,CHAKA,Pfft.
0,137,40,JACKSON,"Uhm...I've had a chance to talk with Chaka. Over the past year he's managed to accomplish some remarkable things. On the planet where Chaka now lives, humans used Unas as domesticated slaves. But Chaka led an uprising and..."
0,137,40,EDWARDS,An uprising? You neglected to mention this before. How many people were killed in this uprising?
0,137,40,JACKSON,"That's not the point. Chaka brokered a truce and over time established a fragile, yet successful peace between the humans and the Unas who were formerly their slaves. Now, if he could manage to do this, I know he could act as a peaceful liaison between ourselves and the Unas of P3X-403."
0,137,40,HAMMOND,Does he even want to help us?
0,137,40,JACKSON,I've informed him of what we need to do...He's eager to meet Unas of other worlds. Tar ma...kan ko?
0,137,40,CHAKA,huh? 'Uman 'elp Chaka...Chaka 'elp 'uman.
0,137,41,LORNE,Looks like the Unas had a little party while we were gone.
0,137,41,EDWARDS,"You're right, Dr. Jackson. They're much more advanced than what I thought. They have command of fire. Major Lorne, as soon as this place is cleaned up, I want you to get a resonance scan analysis of the lower mine shafts."
0,137,41,LORNE,"Yes, sir."
0,137,41,EDWARDS,"Exactly how do you intend to find these Unas, Doctor?"
0,137,41,JACKSON,I think Chaka will lead us to them.
0,137,42,JACKSON,Chaka...
0,137,43,JACKSON,"Colonel, he knows you don't like him. If you keep staring at him like that, he's going to take it as a challenge. Chaka, ka kreeka."
0,137,44,EDWARDS,Just keep him away from me. Hanson! Penhall! You're with them. The rest of you people! I want this perimeter secured...anti-personnel and overlapping fields of fire! Move it!
0,137,44,JACKSON,He's getting ready for a war.
0,137,44,TEAL'C,He has a responsibility to protect this camp.
0,137,44,JACKSON,"Yeah, or he's looking for revenge for Lt. Ritter."
0,137,45,CHAKA,'Uman...tatack?
0,137,45,JACKSON,Ka...no. We're not going to attack.
0,137,45,CHAKA,Tonok shesh. 'Uman tatack.
0,137,45,JACKSON,"He says that our weapons and the size of our group are...alarming, create fear. It seems like we intend to attack."
0,137,45,CHAKA,"Ka, Dan'el. Chaka ka cha."
0,137,45,JACKSON,He wants me to go with him alone.
0,137,45,CHAKA,Ka keka.
0,137,45,JACKSON,Unarmed.
0,137,45,TEAL'C,You will be completely helpless.
0,137,45,JACKSON,I'll be all right.
0,137,45,TEAL'C,"This is unwise, Daniel Jackson."
0,137,45,JACKSON,"Look, we can't make contact with them if they think we're going to attack."
0,137,45,TEAL'C,Are you certain?
0,137,45,JACKSON,"Yeah...yeah, I'm, uh, I'm certain."
0,137,46,JACKSON,"Staff weapons, torture sticks, manacles...symbols of pain and death. Chaka...here. I got a new toy."
0,137,47,CHAKA,Aka.
0,137,47,JACKSON,You're welcome.
0,137,47,CHAKA,"A cha' aka, a cha' aka, a cha' aka..."
0,137,47,JACKSON,'Come sit by my fire'...Unas diplomacy.
0,137,47,CHAKA,"A cha' aka, a cha' aka, a cha' aka..."
0,137,47,JACKSON,Chaka? How long is this...uhm...
0,137,48,JACKSON,Kel nok...ma kan ska nat?
0,137,48,CHAKA,Nok.
0,137,48,JACKSON,Now?
0,137,48,CHAKA,Ka nok.
0,137,48,JACKSON,Later?
0,137,48,CHAKA,"A cha' aka, a cha' aka, a cha' aka..."
0,137,48,JACKSON,It will take as long as it takes...okay.
0,137,49,CHAKA,"A cha' aka, a cha' aka, a cha' aka..."
0,137,50,JACKSON,Helloooo...
0,137,51,JACKSON,I hope you know what you're doing...
0,137,52,JACKSON,Down...good idea.
0,137,53,JACKSON,Trade...
0,137,54,IRON SHIRT,Aka.
0,137,54,CHAKA,A cha' aka. Te Chaka.
0,137,54,IRON SHIRT,Ta?
0,137,54,JACKSON,"Uhm, a cha' aka. Te...Daniel."
0,137,54,IRON SHIRT,Dan'el...
0,137,54,JACKSON,Dan'el's fine.
0,137,54,IRON SHIRT,Te Kor Asek Zo...huh!
0,137,54,JACKSON,Kor is iron...Asek...
0,137,55,JACKSON,"Shirt? Iron Shirt, the alpha male..."
0,137,55,IRON SHIRT,Kel ko tar?
0,137,55,CHAKA,Tar 'uman. 'Uman...ka ne.
0,137,55,IRON SHIRT,Kel ko kecka?
0,137,55,JACKSON,"Uh, yes...we brought death, but, but...we wanna be...friends. Uh, to preserve life, ska nat."
0,137,55,CHAKA,"Ska nat. Unas, Kor Asek, a Chaka, a 'Uman. Ska nat te."
0,137,55,JACKSON,That's right. We work this out...we-we all win.
0,137,56,IRON SHIRT,"Cho' ee' che, Chaka."
0,137,57,IRON SHIRT,Dan'el.
0,137,58,JACKSON,"Cho' ee' che, Kor Asek."
0,137,59,JACKSON,"Okay, all right. Now we're talking', huh?"
0,137,60,LORNE,Dr. Jackson...how'd it go?
0,137,60,JACKSON,"Well, I figured out why they attacked us. It's this mine...it's sacred to them. Most of their ancestors were worked to death by the Goa'uld while they were mining it. It's a wonder they didn't attack us the minute we set foot on this planet."
0,137,60,LORNE,"Doctor, look..."
0,137,60,JACKSON,Now I told them I'd speak to my superiors on their behalf. Sacred burial grounds are protected on Earth from industrial development. I think the same rule should apply here. We have to leave.
0,137,60,LORNE,We got the results of the resonance scan. The deposit is over 300 meters in length and almost completely solid.
0,137,61,EDWARDS,"53,000 metric tons...we're not going anywhere."
0,137,62,JACKSON,"My meeting with the Unas went well, sir. Uh, they're reluctant to trust us, but I did manage to open up a line of communication."
0,137,62,VIDRINE,How many of them are there?
0,137,62,JACKSON,I only saw a medium-sized clan. I can't be sure...why?
0,137,62,VIDRINE,We need to know if we're going to relocate them.
0,137,62,JACKSON,"They'll never accept relocation, sir. They won't understand it."
0,137,62,VIDRINE,"Then it's your job to make them understand. If you don't, we'll have to go in there with tranquilizers and capture them."
0,137,62,JACKSON,"They're not animals...Look, I'm pretty sure Chaka and I can accomplish something. Just...let me go talk to them again."
0,137,62,HAMMOND,"You have 24 hours to convince the Unas to come peacefully, or they'll be forcibly removed."
0,137,63,IRON SHIRT,'Uman ko kecka onoc. Unas ko kecka onoc.
0,137,63,JACKSON,"That's right, that's right. We should not be fighting with each other. The- the Goa'uld are a common enemy."
0,137,63,CHAKA,Ka nay.
0,137,63,JACKSON,"Ka nay...friend, uh, clan member. Daniel gestures by clasping his hands together."
0,137,63,IRON SHIRT,'Uman ka nay. He mimics Daniel's gesture.
0,137,64,JACKSON,That's right. That's right. So... We're going to give you...food... 'Uman ko non Unas. And in exchange...we need this.
0,137,64,IRON SHIRT,Kada.
0,137,64,JACKSON,"Kada...yes, we need kada to make war with the Goa'uld."
0,137,64,CHAKA,'Uman ko kada. Tonok tok onoc.
0,137,64,IRON SHIRT,Kel?
0,137,64,JACKSON,"How? Well, we make, uh...ships out of it. Uhm... Right...why would either of you know what a ship was? Uh...this. You know what this is."
0,137,64,IRON SHIRT,Kekata.
0,137,64,JACKSON,"Kekata...yes. Uh, we can make kekata with this. Kada. Now, with many kekata... We can bring death to the Goa'uld. The Onac."
0,137,64,IRON SHIRT,Ka kecka onac?
0,137,64,JACKSON,That's right.
0,137,65,SOLDIER ONE,Hold.
0,137,67,JACKSON,'Uman a Unas ma kan nok.
0,137,67,IRON SHIRT,Kel?
0,137,67,JACKSON,Why? Because if we don't come to some sort of agreement...'Uman zo...relocate you. Uh... Relocate. Ta 'relocate'?
0,137,67,CHAKA,Shesh.

0,137,68,JACKSON,Ko ka cha. 'Uman ko ka cha Unas ka no na...away from your home.
0,137,68,IRON SHIRT,Ko ka cha Unas ka no na? Tok!
0,137,68,JACKSON,"No, no, no. Defiance will only lead to Unas bloodshed. Ka tok. Uhm...'Uman ko keka te. Keka Unas."
0,137,68,IRON SHIRT,'Uman ka ko keka te Unas. Unas ko keka te 'Uman.
0,137,68,JACKSON,"No, you won't give us death. You can't win."
0,137,68,IRON SHIRT,A Unas naya tok!
0,137,68,JACKSON,"All the tribes will fight...How many? Uh, kel ka naya?"
0,137,68,IRON SHIRT,Soseka.

0,137,69,JACKSON,"Teal'c, come in. Teal'c, this is Daniel. Do you read me? Over. Dammit. Um...uh, uh...uh, just wait here. Lota. Lota. Lota. Lota."
0,137,72,JACKSON,"Oh, God."
0,137,72,EDWARDS,What happened? What happened?
0,137,72,SOLDIER ONE,It was coming up on my position. It was attacking.
0,137,72,JACKSON,It was attacking... The necklace. This necklace was precious to him. He was coming back for it and we killed him.
0,137,72,SOLDIER ONE,I didn't know...
0,137,72,EDWARDS,No need to apologize...
0,137,73,TEAL'C,They are preparing to attack.
0,137,73,EDWARDS,Let 'em come...we're ready.
0,137,73,JACKSON,"No, you're not."
0,137,75,JACKSON,"Colonel, we have to get out of here right now."
0,137,75,EDWARDS,I don't buy it.
0,137,75,JACKSON,Are you hearing this?
0,137,75,EDWARDS,A population that large would have been seen by aerial scans.
0,137,75,JACKSON,Unas live primarily underground in caves where aerial scans don't detect them.
0,137,75,TEAL'C,Our position will be overrun.
0,137,75,JACKSON,I was this close to working on an agreement with them. They just want to be left alone.
0,137,76,CHAKA,Dan'el!
0,137,77,JACKSON,Hold your fire!
0,137,77,EDWARDS,"If they attack, we will defend ourselves!"
0,137,79,EDWARDS,"You're right, Dr. Jackson. Let's get back to the 'gate."
0,137,79,JACKSON,"No, it's too late. If we move now, they'll run us down."
0,137,80,EDWARDS,What's he doing?
0,137,80,JACKSON,I don't know.
0,137,81,JACKSON,Don't do anything stupid...He's giving us a chance.
0,137,81,EDWARDS,A chance to do what?
0,137,82,JACKSON,To surrender.
0,137,82,EDWARDS,Surrender? Not possible.
0,137,82,JACKSON,"Don't do it, colonel."
0,137,83,JACKSON,Kor Asek...'Uman a ta ka keka.
0,137,83,EDWARDS,What are you saying?
0,137,83,JACKSON,I'm saying we don't have to kill each other. 'Uman a te a ka naya. We can be of the same tribe. A ka naya ko keka Onac. Together we can bring death to the Goa'uld.

0,137,83,IRON SHIRT,Dan'el...cho' ee' che. 'Uman ko keka Unas.
0,137,83,JACKSON,"He's saying that...while we talk peace, Humans kill Unas. He doesn't believe me. We have to show respect. We have to get down on the ground."
0,137,84,EDWARDS,On the ground? There's no way I'm gettin' down on the...
0,137,84,JACKSON,"Colonel, this is the way their social order works! We have to show submissiveness to show that we're not a threat, that we're not challenging them! We have to get down on the ground and that is all that we have to do."
0,137,85,JACKSON,"Colonel...everyone, please?"
0,137,86,IRON SHIRT,Benna... A benna! A tar 'Uman! On-or.
0,137,86,JACKSON,Honor. He understands. Cho' ee' che...Kor Asek.
0,137,87,JACKSON,Now we can negotiate.
0,137,88,EDWARDS,How long do we have to kneel?
0,137,88,JACKSON,As long as it takes. She smiles a little and nods to Iron Shirt. Iron Shirt hisses back.
0,137,89,IRON SHIRT,"A cha' aka, Dan'el."
0,137,89,JACKSON,"A cha' aka, Kor Asek."
0,137,90,JACKSON,"Well, I think we've got ourselves a deal."
0,137,90,EDWARDS,"And what deal would that be, Dr. Jackson?"
0,137,90,JACKSON,"Well, we've agreed not to desecrate their sacred ground any more."
0,137,90,EDWARDS,We have?
0,137,90,JACKSON,"And in exchange... ...the Unas will honor their dead by helping defeat their ancestors killers, the Goa'uld."
0,137,90,EDWARDS,And just how are they going to do that?
0,137,90,JACKSON,They're going to work the mine themselves.
0,137,90,EDWARDS,What? Did you propose this?
0,137,90,JACKSON,"No, actually, it, uh, was Iron Shirt."
0,137,91,EDWARDS,"Okay, let me get this straight...the Unas are going to mine this deposit and turn all the naquadah over to us?"
0,137,91,JACKSON,That's right...
0,137,91,EDWARDS,"Can they, uh, work a jackhammer?"
0,137,91,JACKSON,"I think you'll find they are very intelligent and can learn. You treat them with honor and respect and, uh...and you'll find out what kind of allies they can be."
0,137,91,EDWARDS,"O'Neill was right about you. You are a pain in the ass...but, well worth it. He gives Daniel's shoulder a little tap."
0,137,92,IRON SHIRT,Ah...Dan'el.
0,137,93,JACKSON,Aka...
