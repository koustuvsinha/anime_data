0,139,0,"""AVENGER 2.0""",By Paul Mullie & Joseph Mallozzi
0,139,1,FELGER,What time is it?
0,139,1,CHLOE,It's two minutes past the last time you asked me.
0,139,1,FELGER,"Oh, she should be here any second."
0,139,1,CHLOE,"Relax, Jay."
0,139,1,FELGER,Relax? We're on the verge of a major scientific breakthrough. This...this weapon could be the-the key factor in our fight against the Goa'uld.
0,139,1,CHLOE,Is it defeating the Goa'uld you're worried about or impressing Major Carter?
0,139,1,FELGER,"Hey...unlike some people in this room, I've seen what the Goa'uld can do, first hand."
0,139,1,CHLOE,"Yes, I know...you've told me a thousand times. You rescued SG-1 from the evil 'Lord What's-His-Name'."
0,139,1,FELGER,Her'ak. And he wasn't an evil lord. He was a first prime.
0,139,1,CHLOE,Jay...you're a brilliant scientist. Someday you're going to win the Nobel prize. What do you care what these military types think of you anyway?
0,139,1,FELGER,"You don't get it. You know, when you've stood side by side with someone and stared into the face of death, it creates an unspoken bond, an understanding that transcends simple friendship. Colonel O'Neill and I have been to hell and back together. When the mission was over, he looked me in the eye and do you know what he said to me? He said..."
0,139,1,O'NEILL,Is this gonna take long?
0,139,2,FELGER,Colonel O'Neill...
0,139,2,O'NEILL,Folger?
0,139,2,FELGER,"Felger...I-I w-wasn't expecting you, sir."
0,139,2,O'NEILL,"Yes...well, Major Carter said this was important."
0,139,3,FELGER,D-d-d-d-don't touch. Don't touch...don't touch...please. This is a finely calibrated device. It fires a focused plasma pulse... Boom!
0,139,4,CARTER,"It's an energy-based weapon, sir. It could, potentially, replace the missiles on the X-303."
0,139,4,O'NEILL,Phaser?
0,139,4,CHLOE,More like a photon torpedo.
0,139,4,FELGER,"My assistant, Chloe. There you are."
0,139,4,O'NEILL,Chloe...
0,139,4,FELGER,"This is all based on a Goa'uld design...and if you'll join me to the rear of the weapon...we will proceed with the demonstration. My friends, I present to you... ...the 22nd century."
0,139,5,FELGER,That wasn't supposed to happen.
0,139,6,FELGER,"I know, but I am really, really, really sorry, General and I can assure you that nothing like this will ever happen again."
0,139,6,HAMMOND,You're damn right it won't because I'm pulling the plug on your research.
0,139,6,FELGER,"No-no, no-no-no, please, this was just a minor glitch - minor glitch...I mean, we are so close to a working prototype..."
0,139,6,HAMMOND,"You've been saying that for the last six months. In fact, I've been reviewing your records. It seems that most of the projects you've overseen during your tenure here have been similarly long on promise and short on results."
0,139,6,FELGER,Right...what-what exactly are you saying?
0,139,6,HAMMOND,I'm saying it may be time for the Air Force to rethink your position here.
0,139,6,FELGER,"Okay, you know...that-that would be a mistake...because, um...I - you know, it just so happens that-that I'm working on a, uh, a line of research, and it's, uh, it's...it's, uh, yeah, well, really I'm on the verge of a major break-through, really."
0,139,6,HAMMOND,Really?
0,139,6,FELGER,"Really, yes, yes...and it's - it's gonna be HUGE! Huge, this thing...and-and it's gonna make the plasma weapon look like a squirt gun...sir."
0,139,6,CARTER,What is it?
0,139,6,FELGER,Hmm?
0,139,6,CARTER,What is it?
0,139,6,FELGER,"What is it? It's-it's, uh, well, really, you know, I-I'm not ready for a formal presentation just yet. You know, I still gotta...you know, crunch a few numbers and dot a few i's and...I could probably have something ready for you by the, uh, en-end of next week."
0,139,6,HAMMOND,You have 24 hours.
0,139,6,FELGER,More than enough time.
0,139,7,HAMMOND,Dismissed.
0,139,7,FELGER,Thank you.
0,139,7,BACK IN HIS LAB,Chloe is not happy.
0,139,7,CHLOE,What were you thinking?
0,139,7,FELGER,"I don't know! I had to say something. They were going to fire me. Besides, what's the big deal? All we have to do is think of something that's going to change the balance of power in the galaxy by noon tomorrow."
0,139,7,CHLOE,You have anything in mind?
0,139,7,FELGER,"As a matter of fact, I do...Avenger."
0,139,7,CHLOE,You've got to be kidding.
0,139,7,FELGER,"No, it's perfect!"
0,139,7,CHLOE,It's no where near ready! It's just an idea!
0,139,7,FELGER,We can make it work...
0,139,7,CHLOE,"Oh, Jay...this is exactly your problem. You try so hard to impress people that you always bite off more than you can chew."
0,139,7,FELGER,"Okay. Yes, you're right. I have to start setting more realistic goals for myself. Right after this project. Okay?"
0,139,9,CARTER,A computer virus?
0,139,9,FELGER,"Yeah...see, when you think about it, the-the 'gate network is nothing more than a bunch of linked computers. I mean, delivering the virus is as simple as dialing the target 'gate and uploading the program."
0,139,9,CARTER,The virus would then scramble the DHD's established coordinates.
0,139,9,FELGER,"Yeah, so the symbols no longer correspond with the proper coordinates, you see? It's like rearranging the letters on your keyboard."
0,139,9,CARTER,Then the target 'gate would be useless.
0,139,9,FELGER,"Yeah, I mean, sure, the Goa'uld have ships, but...you know, they-they still rely heavily on 'gate travel and that would be a real tactical advantage for us, don't you think? What do you think?"
0,139,9,CARTER,It's interesting...
0,139,9,FELGER,Really?
0,139,9,CARTER,But you don't have a finished program.
0,139,9,FELGER,"Uh, well, uh, finished... ...not finished, per se, no. Uh, but I really still have to, you know, just..."
0,139,9,CARTER,"...crunch a few numbers, dot a few i's?"
0,139,9,FELGER,"...i's...that's really it. Exactly, yeah."
0,139,9,CARTER,"Well, I'll take a look at it. If it shows promise, I'll...take it to General Hammond."
0,139,9,FELGER,"Oh, yes! Okay..."
0,139,9,CARTER,"Whoa, whoa...don't celebrate just yet. This is far from a done deal."
0,139,9,FELGER,"No, no. Of course not, of course not."
0,139,10,FELGER,Yes! Yes! Where am I? How'd she get me here? He walks off screen again.
0,139,11,O'NEILL,"So, you'd rather stay here and geek out some computer program than come with us, huh?"
0,139,11,CARTER,"Don't take it personally, sir. I just think this research shows a lot of promise."
0,139,11,O'NEILL,It's Felger...
0,139,11,CARTER,"He did save our lives, Colonel."
0,139,11,O'NEILL,"Yeah, don't remind me."
0,139,11,TEAL'C,The ability to disable any 'gate we choose could prove to be a valuable weapon in our struggle against the Goa'uld.
0,139,11,O'NEILL,If it works...
0,139,11,CARTER,That's what I intend to find out.
0,139,11,O'NEILL,Don't forget your safety glasses. Marines...thanks for joining us. Let's move out.
0,139,11,HAMMOND,"To be honest, Major, I share come of the Colonel's skepticism."
0,139,11,CARTER,"I know Dr. Felger's record is a little sketchy, sir. But I still think he shows a lot of potential. All he needs is a little support."
0,139,12,FELGER,Just a minute...
0,139,13,FELGER,Ooooh...geez...
0,139,14,FELGER,"I'll be-I'll be with you in a second...just, you know, uh, p-putting the dogs out."
0,139,15,FELGER,Oh...Major Carter...
0,139,15,CARTER,"I was in the neighborhood...This isn't a bad time, is it?"
0,139,16,FELGER,"Oh, no, no, no...please, come in, come in, come in. Just, uh, you know, just, uh, really wasn't, uh, expecting anyone. I'm sorry."
0,139,16,CARTER,Nice place.
0,139,16,FELGER,"Oh, thank you, thank you. Yes, I was just, uh, having my apartment fumigated. Can I, uh, can I offer you anything?"
0,139,17,CARTER,"No, no, I'm fine."
0,139,17,FELGER,"Oh, alrighty. Please, please."
0,139,18,FELGER,"Uh, what, uh, what uh, what brings you by?"
0,139,18,CARTER,
0,139,18,FELGER,And?
0,139,18,CARTER,And he's agreed to give you another chance.
0,139,18,FELGER,"Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God. That's great. That's great. Oh, whoo, 'cuz I thought I was so done for after that little...incident thing there. That was..."
0,139,18,CARTER,"Well, there is one condition..."
0,139,18,FELGER,Sure...okay...
0,139,18,CARTER,He wants me to work on the project with you.
0,139,19,FELGER,"That'd be, uh, you?"
0,139,19,CARTER,"Yeah, that's not a problem, is it?"
0,139,19,FELGER,"No, no, no...God, no, no. What about"
0,139,19,CARTER,"Well, Daniel's working on a relocation project...P3L-997..."
0,139,19,FELGER,The moon in the decaying orbit?
0,139,19,CARTER,They're experiencing some severe seismic disturbances and some weather anomalies.
0,139,19,FELGER,"Mmm, mmm...and then, what about, you know, Colonel O'Neill? Teal'c?"
0,139,19,CARTER,"Uh, they have a series of negotiations with the rebel Jaffa leaders. There's been some infighting, some old rivalries cropping up."
0,139,19,FELGER,"Well, they have to settle that... yeah, yeah, yeah...I guess that means you get stuck with me, then."
0,139,19,CARTER,"No, no, I wouldn't put it that way. I think the basic idea behind the virus is, actually, quite brilliant."
0,139,19,FELGER,No... Really?
0,139,19,CARTER,Yeah.
0,139,21,CHLOE,A tie?
0,139,21,FELGER,I wear ties.
0,139,21,CHLOE,And cologne?
0,139,21,FELGER,"You know, there is nothing wrong with a man taking pride in his appearance...and smell."
0,139,21,CHLOE,"This wouldn't have anything to do with Major Carter coming to work with us, would it?"
0,139,21,FELGER,Don't be ridiculous.
0,139,21,CHLOE,Here...let me.
0,139,21,FELGER,"Thanks. Of course, though, you know, you do have to admit, she possesses one of the most...brilliant scientific minds of our generation...and a pair of legs that won't quit. Okay, okay."
0,139,21,CHLOE,Sorry.
0,139,21,FELGER,"Well, anyway, what chance has a guy like me got with a woman like that? She barely notices I'm alive. You know what that's like?"
0,139,21,CHLOE,A little.
0,139,22,CARTER,Morning.
0,139,22,FELGER,"Oh, hi...hi."
0,139,22,CARTER,Nice...tie.
0,139,22,FELGER,"Oh, thanks."
0,139,26,CARTER,"We think the virus is ready, sir. Of course, other than computer simulations, there's no real way to test it, except on another 'gate."
0,139,26,HAMMOND,Do you have a target in mind?
0,139,26,CARTER,"P5S-117...It's one of Ba'al's principal naquadah mining sites. If we could disable the 'gate, we could seriously disrupt his supply network."
0,139,26,HAMMOND,How will we know if the test is successful?
0,139,26,CARTER,There's a Tok'ra operative on the planet who will be able to relay the results of the test through their sub-space communication network.
0,139,26,HAMMOND,Send the virus.
0,139,26,CARTER,"Yes, sir."
0,139,27,CHLOE,You're going to wear a hole in the floor.
0,139,27,FELGER,"Those Tok'ra are taking the sweet time, aren't they? Huh? You think we would've heard something by now."
0,139,27,DAVIS,"Major Carter to the control room. Repeat, Major Carter to the control room."
0,139,27,FELGER,That's it.
0,139,28,CARTER,"Felger, what are you doing here?"
0,139,28,FELGER,What's going on?
0,139,28,CARTER,Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c must have scheduled contact.
0,139,28,DAVIS,"Getting a video signal, sir."
0,139,28,HAMMOND,"Colonel O'Neill, this is Hammond. Do you read?"
0,139,28,O'NEILL,"Nice to hear from you, General."
0,139,28,HAMMOND,"What's your status, Colonel?"
0,139,28,O'NEILL,"Well, the mission was going according to plan. Then we hit a little snag. We can't dial the 'gate."
0,139,28,HAMMOND,Say again?
0,139,28,O'NEILL,We cannot establish an outgoing wormhole. We've tried all kinds of addresses but...we just can't get a lock.
0,139,28,HAMMOND,"Stand by, Colonel."
0,139,29,FELGER,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, this is just a coincidence. There's no way this could have anything to do with my virus. No...could it?"
0,139,30,FELGER,"Look, I'm telling you, there's no possible way Avenger could have anything to do with this."
0,139,30,HAMMOND,Avenger?
0,139,30,FELGER,"That's what I call the virus. You know, it's named after a comic book I read when I was a kid...The Amazing Avenger? Green tights...purple cape. He was super strong, super fast. You know, not as fast as the Flash. That would be ridiculous. Of course, this isn't ringing any bells with anybody, is it?"
0,139,30,HAMMOND,Is there any chance we sent it to the wrong 'gate?
0,139,30,CARTER,"No, sir. We double-checked the coordinates. The viruse was sent here...P5S-117. Colonel O'Neill is on P3C-249, which is here. It is true that, relatively speaking, within the 'gate systems the planets are close together - about 400 light years - but that doesn't necessarily mean anything. And until we hear back from the Tok'ra..."
0,139,31,DAVIS,Unscheduled off-world activiation.
0,139,32,DAVIS,"Sir, we're receiving an audio transmission. It's the Tok'ra."
0,139,32,THELESS,This is Theless of the Tok'ra.
0,139,32,HAMMOND,This is General Hammond of Stargate Command.
0,139,32,THELESS,"General, I'm afraid I have to report a series of malfunctions within the 'gate system."
0,139,32,HAMMOND,Malfunctions?
0,139,32,THELESS,"Several 'gates have gone off-line. As yet, we have no idea why. We are still in the process of gathering information."
0,139,32,CARTER,"Theless, this is Major Carter. Do you have any information on a planet we've designated P5S-117?"
0,139,32,THELESS,"One moment, please. We are still waiting for a sub-space transmission from our operative in that system."
0,139,32,CARTER,Can you send us any data that you do have?
0,139,32,THELESS,Affirmative.
0,139,33,DAVIS,Transmission received.
0,139,34,CARTER,"Sir, I'm going to need a few minutes to analyze this information."
0,139,34,HAMMOND,Go.
0,139,35,FELGER,I'll go help.
0,139,36,CARTER,There it is.
0,139,37,FELGER,I still don't see how this is possible.
0,139,37,CARTER,Automatic correlative updates.
0,139,37,CHLOE,I thought those were supposed to happen only once every couple of hundred years.
0,139,37,CARTER,That was the theory.
0,139,38,HAMMOND,"Major Carter, report."
0,139,38,CARTER,"Sir, first I'd like to recommend that you begin recalling all of our off-world teams, immediately."
0,139,38,HAMMOND,It's already being done. The mining team from P4F-221 is coming through right now.
0,139,38,CARTER,"Well, you might want to tell them to hurry it up, sir."
0,139,38,HAMMOND,What have you got?
0,139,39,CARTER,This is the original target 'gate. This is Colonel O'Neill's position. These are the 'gates first reported off-line by the Tok'ra. A few minutes later...several more.
0,139,39,HAMMOND,They appear to be spreading out from the original 'gate.
0,139,39,CARTER,"Yes, sir."
0,139,39,HAMMOND,You still think this is a coincidence?
0,139,39,CARTER,"Well, sir, we think we may have an explanation. We know that the 'gate network has to undergo periodic correlative updates in order to compensate for stellar drift. Now, we've never witnessed it, but we believe that the 'gates dial each other automatically to transmit the new coordinates that apply to each address."
0,139,39,HAMMOND,And you believe Dr. Felger's virus initiated one of these updates?
0,139,39,CARTER,"It may have triggered an automatic internal protocol in the DHD. Before adapting the new scrambled coordinates, it dialed out and transmitted them to a few of the neighboring 'gates who then transmitted to a few more and so on and so on..."
0,139,39,FELGER,and so on...yeah.
0,139,39,HAMMOND,Is there any way we can stop it?
0,139,39,CHLOE,"There's no time, sir. If each 'gate only dials two others before adapting to the new system, the entire network will be infected in less than two hours."
0,139,39,CARTER,"We need to focus on getting as many people back as possible, sir."
0,139,40,FELGER,"He's really mad, isn't he?"
0,139,41,DAVIS,"That's the last of the miners, sir."
0,139,41,HAMMOND,Shut it down. What's next?
0,139,41,P3L-997.,
0,139,41,CARTER,"That's Daniel's team, sir."
0,139,41,HAMMOND,Dial it.
0,139,42,CHLOE,"Okay, breath. Everything's gonna be fine."
0,139,42,FELGER,Grover Cleveland High School...
0,139,42,CHLOE,What?
0,139,42,FELGER,"Chemistry 201...I had an incident with my mid-term lab...they got the fire under control in about an hour...poor Mr. Hoffman - his eyebrows never grew back. I should have got out of science right then and there...you know, but this would save everybody all the trouble..."
0,139,42,CHLOE,This is Stargate Command. You wouldn't be here... ...if you weren't very good at what you do.
0,139,42,FELGER,You tell that to Colonel O'Neill...
0,139,42,CARTER,
0,139,42,FELGER,How many teams came back?
0,139,42,CARTER,Three.
0,139,42,CHLOE,Out of how many?
0,139,42,CARTER,15. The rest are stranded.
0,139,42,FELGER,And Dr. Jackson?
0,139,42,CARTER,His team's still off-world.
0,139,42,FELGER,Oh...this is awful!
0,139,42,CARTER,"The flood waters are rising, but they're safe...for the time being."
0,139,43,CARTER,Carter. General.
0,139,43,FELGER,Oh...General...
0,139,43,CARTER,"Yes, sir. I understand. We contacted the Tok'ra. According to their intelligence...the entire 'gate network is down."
0,139,45,HAMMOND,"Colonel O'Neill, report."
0,139,45,O'NEILL,"The mission's been compromised, sir. Looks like one of the Jaffa commanders sold us out. Go figure."
0,139,46,HAMMOND,What happened?
0,139,46,O'NEILL,"The negotiations were going just fine...then the 'gate broke down. After that, they all started accusing each other of sabotage and all hell broke loose."
0,139,46,CARTER,"Sir, we think we know what caused your 'gate to malfunction. It was the virus."
0,139,46,O'NEILL,Felger's virus?!
0,139,46,CARTER,"It created a new coordinate system that then spread to all the DHDs, but, since we don't have a DHD, we have the only 'gate that can dial out."
0,139,46,O'NEILL,I told you not to trust that brown-nosing little weasel!
0,139,46,FELGER,"He doesn't know I'm standing here, does he?"
0,139,46,CARTER,"Sir, I'm just as responsible as anyone else."
0,139,47,TEAL'C,O'Neill...
0,139,47,O'NEILL,"We've got incoming, sir! It's Alkesh..."
0,139,48,DAVIS,We just lost video.
0,139,48,CARTER,They must have hit the MALP.
0,139,48,FELGER,He was just standing a few feet from it.
0,139,48,HAMMOND,"Colonel O'Neill, what's your situation? Please respond."
0,139,49,O'NEILL,"We're still in one piece, sir."
0,139,49,FELGER,"Oh, thank God."
0,139,49,O'NEILL,"We're gonna take cover, sir."
0,139,49,CARTER,"Sir, we still have an outgoing wormhole. We could send reinforcements..."
0,139,49,HAMMOND,They'd be stranded like all the others. I can't send anyone until we fix this problem.
0,139,50,CARTER,"Let's think this through, logically. The entire 'gate network has been paralyzed, but we can still dial out."
0,139,50,FELGER,And we're assuming that the virus was spread as a result of the correlative updates initiated by the DHDs.
0,139,50,CHLOE,"We don't have a DHD, so our 'gate was unaffected."
0,139,50,CARTER,Right. It also means another change would probably result in another system-wide update.
0,139,50,FELGER,"So, if we can get just one DHD converted back to the old coordinate system, the 'gate network would spread it for us."
0,139,50,CARTER,"But how do you convert back to the old system, when the new one is based on a completely random principal?"
0,139,50,FELGER,"There still has to be a pattern. I mean, if we can get one DHD to establish a lock with a specific 'gate, then all we have to do is compare that old address to the new address and extrapolate a translation program...yeah..."
0,139,50,CARTER,That would mean random dialing...
0,139,50,CHLOE,Seven symbols chose from a pool of 38 non-repeating candidates? That's about 63 billion possible combinations.
0,139,50,FELGER,She's good with numbers. I was going to get her to do my taxes.
0,139,52,CARTER,"Any word from Colonel O'Neill, sir?"
0,139,52,HAMMOND,"No, we've been unable to reestablish contact. We hope he's just out of range."
0,139,52,CARTER,"Yes, sir."
0,139,52,HAMMOND,"According to our latest intelligence report, it looks like Ba'al is trying to take advantage of the situation."
0,139,52,CARTER,How so?
0,139,52,HAMMOND,"At the moment, he has the largest fleet."
0,139,52,CARTER,"With the 'gate system down, whoever has the most ships has the advantage."
0,139,52,HAMMOND,He's attacking the other system lords on several fronts. And he's winning.
0,139,53,FELGER,"Stargate Command, Felger speaking. Mom, mom, no - no, no...no, I told you not to call me here. No, you're not even supposed to have this number...I'm sorry I didn't call, I had to work late, something came up...If you must know, mom, I-I screwed up again. Yeah, and I think this is the worst one yet. No, no...it-it's worse than that one. No, worse than that one too, mom. Mom, mom, mom, I don't need a list of my personal failures right now, okay? I mean, to tell you the truth, mom, I don't even know if I can fix this one... I'll have to get back to you on that then, Simon, okay? Alrighty, then, bye-bye. A friend, it's Coombs...he says hi."
0,139,53,CARTER,"Look, Jay...I-I know you feel bad about this."
0,139,53,FELGER,"What's to feel bad about? I mean, it probably took the ancients a thousand years to build the 'gate system, and I... ...wrecked it in a single day. Not to mention the fact that I've isolated us from all the off-world resources we're going to need to defend ourselves, leaving us sitting ducks for the next Goa'uld attack. But who cares?"
0,139,53,CARTER,Look I-I need you to get past feeling guilty and focus on finding a solution.
0,139,53,FELGER,That's easy for you to say 'cause you never make mistakes.
0,139,53,CARTER,I don't?
0,139,53,FELGER,"Oh, com on...you're perfect. Everybody knows that."
0,139,53,CARTER,Jay...I'm not perfect.
0,139,53,FELGER,"See, you have to say that because you're modest...which is just another aspect of your perfection."
0,139,53,CARTER,Have you ever heard of a planet called K'Tau?
0,139,53,FELGER,That wasn't your fault.
0,139,53,CARTER,I was the one who bypassed the dialing protocols that cause the wormhole to pass through K'Tau's sun. The chain reaction that resulted could have led to the deaths of everyone on that planet...
0,139,54,FELGER,That's it! That's it! That's it! Oh...even your mistakes are perfect.
0,139,54,CARTER,What are you talking about?
0,139,54,FELGER,You were able to bypass the security protocol because you created your own dialing program...
0,139,54,CARTER,So?
0,139,54,FELGER,"So, we can do that here. Instead of trying to tweak the DHD program back to it's original form, why don't we just upload everything from our dialing computer?"
0,139,54,CARTER,Our program is nowhere near as sophisticated as the one that exists in the DHDs. It's completely jerry-rigged.
0,139,54,FELGER,"It doesn't have to be perfect, as long as the coordinate system is accurate. The DHD will automatically make all the necessary adjustments."
0,139,54,CARTER,How do you know that?
0,139,54,FELGER,"Well, it's...okay, I don't. I don't. I don't. But the fact that Avenger triggered a correlative update seems to indicate that the DHD program is adaptive by it's very nature...and plus...we have nothing else. Trust me, Major, this is gonna work."
0,139,55,JACKSON,"Yeah, sorry to rain on your parade guys, but it didn't work."
0,139,56,FELGER,It should have worked.
0,139,56,JACKSON,"We tried dialing Earth and the Alpha Site, but we couldn't get a lock."
0,139,56,FELGER,"You know, maybe there's something wrong with the upload... ...you can upload better, huh?"
0,139,56,JACKSON,"If you've got any other bright ideas, now would be a very good time."
0,139,56,HAMMOND,"What's your status, Doctor?"
0,139,56,JACKSON,"Flood water's rising pretty fast and seismic activity is causing a lot of rogue waves. We estimate that within 48 hours, the entire city will be under water."
0,139,56,FELGER,It should have worked!
0,139,57,HAMMOND,Have you and Dr. Felger made any progress?
0,139,57,CARTER,I can't find him.
0,139,57,HAMMOND,Excuse me?
0,139,57,CARTER,"Apparently, Dr. Felger has left the base. I-I think the pressure was getting to him."
0,139,57,HAMMOND,I thought you said all he needed was a little support...
0,139,57,CARTER,"Yeah...I may have been wrong about that. Okay...I admit it. He's a complete screw-up. He makes rash decisions based on sketchy evidence, he's clumsy in the lab, he's always late and...quite frankly, it wouldn't kill him to ease up on the after- shave, but the fact is, sir...he's at Stargate Command because he's a brilliant scientist. And no one understands that virus better than he does..."
0,139,57,HAMMOND,"Then, I suggest you get him back."
0,139,57,CARTER,"Yes, sir."
0,139,58,CARTER,"Jay, what're you doing out here? We've got work to do."
0,139,58,FELGER,How did you find me here?
0,139,58,CARTER,I called your mother. She told me this is where you come when you need to think.
0,139,58,FELGER,"This is the very spot I was standing when I figured out how to recombine epsilon particles in a sub-space matrix... Then I got mugged by some teenagers. Still, it's a nice spot."
0,139,58,CARTER,What are you doing?
0,139,58,FELGER,Feeding the ducks.
0,139,59,CARTER,I need you to come back to Stargate Command.
0,139,59,FELGER,"You know, before I joined SGC...my idea of a high- pressure situation was defending a mathematical thesis in front of a room full of balding, middle-aged men. I don't do so well when the fate of the universe is hanging in the balance now."
0,139,59,CARTER,"Jay, you designed the virus. You're the man for the job. Forget about the big picture for a second. Forget about the consequences. Just focus on the problem. Why didn't the upload work?"
0,139,59,FELGER,I don't know. It should've. Every 'gate in the galaxy should be back on-line. Except for P5S-117.
0,139,59,CARTER,What do you mean?
0,139,59,FELGER,"Well, Avenger's resistant to that type of tampering, you know? And I didn't think it made much difference since S-117 was sabotaged in the first place."
0,139,59,CARTER,"Jay, what if the virus replicated itself and then traveled along with the new coordinate system to the other DHDs?"
0,139,59,FELGER,"No, that's impossible. It wasn't designed to do that."
0,139,59,CARTER,"Well, it wasn't designed to trigger a correlative update, either. You said it yourself, Jay. The DHD program is adaptive."
0,139,60,CARTER,"Sir, we think we may have found a solution."
0,139,60,HAMMOND,Let's hear it.
0,139,61,FELGER,Y-you want me to tell it?
0,139,61,CARTER,It's your project.
0,139,62,FELGER,"Well, General, we think we know why we were unable to upload a dialing program into the 'gate system. It now looks as though the virus itself, somehow, transmitted along with the new coordinate system to the entire DHD network."
0,139,62,HAMMOND,The virus is blocking the upload.
0,139,62,FELGER,"That's right. That's right and we need to neutralize it first. But in order to do that, we have to find it."
0,139,62,HAMMOND,I don't understand.
0,139,62,FELGER,"W-w-well, uh, the truth is, uh, we don't know how the virus was transmitted. If it piggybacked with the automatic correlative update, that means it's buried somewhere within the dialing program itself. We're talking thousands of lines of code...you know, it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack."
0,139,62,CARTER,"But we do know that the virus exists within a very specific sub-routine of the original target DHD on P5S-117. The catch is, in order to make this work, we have to reboot the system which means removing the control crystal. Someone's going to have to physically go to the planet, sir."
0,139,62,HAMMOND,
0,139,62,CARTER,"Yes, sir."
0,139,62,FELGER,General... I'd like to volunteer.
0,139,62,HAMMOND,Major Carter has the experience required for this mission.
0,139,62,FELGER,"Oh, come on...I've got off-world experience. I battled the Goa'uld. I zatted a Jaffa."
0,139,62,CARTER,"Sir, maybe it would be better if we both went."
0,139,62,FELGER,Major Carter's right. Nobody knows more about Avenger than me.
0,139,63,CHLOE,"Jay, this is crazy."
0,139,63,FELGER,"Look, I caused this problem, I'm gonna fix it."
0,139,63,CHLOE,"You're a research scientist, not a field operative."
0,139,63,FELGER,"Did that stop me from infiltrating a Goa'uld mothership? I think not. Look, they've already sent the MALP. The 'gates not even being guarded. Probably, because it doesn't work any more, but don't worry about me."
0,139,64,FELGER,"I know what I'm doing, okay?"
0,139,65,CHLOE,Jay... ...the anti-virus.
0,139,65,FELGER,"Okay, yeah...yeah, yeah, I'm gonna need that. Alrighty."
0,139,66,FELGER,What?
0,139,67,FELGER,What...what was that for?
0,139,67,CHLOE,Good luck.
0,139,67,FELGER,Oh...right.
0,139,69,CARTER,"All right, you get set up. I'll be back in a few minutes."
0,139,69,FELGER,Where're you going?
0,139,69,CARTER,I'm gonna to check out the area.
0,139,69,FELGER,"Shouldn't we stick together? You know, in case you need back up or something?"
0,139,69,CARTER,I'll be fine.
0,139,69,FELGER,Okay...I'm good too.
0,139,71,O'NEILL,The Jaffa landed the Alkesh and they're sending out search patrols. Teal'c and I have organized the rebels for a counter attack.
0,139,71,HAMMOND,"Be advised, Colonel. Major Carter has gone to P5S-117. She's attempting to get the 'gate system back on line."
0,139,71,O'NEILL,"That's occupied territory, sir."
0,139,71,HAMMOND,"Yes, it is."
0,139,71,O'NEILL,What team did she take?
0,139,71,HAMMOND,Major Carter didn't want to risk stranding anyone else.
0,139,71,O'NEILL,She went alone?
0,139,71,HAMMOND,Not entirely...Dr. Felger's with her.
0,139,71,O'NEILL,I'm inspired with confidence.
0,139,72,CARTER,There's no sign of any Jaffa activity in the area.
0,139,72,FELGER,"I'm in. I'm in. Whoo... Just a sec, just a sec...okay...something's wrong."
0,139,72,CARTER,What?
0,139,72,FELGER,"This isn't Avenger. I mean, it's Avenger, but s-something's hinky. It's been altered."
0,139,72,CARTER,Hinky?
0,139,72,FELGER,"The point is, this isn't the program I wrote. I-it's been tampered with since it was sent."
0,139,72,CARTER,Maybe it was Ba'al.
0,139,72,FELGER,Ba'al?
0,139,72,CARTER,"Think about it. He stood the most to gain. He took your idea your idea to bring down one 'gate and modified it to bring down the entire 'gate network, knowing it would give him an advantage."
0,139,72,FELGER,"Huh...well, that means none of this was my fault. I told you Avenger wasn't designed to cause a correlative update."
0,139,72,CARTER,I wouldn't get too excited. It also means our anti-virus isn't going to work.
0,139,72,FELGER,That's right. It's designed for the original program.
0,139,72,CARTER,Which means that we are now stranded on a Goa'uld occupied world.
0,139,72,FELGER,So it's kind of a good news-bad news situation...
0,139,73,CARTER,"The Jaffa probably aren't as protective of the 'gate as they once were, but sooner or later, there's going to be a patrol. We have to do something."
0,139,73,FELGER,"Well, I'm open to suggestions..."
0,139,73,CARTER,"You said the virus was modified, right? So all we need to do is modify the anti-virus to match it."
0,139,73,FELGER,"Okay, go for it."
0,139,74,CARTER,I was hoping you could handle it.
0,139,75,FELGER,"Oh, I was afraid you were going to say that."
0,139,75,CARTER,You wanna do this instead?
0,139,75,FELGER,Do you know how many variations I went through before I got the anti-virus right? And that was when I knew what I was up against. This could take days.
0,139,75,CARTER,"Well, then you'd better get started."
0,139,75,FELGER,"Yep...oh, yeah..."
0,139,76,JACKSON,Still no word from Sam?
0,139,76,HAMMOND,To be honest...we should've heard back by now.
0,139,76,JACKSON,"Well, we're gonna have to abandon the Stargate and move to higher ground."
0,139,76,HAMMOND,"Very well. Good luck, Dr. Jackson."
0,139,77,CARTER,How's it coming?
0,139,77,FELGER,"We're getting there. It's pretty cool, isn't it? You and I working together? We're sort of like the intellectual Butch and Sundance of the SGC."
0,139,77,CARTER,Butch and Sundance got cornered and killed by the Bolivian army.
0,139,77,FELGER,"Yeah...that's a good point, yeah."
0,139,78,FELGER,What? What? What? What?
0,139,78,CARTER,We got trouble.
0,139,78,FELGER,Wh-what kind of trouble? What?
0,139,78,CARTER,Think Bolivia.
0,139,78,FELGER,Ah...Jaffa.
0,139,79,CARTER,They've made our position. Keep working.
0,139,80,FELGER,Oh...
0,139,81,FELGER,"Concentrate, Jay...concentrate. Just background noise."
0,139,82,CARTER,How's it coming?
0,139,82,FELGER,I'm feeling a little rushed. There's not enough time. There's not enough time.
0,139,83,FELGER,Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa
0,139,84,FELGER,"O'Neill. Look, it's Colonel O'Neill! Thank God! Oh, Colonel O'Neill, you wouldn't believe, you would not...thank God it's you..."
0,139,84,O'NEILL,Felger...Felger. Felger! What did I say about touching?
0,139,84,FELGER,"Absolutely, absolutely, it's just that we were over there, you know, and then they came...everywhere...and th-those guys...then you...over there... ...but now you're here. Now you're here. Nice one."
0,139,84,CARTER,"How'd you manage this one, sir?"
0,139,84,O'NEILL,We got tired of waiting.
0,139,86,HAMMOND,"Major, Doctor, welcome back."
0,139,86,CARTER,Sir.
0,139,86,HAMMOND,I trust the solution you came up with is of a permanent nature?
0,139,86,FELGER,"Oh, yes, yes...not to worry, General. I've modified the anti-virus, you know, specifically to target and neutralize the altered version of Avenger. But I've also added a little patch, you know, just to ensure that no one will ever..."
0,139,86,CARTER,"The problem is solved, sir...permanently."
0,139,86,HAMMOND,Dr. Jackson managed to get the remaining inhabitants of 997 through to the Alpha Site.
0,139,86,CARTER,"Good to hear it, sir."
0,139,86,HAMMOND,What about Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c?
0,139,86,CARTER,They found an alternate means of transport. I promised the Colonel I wouldn't say anything...want's it to be a surprise.
0,139,88,CHLOE,I was so worried about you.
0,139,88,FELGER,It was no big deal.
0,139,89,FELGER,"Not a chance, Baby."
0,139,90,CARTER,What is this?
0,139,90,FELGER,"Oh... Hi, guys. I know, we're not really supposed to be...fraternizing, but, hey..."
0,139,90,CARTER,I turn my back for two seconds and you take up with this...trollop?
0,139,90,FELGER,Oooh... He puts his hands up as Chloe begins moving toward Sam.
0,139,90,CHLOE,Don't blame me just because you were never woman enough to satisfy him.
0,139,90,CARTER,Ohhh... That's it.
0,139,91,FELGER,"Whoa...ladies, please, no this isn't really necessary..."
0,139,91,O'NEILL,Shhhh! Don't talk.
0,139,92,CHLOE,Jay...Jay? Jay...
0,139,92,FELGER,What? What?
0,139,92,CHLOE,What were you thinking about?
0,139,92,FELGER,Nothing.
