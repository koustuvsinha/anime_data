0,141,0,"""EVOLUTION I""",By Damian Kindler
0,141,1,TEAL'C,These warriors are of both Ramius and Tilgath.
0,141,1,BRA'TAC,This meeting did not go well.
0,141,1,TEAL'C,Some of these warriors have been shot in the back. They were killed while retreating.
0,141,1,BRA'TAC,There was no honor in this battle.
0,141,1,TEAL'C,Ramius must have betrayed his allegiance.
0,141,1,BRA'TAC,The first prime of Ramius.
0,141,2,BRA'TAC,He is alive.
0,141,2,FIRST PRIME,You must go from this place.
0,141,2,BRA'TAC,Why did your master betray Tilgath? Speak.
0,141,2,FIRST PRIME,We came to forge an alliance. My master did not do this. He barely escaped alive.
0,141,2,TEAL'C,Then what happened here?
0,141,2,FIRST PRIME,One warrior...
0,141,6,HAMMOND,What the hell happened out there?
0,141,6,TEAL'C,"Our intelligence was indeed correct. The summit between Ramius and Tilgath did take place. However when we had arrived, Ramius had already fled."
0,141,6,BRA'TAC,"All those men had been slain, including Tilgath."
0,141,6,HAMMOND,By this one man alone?
0,141,6,BRA'TAC,"From the way he fought us, I do not doubt it."
0,141,6,HAMMOND,An Ashrak?
0,141,6,TEAL'C,He was unlike any warrior we have previously encountered.
0,141,6,JACKSON,"Obviously, you were able to take him down."
0,141,6,TEAL'C,He withstood the brunt of our weapons fire before finally succumbing.
0,141,6,CARTER,Its armor must protect it from energy based weapons. If that's the case then we could be dealing with an entirely new kind of technology.
0,141,6,JACKSON,And we believe that this wasn't an attempt by Ramius to kill Tilgath?
0,141,6,BRA'TAC,Ramius' Jaffa were equally decimated. His first prime said his master barely escaped alive.
0,141,6,JACKSON,"So, obviously, someone found out about the alliance and wanted to stop it."
0,141,6,HAMMOND,"Major, run whatever tests you have to."
0,141,6,CARTER,"I'd like to call the Tok'ra in on this one, sir, with your permission."
0,141,6,HAMMOND,Do it. I want to know everything we can about this warrior.
0,141,7,CARTER,The suit must be affecting the MRI.
0,141,7,JACOB,"As long as he is wearing that armor, we're not going to learn anything more."
0,141,8,CARTER,This helmet is made up of two pieces. Pass me those forceps.
0,141,9,CARTER,Looks like he's fused right into the suit.
0,141,9,JACOB,Some sort of breathing filtration system.
0,141,10,CARTER,"It's a Goa'uld. Quite frankly, that's not as shocking as the host."
0,141,10,HAMMOND,How so?
0,141,10,CARTER,It has an incredibly unusual organ structure.
0,141,10,JACOB,"Everything's out of proportion. Physiologically, the heart and lungs had to be abnormally large to supply enough blood and oxygen to its muscles. Basically, it's like someone tried to genetically engineer the perfect athlete without any concern for longevity."
0,141,10,TEAL'C,Leaving it to the symbiote to sustain its life.
0,141,10,JACKSON,An engineered host.
0,141,10,JACOB,"A seriously flawed one. Even a Goa'uld symbiote wouldn't be able to compensate for long. We're still in the process of analyzing genetic data, but for now we can tell you...there was no evident trauma from energy weapons."
0,141,10,HAMMOND,What does that mean?
0,141,10,CARTER,"The warriors armor seems to possess some sort of advances energy absorption technology. If it works the way I think it does, it wouldn't matter how many staff or zat blasts were fired at it. Nothing would get through."
0,141,10,HAMMOND,Are you suggesting that Teal'c and Bra'tac didn't kill this Goa'uld?
0,141,10,CARTER,"Yes, sir. Apparently, the host was on the verge of a pulmonary failure long before it encountered them."
0,141,10,HAMMOND,It had a heart attack?
0,141,10,CARTER,"Sorry, Teal'c. You didn't stop it. You and Bra'tac just got lucky."
0,141,11,JACOB,"It's entire cellular structure is less then three weeks old. It is organic, but it was definitely created in a lab."
0,141,11,CARTER,"Well, we know that the Goa'uld have been trying to physically perfect a host that would be superior to humans."
0,141,11,JACOB,Well this thing's definitely a lot stronger than humans but it's far from superior.
0,141,11,JACKSON,Traditionally. the Goa'uld are also somewhat vain about their appearance.
0,141,11,JACOB,This was obviously intended to be a new form of foot soldier...possibly a reaction to the recent uprising of the Jaffa. What's most interesting is that this being was not alive when it was first grown. It was given life after it reached its mature state.
0,141,11,JACKSON,Frankenstein's monster.
0,141,11,CARTER,How do you know that?
0,141,11,SELMAK,Remnants of a unique energy signature within its cells. It's similar to the residual effects left by the use of a sarcophagus.
0,141,11,JACKSON,Could it give life to something that wasn't alive in the first place?
0,141,11,SELMAK,"No the sarcophagus is designed to boost health and longevity, heal or revive someone terminally injured. They are nowhere near powerful enough to animate non-living cellular matter."
0,141,11,CARTER,Then what could have?
0,141,11,SELMAK,"Thousands of years ago a Goa'uld found a device originally created by the Ancients. They determined its primary purpose was to heal. But it was so powerful, it's effects on human hosts ultimately proved devastating. However, after much research and experimentation, the Goa'uld was able to use the technology to create the first sarcophagus."
0,141,11,JACKSON,Obviously he wasn't able to eliminate all of its negative side effects.
0,141,11,SELMAK,"The Tok'ra have long sought this device in the hope of using it to perfect the sarcophagus technology so that we could all benefit from it. Now, it may be the key to fighting this new warrior."
0,141,11,CARTER,How?
0,141,11,SELMAK,With the device we may be able to devise a weapon to counteract this life giving energy.
0,141,11,JACKSON,Who was the first Goa'uld to find the device?
0,141,11,SELMAK,His name was Telchak.
0,141,11,JACKSON,Telchak...
0,141,12,JACKSON,"Nicholas Ballard, my, uh...Grandfather. One of Nick's early obsessions was finding the so-called fountain of youth. Uh, he claimed he found evidence indicating the source of the fountains power was a piece of...alien technology used by early Mayan tribes around 900 BC. They traced its origins to Chac, the Mayan god of rain."
0,141,12,JACOB,And you think this Chac may have actually been Telchak?
0,141,12,JACKSON,Just a hunch.
0,141,12,CARTER,Maybe not just a hunch. The primary function of the device was to heal right?
0,141,12,JACOB,For the Ancients. For Humans to see any positive effect it would be from very limited exposure at a safe distance.
0,141,12,CARTER,Still if the device was kept hidden near a water source it could be the basis for the fountain of youth mythology.
0,141,12,JACKSON,Nick believed Chac's temple was located somewhere in Central America. He spent decades of his life searching for it but came up empty. I've been over his notes and most of it is indecipherable. The only mention of the temples location is somewhere near a waterfall in a river.
0,141,13,JACOB,This is written in an obscure dialect of Goa'uld.
0,141,14,HAMMOND,So where is it?
0,141,14,JACKSON,"It's here. I-If Selmak's right, Telchak's temple is in Southern Honduras."
0,141,14,HAMMOND,How can we be certain the device is there?
0,141,14,JACKSON,"Uh...we can't, but, um..."
0,141,14,CARTER,We think we know who's responsible for creating the Goa'uld warrior.
0,141,14,HAMMOND,Telchak?
0,141,14,JACKSON,No.
0,141,14,SELMAK,"After Telchak created the sarcophagus, Anubis went to war with him for possession of the original Ancient device."
0,141,14,JACKSON,"That was long ago, before Anubis attempted to ascend."
0,141,14,SELMAK,"Anubis defeated Telchak, but he never did find the device. It was believed to be hidden in one of Telchak's many temples."
0,141,14,HAMMOND,You think Anubis is behind this.
0,141,14,CARTER,He knew about the technology. While he never actually found the device he ultimately wouldn't need to.
0,141,14,JACKSON,He would have gained access to the knowledge when he ascended. He could have built himself a new one.
0,141,14,HAMMOND,Still it's only a guess.
0,141,14,JACKSON,Yeah... and SELMAK : Yes.
0,141,14,JACKSON,But it's a good one.
0,141,14,CARTER,"The good news is, sir, the original Ancients device is most probably still here on Earth."
0,141,14,SELMAK,If we could analyze the technology of this device it might be possible to engineer a weapon we can use against these warriors.
0,141,14,CARTER,Not to mention the possibility of harnessing its power to heal.
0,141,14,HAMMOND,"Very well. Dr. Jackson, take Dr. Lee and see what you can find. Dismissed."
0,141,15,LEE,Are you sure this is the right place?
0,141,15,JACKSON,This is where he said he'd be.
0,141,15,LEE,What if he doesn't show up?
0,141,15,JACKSON,"Well, we have a few beers...make a few friends..."
0,141,16,{*NOTE,Please excuse the transcription here. I do not speak or read Spanish. I am taking this strictly from the CC.}
0,141,16,ROGELIO,"Hola, muy Buenos días, caballeros. Un cerveza? Un tequila?"
0,141,16,JACKSON,"Um, de hecho. Estamos buscando a un guía llamado Rogelio, El quedó de vernos aquí."
0,141,16,ROGELIO,"Pedro, haste cargo, tio! I am Rogelio, Rogelio Duran at your service. This is just my day job. You must be Dr. Jackson."
0,141,16,JACKSON,"That's right. Uh, this is Dr. Lee."
0,141,16,LEE,Buenos Días.
0,141,16,ROGELIO,Encantado. So...you guys wanna see some temples?
0,141,16,JACKSON,"Actually, we wanna see one temple in particular."
0,141,17,JACKSON,Here.
0,141,17,ROGELIO,"I'm sorry to tell you this, Señor, but there are no temples there. What you wanna do is go North. That's where all the good stuff is. There's lots of ruins. My cousin has a truck. We could be there in five hours."
0,141,17,JACKSON,Yeah. I'm sure the North is great but we really wanna go here.
0,141,17,ROGELIO,"Señor, I've been to this part of the country many times. There is nothing there, I promise you. North! That's where you wanna go. Trust me."
0,141,17,JACKSON,Look either you take us South or we'll find someone who will.
0,141,17,ROGELIO,"Uh, okay, okay, okay...it's your money."
0,141,17,JACKSON,So you say your cousin has a truck?
0,141,17,ROGELIO,Simón. His house is just around the corner. Of course there is the issue of filling the tank with gas.
0,141,18,ROGELIO,"Okay, now we're talking business. Let's go gentlemen."
0,141,19,LEE,"Uh...look, I-I need a receipt or something. I gotta fill in the paper..."
0,141,21,BRA'TAC,"If Anubis is truly behind this, then his strategy is to assassinate any minor Goa'ulds vulnerable to attack, absorbing their troops and resources in preparation for battle with Ba'al and the System Lords."
0,141,21,HAMMOND,How many more of these so called minor Goa'ulds have suffered attacks?
0,141,21,BRA'TAC,At least three. These new warriors are devastating.
0,141,21,HAMMOND,Do we have any idea where they're coming from?
0,141,21,BRA'TAC,No.
0,141,21,HAMMOND,Our fear is it's only a matter of time before Anubis targets Earth.
0,141,21,BRA'TAC,These beings are a threat to all who hope to one day see the Goa'uld wither in defeat.
0,141,21,HAMMOND,If Dr. Jackson can recover this Ancient device...
0,141,21,BRA'TAC,"Even if he does, there is no guarantee the Tok'ra can devise a weapon capable of fending off these warriors."
0,141,21,CARTER,We were only able to learn a limited amount from our study of the dead warrior and it's armor.
0,141,21,TEAL'C,The only way to learn more is through interrogation.
0,141,21,CARTER,Which means we have to capture one alive.
0,141,22,HAMMOND,"What have we got, Major?"
0,141,22,CARTER,"The warrior's armor is able to resist our strongest armor piercing weapons, as well as absorb energy weapon fire. However, we've discovered that the material is made up of a close-knit fiber that's very similar to Kevlar. Meaning, something small and sharp should be able to penetrate it...such as a fine-tipped Trinium dart."
0,141,24,CARTER,"According to Bra'tac the fact that this Ramius is still alive makes him a likely target. Now, there are enough rebel Jaffa under his command that gaining access to the planet shouldn't be a problem. The plan is to stake out the Stargate on Ramius' planet and capture one of the warriors when it comes through."
0,141,25,O'NEILL,What if one doesn't come through?
0,141,25,CARTER,"Well...we come home, I suppose. However, let's say Bra'tac is right. We meet his contacts on Ramius' planet and set up an ambush using a Tok'ra forcefield to trap the warrior and then hit it with Trinium tranquilizers."
0,141,25,O'NEILL,How does the dart get through the shield?
0,141,25,CARTER,They work one way. They keep things in not out.
0,141,25,O'NEILL,Ah...
0,141,26,CARTER,So what do you think?
0,141,26,O'NEILL,I have some notes.
0,141,28,LEE,"According to the map we're in the right place but, uh..."
0,141,28,JACKSON,This makes no sense. The legend of the fountain of youth says that all nearby water flows towards it.
0,141,28,LEE,"Well, how's that possible?"
0,141,28,JACKSON,Well maybe the device has special properties or maybe its just superstition or maybe it means that the water from that waterfall back there flows in the direction of the temple.
0,141,28,LEE,"Well it should be right here, but, uh..."
0,141,28,R,"Nobody ever listens to me, man. I tell them there are no temples out here but what do they do? They come out here anyways. Now the North...the North has roads. We could drive to any temple we want but instead we're out here walking through this jungle."
0,141,28,JACKSON,"Yeah, okay. Let's spread out, look for a...temple. In lieu of that, look for a...totem or marker of some kind. Anything that might tell us where to go from here."
0,141,29,JACKSON,Go.
0,141,30,LEE,Waaa... Found it!
0,141,31,ADAL,I believe this is the best spot to set up for your ambush. This path leads directly to the pyramid of Ramius. I will go now to ensure that your eventual escape will be undetected.
0,141,31,BRA'TAC,Brother. They grasp arms in a traditional Jaffa manner.
0,141,31,ADAL,"Tek ma te, Master Bra'tac. It is an honor to be in your service."
0,141,31,BRA'TAC,"Many thanks, Adal. Chal-nak."
0,141,31,O'NEILL,"All right, Carter, do your thing. Reynolds, I want flanking positions set up on either side of the clearing."
0,141,31,REYNOLDS,Roger that.
0,141,31,O'NEILL,Ring the perimeter with C4.
0,141,31,REYNOLDS,Not much faith in plan A?
0,141,31,O'NEILL,Since when has plan A ever worked?
0,141,31,REYNOLDS,Right.
0,141,33,JACKSON,You okay?
0,141,33,LEE,"Yeah, I'm fine. At least you were right about there being something here."
0,141,33,JACKSON,"Listen we're gonna go look around, stay put."
0,141,33,ROGELIO,"You got it, Señor. Have fun."
0,141,34,JACKSON,This is definitely early Mayan stonework.
0,141,34,LEE,"Oh, yeah."
0,141,35,O'NEILL,
0,141,35,SG-3 LEADER,"We're maintaining position. Stargate is secure, there's no activity."
0,141,35,O'NEILL,Maybe we should start a pool.
0,141,36,LEE,"Is this cramped thing getting to you? I-I mean, why would they make these passageways so narrow?"
0,141,36,JACKSON,Maybe they were skinny people.
0,141,36,LEE,"And the roof too. Ow, my head...God!"
0,141,36,JACKSON,"Skinny, short people."
0,141,37,LEE,It's a dead end.
0,141,37,JACKSON,"There's no other passageway, nothing on the walls or ceiling. No glyphs, no seals, no ancient script. Not even a pictograph."
0,141,37,LEE,Isn't there always writing?
0,141,38,LEE,"You know, I mean, somewhere, there's bound to be...maybe not."
0,141,39,SG-3 LEADER,
0,141,39,O'NEILL,"All right, heads up."
0,141,40,O'NEILL,Do it!
0,141,41,O'NEILL,Carter?
0,141,41,CARTER,"I don't understand, sir."
0,141,41,O'NEILL,Hit him again?
0,141,41,CARTER,A third dart could kill him. We want him alive.
0,141,42,O'NEILL,Son of a bitch.
0,141,45,O'NEILL,Fire in the hole!
0,141,46,C4!,
0,141,47,CARTER,"Sir, our position's been made."
0,141,47,O'NEILL,"All right, grab the wounded and saddle up. SG3 sierra, dial the 'gate. We're aborting the mission."
0,141,47,SG-3 LEADER,"Negative, SG1. We have major unfriendly Jaffa closing in on our position. We cannot hold the 'gate. Repeat, Stargate is not secure."
0,141,47,BRA'TAC,"Soon we will be surrounded. If we fight, many more will die."
0,141,47,O'NEILL,What do you wanna do?
0,141,47,BRA'TAC,Surrender. There is a chance Adal and his rebel Jaffa can free us later.
0,141,49,ROGELIO,"Dr. Jackson, Dr. Lee..."
0,141,49,JACKSON,"Yeah, we're here. We, uh, found a chamber. Gonna be a while."
0,141,49,ROGELIO,"Ah...take your time, Señor."
0,141,49,JACKSON,"Well, we're paying him by the hour."
0,141,49,LEE,I don't understand. How are we supposed to find this thing if there is no writing?
0,141,49,JACKSON,All water flows towards it.
0,141,49,LEE,So?
0,141,49,JACKSON,Give me your canteen. Here hold this.
0,141,50,LEE,What good's that gonna do?
0,141,51,JACKSON,There's something under here.
0,141,51,LEE,Your good. Ramius' Planet The surrendered SG personnel and rebel Jaffa have been taken to a holding cell in the pyramid. Jack is pacing. Sam is looking after Reynolds. Others are just standing around. There are Jaffa guarding them.
0,141,51,O'NEILL,How's he doing?
0,141,51,CARTER,He's stable for now but we've gotta get him outta here soon.
0,141,51,REYNOLDS,I'm fine.
0,141,51,RAMIUS,Jaffa!
0,141,51,O'NEILL,"I'll handle this. Greetings! Well, uh, I know how this looks. So, I think it's important we clear up any misunderstanding right away. We did not come to kill you. Honest. Am I right!? The fact is, and this is the fun part, we actually came to save your ass...es, all your asses. Do you see the irony? All right, there's this guy out there...big guy...big guy in a black suit, none to fond of you Goa'ulds. Well, anyway, he's the one we're after, not you. So if you wanna let us go, we'll be on our way, to save the world another day...you're not buying this are you?"
0,141,51,RAMIUS,Jaffa! Kree!
0,141,52,CARTER,Well...that went well.
0,141,52,O'NEILL,That went well.
0,141,53,LEE,"Well, at least it has writing on it."
0,141,53,JACKSON,Yeah...
0,141,53,LEE,What's it say?
0,141,53,JACKSON,I have no idea.
0,141,53,LEE,Oh...
0,141,54,JACKSON,"Careful! Uhm, It's the root technology of a Sarcophagus...which, by itself, causes madness and addiction. This is, supposedly, something far more powerful. So accidentally activating it would be bad."
0,141,54,LEE,Okay...
0,141,54,JACKSON,Let's just try picking it up without...touching it too much.
0,141,55,JACKSON,I think running would be a good idea right about now...
0,141,56,ROGELIO,"Dr. Jackson, can you hear me?"
0,141,57,BRA'TAC,Your friend's condition worsens.
0,141,57,O'NEILL,"Yeah, well, your friends could show up any time now."
0,141,57,BRA'TAC,We must consider that they may not.
0,141,57,O'NEILL,Really?
0,141,57,BRA'TAC,At least we are alive.
0,141,57,O'NEILL,Yes...if you call this living.
0,141,57,CARTER,Your worried that the super soldier will kill Ramius and then just slaughter the rest of us.
0,141,57,O'NEILL,Super Soldier?
0,141,57,CARTER,No?
0,141,57,O'NEILL,It has a ring.
0,141,57,TEAL'C,"Most likely the warrior was only after Ramius. When we attacked, its only concern was escape so that the mission may be completed."
0,141,57,O'NEILL,So what? We just sit around while Ramius gets whacked? Then what?
0,141,58,O'NEILL,"Hey...hey, what? A little conversation gonna kill ya? Look, I know you're all about loyalty. Well, so am I. In fact many's the time..."
0,141,58,JAFFA,Silence!
0,141,58,O'NEILL,Teal'c!
0,141,59,TEAL'C,"Hear me, Jaffa. Your master is a false god and will surely be defeated. However, you still have a chance to be free."
0,141,59,JAFFA,"Your words mean nothing to me. I know who you are. The Shol'va, Teal'c and Bra'tac...O'Neill of the Tau'ri. Assassins who believe they could slay my Master."
0,141,60,O'NEILL,"Well, if we're assassins, who's that? Hmm?"
0,141,61,ROGELIO,"Dr. Jackson, Dr. Lee, can you hear me? Can you hear me?"
0,141,62,ROGELIO,"Are you okay? I thought you were dead for sure. What happened, Señor?"
0,141,62,JACKSON,We triggered some sort of trap.
0,141,62,LEE,I think I figured out why those passageways were so narrow. It's to prevent people from escaping alive.
0,141,62,JACKSON,You're good.
0,141,62,ROGELIO,"What have you found? Jackson and Lee, still trying to catch their breath, raise up their hands and slowly stand."
0,141,62,ROGELIO,"Oh, I'm not going to rob you, Señor."
0,141,63,ROGELIO,Hold still...madre de dios...
0,141,65,O'NEILL,Consider this...does it sound like it's going well?
0,141,65,TEAL'C,"Your master will be slain, as will you, if you do not free us."
0,141,65,JAFFA,You lie. My master is a god. He is invincible.
0,141,65,OTHER JAFFA,Orek kek! Ashah kree lok Jaffa!
0,141,66,O'NEILL,"You're next, you know?"
0,141,66,TEAL'C,Ramius will force you to die for him while he attempts to escape.
0,141,66,JAFFA,My god will fight for his people.
0,141,66,BRA'TAC,"You are wrong, my friend. Your god is somewhere cowering in fear like a child. I have seen it before. He will not hesitate to sacrifice all your lives to save his own."
0,141,67,O'NEILL,Hey! What about us?!
0,141,68,O'NEILL,Shouldn't it be getting easier to convince these guys?
0,141,68,CARTER,Sir...
0,141,69,O'NEILL,"Hang in there, Reynolds."
0,141,69,REYNOLDS,As long as it takes.
0,141,70,JAFFA,"Ramius has fallen. Go now, before it comes for you."
0,141,71,O'NEILL,"Go, go, go...Come on! Go on, let's go, let's go, let's go..."
0,141,72,O'NEILL,Come on...
0,141,74,JACKSON,"Listen, if this is some sort of turf thing we're not aware of, uh, we're sorry."
0,141,74,ROGELIO,"Oh, no Señor, por favor, please, don't speak."
0,141,74,JACKSON,"No, I'm just saying that-that whoever you guys think we are, we're not."
0,141,74,KIDNAPPER#1,Who do I think you are?
0,141,74,JACKSON,"I don't know. We're, uh, we're scientists, archaeologists as a matter of fact. I'm just saying that if, you know, this is a kidnapping, which I'm assuming it is, that you should know that we're not worth anything."
0,141,74,KIDNAPPER #1,"Trust me, Gringo, everyone's worth something to somebody."
0,141,74,LEE,"I tripped. I'm sorry. Gee, I can't see anything..."
0,141,75,KIDNAPPER #1,Chalo!
0,141,76,JACKSON,What just happened?
0,141,76,KIDNAPPER #1,"Your guide...he tried to run. What can you do? Maybe now we'll all stay on the path, eh muchachos? After you, Vámonos!"
0,141,77,O'NEILL,Ouch!
0,141,77,TEAL'C,It would appear Ramius was attempting to get to one of his ships.
0,141,77,CARTER,"Sir, I think we still have a chance to capture the warrior."
0,141,77,O'NEILL,How?
0,141,79,CARTER,Transport cycle complete.
0,141,79,O'NEILL,Carter? Did you get him?
0,141,80,CARTER,Got him.
0,141,80,O'NEILL,Good.
0,141,80,TEAL'C,Indeed.
0,141,81,KIDNAPPER #1,Chino! Jose! Several of those in the camp come to the newly arrived party.
0,141,81,KIDNAPPER #1,That far enough!
0,141,82,JACKSON,"Look I don't know what you expect, but no one's going to pay anything for us. We're not worth anything."
0,141,82,KIDNAPPER #1,"That is unfortunate for you, because if no one pays, you both die."
0,141,84,HAMMOND,It's still unconscious?
0,141,84,CARTER,"Not surprising, considering we voided the cargo bay of life support as soon as we got it on board the ship. It took 10 minutes for it to pass out."
0,141,84,HAMMOND,I'm surprised it's even still alive.
0,141,84,CARTER,"It put up a hell of a fight, sir."
0,141,85,HAMMOND,Hammond. Very well. Your prisoner is awake.
0,141,86,BRA'TAC,Who do you serve? Hmm? Speak!
0,141,86,SUPERSOLDIER,I serve Anubis.
0,141,87,TEAL'C,How were you created?
0,141,88,HAMMOND,I think it's safe to assume they're not going to get anything more out of him. Have you found anything else?
0,141,88,CARTER,"Our initial scans indicate below normal brainwave patterns emanating from both the symbiote and the host. Basically, he's got all the strength and healing powers of a normal Goa'uld, but none of the normal personality traits."
0,141,88,JACOB,The Goa'uld use sophisticated brainwashing techniques.
0,141,88,HAMMOND,"I'm open to suggestions. How can we find out what it knows, if anything?"
0,141,88,JACOB,There is one possibility. We may be able to use a memory recall device to access conscious images in its mind as it thinks them.
0,141,88,HAMMOND,Do it.
0,141,89,O'NEILL,Sir? Any word from Daniel?
0,141,89,HAMMOND,No. Dr. Jackson is now six hours overdue for his regular contact schedule.
0,141,89,O'NEILL,"That's late, even for Daniel."
0,141,89,HAMMOND,"The Honduran government has assured the State Department, they're looking into it. They've sent some people to their last reported location. So far, they've found nothing."
0,141,90,JACOB,"If his brainwaves are compatible with the device, we should be able to see whatever he is thinking holographically."
0,141,91,TEAL'C,What is your planet of origin?
0,141,92,JACOB,That's the sky above his planet.
0,141,92,CARTER,I don't recognize any of these star configurations. This could be anywhere.
0,141,92,JACOB,We have star mapping technology that should be able to pinpoint this location in the galaxy. He just gave us his home world.
0,141,93,KIDNAPPER #1,I know it's not much but...we do what we can.
0,141,94,KIDNAPPER #1,"So...here's my proposal for you. I will ask questions, you give me answers. I believe you, you get more water, food... maybe even a blanket at night, okay? Okay. Who do you work for?"
0,141,94,JACKSON,I told you we're archaeologists...
0,141,94,KIDNAPPER #1,"Maybe I was not so clear. If I don't believe you, things get worse for you...much worse."
0,141,94,JACKSON,You kill us you get nothing.
0,141,94,KIDNAPPER #1,"Maybe I kill one of you to get your government's attention. Who lives? Who dies? That's up to you, my friend."
0,141,94,JACKSON,"Okay, you, uh...you listen to me. What you're doing now is a big mistake. Some people...very powerful people are going to come for us and uh...well, let's just say by-by letting us go now, you're going to save yourself a lot of trouble."
0,141,94,KIDNAPPER #1,"Okay, we do it the hard way. Understand this, I will not hesitate to kill you both, make an example of you to your government so the next time they will take us seriously. You should know, many prisoner talk as you do, 'my friends will come and save me...' It gives them hope."
0,141,96,CARTER,The Tok'ra call it Tartarus. It's a seemingly unoccupied planet on the edge of Goa'uld controlled space.
0,141,96,JACOB,The Tok'ra are currently trying to get as close as they can to assess any defenses that might be there.
0,141,97,CARTER,Sir?
0,141,97,HAMMOND,"I'm afraid I have some bad news. I just received a communiqué from the State Department in Washington. It appears that Daniel Jackson and Dr. Lee have been kidnapped. Our best guess is they crossed the border into Nicaragua. However, as of this moment, we have no idea where they area."
