0,142,0,"""EVOLUTION II""",By Peter DeLuise
0,142,1,HAMMOND,"The CIA operative in Honduras, an Agent Burke believes he knows where Dr Jackson and Dr Lee were taken."
0,142,1,O'NEILL,Burke?
0,142,1,HAMMOND,You know him?
0,142,1,O'NEILL,"Yes, I do."
0,142,1,HAMMOND,"Anything I should know about, he's the only agent on this."
0,142,1,O'NEILL,"We're stuck with him regardless, right?"
0,142,1,HAMMOND,Right.
0,142,1,O'NEILL,Nothing you should know about.
0,142,1,HAMMOND,I see. He's requested that you participate in the extraction. The President has green lit the op. There's a C130 waiting for you at Peterson. It leaves for Honduras in 2 hours.
0,142,1,O'NEILL,Yes Sir.
0,142,2,CARTER,Sir?
0,142,2,O'NEILL,I'm going after Daniel.
0,142,2,CARTER,Good.
0,142,2,O'NEILL,This other mission.
0,142,2,CARTER,Shouldn't be a problem Sir. When do you leave?
0,142,2,O'NEILL,Now.
0,142,2,CARTER,Good luck.
0,142,2,O'NEILL,You too.
0,142,4,LEE,"I don't know anything, I don't know anything!"
0,142,4,REBELS,Apúrese
0,142,6,JACOB,We've confirmed that Anubis has a base on Tartarus. A powerful sensor array prevents anyone from approaching the planet unnoticed. The Stargate on Tartarus is inside the structure and has a powerful force field protecting it.
0,142,6,HAMMOND,"We need to know how Anubis created this new soldier, confirm what we believe his intentions are and if possible, stop him. Any ideas?"
0,142,6,CARTER,"Even if we could defeat the force field, we have to assume the Stargate would be heavily guarded."
0,142,6,TEAL'C,We must gain access to the planet by somehow temporarily shutting down the sensor array.
0,142,6,CARTER,I agree. The question is how?
0,142,6,SELMAK,I will walk through the Stargate.
0,142,6,HAMMOND,Selmak?
0,142,6,SELMAK,Yes.
0,142,6,HAMMOND,Come again?
0,142,6,SELMAK,"I will wear the armour of Anubis' assassin. According to your account on Ramius' planet, it passed through the force field trap."
0,142,6,BRA'TAC,But at what physical cost? We have no way of knowing.
0,142,6,CARTER,The force field around that Stargate has got to be more powerful than the one we used.
0,142,6,JACOB,I'm sorry kid; I'm with Selmak on this one. He'll keep me alive. Does anyone else have a better idea? Once I've deactivated the sensor array a scout ship can then approach the planet. Radioactive isotopes taken before hand will permit us to move around freely without being detected by internal sensors inside the base.
0,142,6,HAMMOND,What's your exit plan?
0,142,6,BRA'TAC,"The scout ship. During the mission, I will conceal it in one of the planet's many low lying chasms, powering down to further avoid detection."
0,142,6,HAMMOND,"Major, you have a go."
0,142,7,WAITER,"Estás bien? Jack: Sí, gracias."
0,142,7,BURKE,"You don't look very happy to see me. I would have given anything to see your face when you heard my name. Hey, it's okay man, it's okay."
0,142,7,O'NEILL,It's not okay. I've got 48 hours to find my friend before he's killed. Just tell me what you know.
0,142,7,BURKE,"Okay, all business, all the time. I can dig that station. This was the last place Daniel Jackson was seen before he hired a guide named Duran to take him into the jungle. And a short time after that he was snatched by anti-Honduran extremists."
0,142,7,O'NEILL,And you know this how?
0,142,7,BURKE,It's how this particular splinter group does business. Last year they kidnapped an important engineer working on the Cohune river dam. Big American contract. Insurance pays off and they finance their little war against the Government with the ransom.
0,142,7,O'NEILL,"This engineer, did he live?"
0,142,7,BURKE,"Yeah, he did. Sometimes they don't."
0,142,7,O'NEILL,What about weapons?
0,142,7,BURKE,"okay this is colourful. Honduras and Nicaragua are in the middle of a territorial dispute. I know what you're thinking, when are they not? So because of this, anyone in the I Hate Honduras fan club can seek shelter behind the Nicaraguan borders and buy guns. What kind of guns AK's, AK's for days. Nicaragua gets their stuff directly from Russia now but in the 80's they inherited all the old stuff from Cuba. How do you like that? They let us fight Cuba from their shores, we got our asses kicked and Cuba gives them the guns. You know we could get shot at by an AK 47 that was fired at the Bay of Pigs attack?"
0,142,7,O'NEILL,You been down here too long Burke.
0,142,7,BURKE,Hey you think so. You know why I got this crappy posting in this sinkhole.
0,142,7,O'NEILL,No. Here's comes the blame. Are you gonna try and blame me now?
0,142,7,BURKE,"Yeah, I do. You could have stood up for me. Hilary left me. What do you think happens in a friendly fire incident when one team member gets killed and the other doesn't vouch for him?"
0,142,7,O'NEILL,I didn't see what happened to Woods. I told them what I knew. I wasn't gonna lie. I told them what I knew.
0,142,7,BURKE,"I'm not talking about lying. I'm talking about my head, you, me, Woods, we were buddies man. You knew me."
0,142,7,O'NEILL,I told them what I knew.
0,142,7,BURKE,Well you didn't tell them enough. And now you're here stuck in my part of the world. You need me. And I'm calling it on this one.
0,142,7,O'NEILL,I don't think so.
0,142,7,BURKE,"I know how to get over the borders; I know where these rebels operate. Oh yeah, I'm in charge."
0,142,7,O'NEILL,No. You're just the guide.
0,142,7,BURKE,Just the guide. Is that what you think of me now?
0,142,7,O'NEILL,That's right. You're not so gone you don't understand the need for a clear chain of command are you?
0,142,7,BURKE,You want to know how gone I am?
0,142,8,WAITER,"quieres algo más señor Jack: si, necessito un guia."
0,142,8,WAITER,I am a guide. This? It's just my day job.
0,142,9,LEE,I never thought I would die like this.
0,142,9,DANIEL,"Ah, you're not dead yet."
0,142,9,LEE,I'm sorry Daniel. I couldn't take it. I told them.
0,142,9,DANIEL,What? What'd you tell them?
0,142,9,LEE,Everything.
0,142,11,SILER,How's that Sir?
0,142,11,JACOB,Pretty good. Reminds me of my old football days.
0,142,11,SILER,"They had helmets back in those days, Sir?"
0,142,11,JACOB,Funny.
0,142,11,HAMMOND,"Jacob, you okay in there?"
0,142,11,JACOB,It's surprisingly light. I guess it's time.
0,142,11,HAMMOND,Good luck.
0,142,11,JACOB,Thank you George.
0,142,13,THOTH,You. Come with me.
0,142,14,THOTH,Sit.
0,142,15,THOTH,You seem damaged.
0,142,16,CARTER,Come on Dad.
0,142,16,BRA'TAC,The array is yet to shut down. We are helpless to act. Even if we were to attempt secure communication.
0,142,16,CARTER,We would have to leave our position from the dark side of this moon making us visible to their sensors.
0,142,17,ANUBIS,Thoth.
0,142,17,THOTH,Lord Anubis. I was not expecting you.
0,142,17,ANUBIS,Tell me how this one has fared.
0,142,17,THOTH,This one has just returned my Lord. I need time to finish my preliminary analysis before I can make a proper report.
0,142,17,ANUBIS,It can wait. There is a remote probe malfunctioning. It requires your attention.
0,142,17,THOTH,yes my Lord.
0,142,18,CARTER,So many things could have gone wrong. He's so stubborn.
0,142,18,TEAL'C,Perhaps it is time to consider. Something beeps.
0,142,18,BRA'TAC,The sensor array is powered down. No doubt your father's stubbornness.
0,142,19,CARTER,Dad we're on the way.
0,142,19,JACOB,"Good. When you touch down, proceed to the exhaust port assemblage. I think I found a way to get you in."
0,142,19,CARTER,Copy.
0,142,20,O'NEILL,"All right, hold up. This is it."
0,142,20,GUIDE,"As I told you, there is nothing here."
0,142,20,BURKE,There is this well in the middle of nowhere. Standard US military boot tread all around. Make a wish.
0,142,21,BURKE,What took you so long? How hard could it be to track their GPS locators? I'm just kidding. I've only been here a couple of minutes myself.
0,142,21,O'NEILL,Change your mind?
0,142,21,BURKE,"In a manner of speaking. Vete, Regrésate a la cantina"
0,142,21,GUIDE,"4000, muchas gracias señor."
0,142,21,JACK,un momentito
0,142,21,BURKE,"This is the end of the road, man. I mean you didn't think these guys were gonna make it easy on you did you? I'll take you where you need to go."
0,142,21,O'NEILL,For old time's sake?
0,142,21,BURKE,"You know, I took an emotional inventory and I realised that I have some issues. Thought maybe we could put our petty differences aside on this one. You're gonna need me when this one goes down. Come on, give me a chance, I won't let you down."
0,142,21,BURKE,"Now we're talking sports fans. Okay my name is Burke and I'll be your guide, today we'll be looking at indigenous vegetation of Central America. Watch your step ladies, we're not in Minnesota."
0,142,21,O'NEILL,Easy.
0,142,22,RAPHAEL,If you value the life of your friend you will tell me what I want to know. Your friend told me this device may be the origin of the fountain of youth myth.
0,142,22,DANIEL,Maybe.
0,142,22,RAPHAEL,How does it work?
0,142,22,DANIEL,I don't know. Look you grabbed us 5 minutes after we found it.
0,142,22,RAPHAEL,Who is this Telchak?
0,142,22,DANIEL,"He's a mythological figure, a Mayan god that may or may not have lived here thousands of years ago."
0,142,22,RAPHAEL,So this device is many thousands of years old?
0,142,22,DANIEL,Possibly.
0,142,22,RAPHAEL,And this Mayan god brought this device to his temple for what purpose?
0,142,23,DANIEL,"To hide it, to use it, I don't know."
0,142,23,RAPHAEL,Use it. On whom?
0,142,23,DANIEL,People. Mayan people.
0,142,23,RAPHAEL,And what would it do to them?
0,142,23,DANIEL,"Look the research I used to find it just gave a cryptic warning that the device was dangerous, even harmful. That's all I know."
0,142,23,RAPHAEL,I do not think it is so harmful. I have never in my life felt as strong as I do right now.
0,142,23,DANIEL,You turned it on.
0,142,23,RAPHAEL,Yes.
0,142,23,DANIEL,"Turn it off; you don't know what you're dealing with. The effects of the device may be unstable. It's very dangerous. Look, it's beyond our comprehension, turn it off."
0,142,23,RAPHAEL,You're lying.
0,142,23,MAN,"What if he isn't? The device is cursed. Raphael, we should turn it off."
0,142,23,RAPHAEL,Turn it off? Do you not feel different as well?
0,142,23,MAN,"I do, and it scares me. Please, Raphael, if you will not turn it off, I will."
0,142,25,CARTER,What happened?
0,142,25,JACOB,I fooled the exhaust port into thinking it needed to purge the system.
0,142,25,CARTER,I mean with the sensor array.
0,142,25,JACOB,I got held up. Help me get this off.
0,142,25,BURKE,Rebels move around a lot. They're self taught bush fighters. see them tend to the farms right now. Those who don't are ex military. Most likely holding up about 20 clicks north west of Okata .
0,142,26,BURKE,"Well, this wasn't supposed to be on the tour. At least we know we're on the right track."
0,142,27,O'NEILL,Arrghhh!
0,142,27,GUIDE,I've been shot. Jack checks.
0,142,27,GUIDE,Arrh. No no no no no.
0,142,27,O'NEILL,You have been shot.
0,142,27,GUIDE,Si.
0,142,27,BURKE,A rescue should be here in about an hour.
0,142,27,GUIDE,I've been lying here for days. What's another hour?
0,142,27,O'NEILL,Who did this?
0,142,27,GUIDE,"malditos, malditos Que mueran del dolor del culo.(the translation must be: They die from pain in the ass"
0,142,27,O'NEILL,All right. We're looking for two scientists.
0,142,27,GUIDE,Dr Jackson? They have them. They went north. Across the border. Go.
0,142,27,BURKE,We're not just gonna leave you.
0,142,27,GUIDE,"Sure you can, Senor. Help will be here soon. Don't worry; this is not the first time I've been shot. Save your friends. Please. They owe me lots of money."
0,142,27,O'NEILL,Ah.
0,142,28,GUIDE,I love American gum. Good guys.
0,142,29,ANUBIS,Speak.
0,142,29,THOTH,Lord Anubis. One of the Cal warriors is missing.
0,142,29,ANUBIS,What is the reason for this behaviour?
0,142,29,THOTH,There was damage but I believe our method of governing the symbiote mind is still flawed
0,142,29,ANUBIS,Unacceptable. Determine the origin of the flaw and report back to me.
0,142,29,THOTH,Yes my Lord.
0,142,30,BURKE,"He moved, I killed him; it was as simple as that. Thought he was a hostile."
0,142,30,O'NEILL,It's all history Burke. Now's not really the time.
0,142,30,BURKE,I know we were out of position; I wanted to cut the angle down to cover you as you approached the objective. I guess Woods was doing the same.
0,142,30,O'NEILL,So you both took it upon yourselves to improvise at the same time.
0,142,30,BURKE,That's right.
0,142,31,JACOB,That's the third one I've seen.
0,142,31,CARTER,How many do you think Anubis has?
0,142,31,JACOB,There's no way of telling yet. I'm just guessing at least a handful; the lab I was in was made to service several.
0,142,32,JACOB,Symbiote holding tanks.
0,142,32,CARTER,All empty.
0,142,32,TEAL'C,This one is not.
0,142,34,LEE,Shouldn't we at least wait till night time?
0,142,34,DANIEL,I don't think we have that long.
0,142,34,LEE,We won't get a hundred yards before they kill us.
0,142,34,DANIEL,"Yeah, if we stay they'll definitely kill us. I saw the short term affects of that device. I know what a sarcophagus does to a person's sanity and this is far more powerful. I don't think we want to stick around to find out what long term exposure does."
0,142,36,CARTER,"Judging by the number of holding tanks in this room, Anubis must be planning to have the Queen spawn thousands of Goa'uld. But why. A symbiote is spawned with the genetic memory of the maternal bloodline. They're ego maniacal and power hungry. It's not exactly a good combination for a foot soldier."
0,142,36,JACOB,"That's right. But look at this. This Queen, whoever she is, must be in league with Anubis. She's preparing for a spawn cycle yet her brainwave pattern is minimal. She has no intention of passing on her genetic memory. The symbiotes will be blank slates."
0,142,36,TEAL'C,Much like Egeria on Pangar.
0,142,36,JACOB,"And Anubis will be free to imprint them however he see fit. No free will, they're drones. They make the perfect soldier. Deadly. Fearless. Unquestioning loyalty."
0,142,36,CARTER,But this is too similar to what happened on Pangar to be a coincidence. How did Anubis find out about Egeria?
0,142,36,TEAL'C,Jonas Quinn. Anubis must have acquired this information when he scanned Jonas Quinn's mind.
0,142,36,JACOB,If Anubis had any designs on creating a drone soldier that information would have been the final piece of the puzzle.
0,142,36,TEAL'C,This Queen must not be permitted to spawn again.
0,142,36,JACOB,Teal'c's right.
0,142,36,CARTER,Okay. We take what time we have remaining and try to find out what else Anubis is up to. Then we detonate the C4 and get out of here.
0,142,37,BURKE,Should be just a couple of clicks now. How can you trust me?
0,142,37,O'NEILL,I don't.
0,142,37,BURKE,Think I asked you to come down here so I could shoot you too?
0,142,37,O'NEILL,Why would I think that?
0,142,37,BURKE,Forget I said anything.
0,142,37,O'NEILL,You've had plenty of opportunity before now.
0,142,37,BURKE,What's worse is that you think I'm just incompetent.
0,142,37,O'NEILL,For crying out loud Burke.
0,142,37,BURKE,So you're perfectly willing to go into a hot situation with me watching your back?
0,142,37,O'NEILL,"I have no choice. And I was thinking of sending you in first, me watching your back."
0,142,37,BURKE,"You don't want to know the truth? I mean, come on, you really don't want to know? Man, it wasn't my fault. I mean I didn't choose, I just reacted. It stinks, the whole damn thing stinks. You want to know what really happened, fine. I'll tell you. Woods was ghosting us, he sold out, he was no good. He was sending out a rogue transmission, he was giving our position away. Woods realised that I was on to him and turned his weapon on me. And I just, I just reacted."
0,142,37,O'NEILL,Why didn't you come forward with this?
0,142,37,BURKE,"Come on man, you remember how close we were. The wives and the beers and the barbeques. I couldn't do that to Cindy. It comes out Woods was a traitor; she doesn't see a penny of that pension, a month away from his retirement. Woods wasn't gonna retire; he was setting himself up as a mercenary for that warlord. He made his choice, he`s gone and that's all that matters"
0,142,39,DANIEL,That's not good.
0,142,39,RAPHAEL,Disparen
0,142,40,RAPHAEL,No! No! you've let them escape. Vamos a matarlos
0,142,42,CARTER,There must be a console that will let us access a log of recent activity. Even if it doesn't contain Anubis' long range plans we might be able to gather intel on the movement of his fleet.
0,142,42,JACOB,"Nothing but labs, corridors and storage in this direction. I think Anubis' quarters are this way."
0,142,43,DANIEL,"Bill, you gotta keep moving."
0,142,45,DANIEL,Stay down.
0,142,49,ANUBIS,You are all my children. Cal warriors. You are the instruments of my conquest.
0,142,49,WARRIORS,Hail Anubis! Hail Anubis! Hail Anubis!
0,142,50,RAPHAEL,I'm going to skin you alive.
0,142,51,O'NEILL,How many more are there? Daniel?
0,142,51,DANIEL,That's it. You got them all. What are you doing here?
0,142,51,CARTER,There must be thousands of them.
0,142,52,THOTH,Fools!
0,142,53,C4.,
0,142,53,CARTER,"Bra'tac, we need that ride now."
0,142,53,BRA'TAC,I will be there momentarily.
0,142,55,O'NEILL,You be able to walk on this?
0,142,55,DANIEL,Yeah.
0,142,56,DANIEL,Telchak's device re animates the dead just as..
0,142,56,O'NEILL,Yeah whatever.
0,142,57,BURKE,"Hey, get down."
0,142,58,BURKE,What's with the guy from evil dead?
0,142,58,O'NEILL,um.
0,142,58,BURKE,Classified?
0,142,58,O'NEILL,Yeah.
0,142,58,BURKE,You guys are into some crazy crap man.
0,142,59,JACOB,What was that?
0,142,59,CARTER,Can't be good. Just punch it.
0,142,60,BRA'TAC,Someone has opened the rear engine access hatch.
0,142,60,CARTER,We're mid flight.
0,142,61,BRA'TAC,Teal'c. Are you hurt?
0,142,61,TEAL'C,Indeed.
0,142,61,BRA'TAC,Where?
0,142,61,TEAL'C,My pride. An old man did what I could not.
0,142,61,JACOB,"Sam? Sam? No, don't move, just lie still. What hurts?"
0,142,61,CARTER,Everything.
0,142,61,JACOB,That's a good sign.
0,142,61,BURKE,"Perimeters clear. Just heard from air rescue, they got the guide."
0,142,61,DANIEL,
0,142,61,BURKE,"Yeah, he's gonna be okay, they'll be here soon."
0,142,61,O'NEILL,hey. Nice back up.
0,142,61,BURKE,"Buddy, any time anywhere."
0,142,61,O'NEILL,"You know, I think I should recommend that you be posted to a nicer place."
0,142,61,BURKE,"A temperate zone, not too hot, not too cold. Fine looking women that put out like broken candy machines."
0,142,61,O'NEILL,Whatever. I'll see what I can do.
0,142,61,BURKE,"Thanks buddy. Is that, that thing that made that guy do that thing?"
0,142,61,DANIEL,"Yeah, it's okay, it's off now."
0,142,61,O'NEILL,"Good, that's good."
0,142,61,LEE,"Yeah, at least we think it's off. It's not glowing any more so."
0,142,61,DANIEL,Glowing thing really gives it away so if it's not glowing any more it shouldn't be on any more.
0,142,61,LEE,Do you want to hold it?
0,142,61,DANIEL,Nope.
0,142,62,BURKE,It's crazy.
0,142,63,O'NEILL,So. Miss me?
0,142,63,CARTER,Of course Sir.
0,142,63,O'NEILL,Well it couldn't have been that bad. You're all still alive.
0,142,63,TEAL'C,As are you and Daniel Jackson.
0,142,63,CARTER,Daniel?
0,142,63,DANIEL,I'm fine. We got the device from Telchak.
0,142,63,JACOB,Good. Hopefully we can engineer a weapon from it.
0,142,63,BRA'TAC,You must. Or we will be left helpless to combat these new warriors.
0,142,63,CARTER,We have some bad news Sir. Anubis has an entire army of these super soldiers. There are thousands of them. The best we were able to do was delay his ability to manufacture more.
0,142,63,HAMMOND,We'll debrief fully in one hour. Welcome home.
0,142,64,O'NEILL,Hey. So nice command.
0,142,64,CARTER,"We did manage to make it out alive, Sir."
0,142,64,O'NEILL,There's that. Lunch?
