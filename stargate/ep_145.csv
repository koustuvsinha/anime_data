0,145,2,DANIEL,"Amulet is likely from the 12th dynastic period, inland markings suggest the royal house of Amu'net. Possibly a gift from the King and immediate family to commemorate a birth or coming of age or.."
0,145,2,SARAH,"It's for luck. Royal goldsmiths made them for the King in the hopes that the floodwaters would rise again in the Nile, granting them a bountiful crop."
0,145,2,DANIEL,Good guess.
0,145,2,SARAH,Doctor Jordan sent me a picture a few weeks ago; I suppose I had a bit of a head start.
0,145,3,SARAH,"Oh', I'm Sarah Gardner."
0,145,5,PETE,Is this seat taken?
0,145,5,SAM,"Well no, but there's plenty of other empty.."
0,145,6,SAM,Tables..
0,145,6,PETE,"Yeah, but none of them has beautiful, single women sitting at them."
0,145,6,SAM,"Well thank you, but how do you know I'm single?"
0,145,6,PETE,There's no ring no your finger.
0,145,6,SAM,I could have a boyfriend.
0,145,6,PETE,You're having coffee by yourself at 7:30 in the morning.
0,145,6,SAM,You're very observant.
0,145,6,PETE,I'm a cop.
0,145,6,SAM,"Well then, I feel compelled to warn you, most of the guys I have dated recently, have died."
0,145,6,PETE,As in..
0,145,6,SAM,Dead.
0,145,6,PETE,How?
0,145,6,SAM,Various circumstances.
0,145,6,PETE,I'll risk it.
0,145,7,PETE,How about dinner tonight? My motel room.
0,145,7,SAM,Your motel room?
0,145,7,PETE,"Yeah, I'm in town from Denver on a case. I'll order room service, open a box of wine.."
0,145,7,SAM,A box.
0,145,7,PETE,Something with a duck on the front.
0,145,8,SAM,Stop it Pete.
0,145,8,PETE,What are you talking about? I'm on a roll here. I haven't even shown you my badge yet.
0,145,8,SAM,And I gotta' go.
0,145,8,PETE,"Come on Sam, call in sick. Spend the day with me; we'll go to the zoo."
0,145,8,SAM,There's no zoo in Colorado Springs.
0,145,8,PETE,Bowling. There must be a bowling alley around here somewhere.
0,145,8,SAM,I have to work.
0,145,8,PETE,Can't the world wait one more day for more deep space telemetry?
0,145,8,SAM,Have you seen how much deep space there is out there?
0,145,9,SAM,I'll see you tonight.
0,145,10,SAM,It jams the frequency the Goa'uld use for communication and the remote control devices like the ring transporters. Right now we're working on making it portable enough to..
0,145,11,SAM,At least pretend that it's interesting.
0,145,11,DANIEL,"No, it was very interesting. Please, go on."
0,145,11,SAM,Are you tired?
0,145,11,DANIEL,Ya' think? I had the weirdest dream last night.
0,145,11,SAM,About what?
0,145,11,DANIEL,"Uh' you know, working back in Chicago with Sarah. Before the Stargate program."
0,145,11,SAM,How is that weird?
0,145,11,DANIEL,"Things were all mixed up, my hair was different.. you know."
0,145,11,SAM,"Well, no offence Daniel but it's not like you don't have some issues to work out."
0,145,11,DANIEL,Oh' yeah.
0,145,11,SAM,Maybe you should talk to someone.
0,145,12,SAM,Colonel.
0,145,12,JACK,Carter.
0,145,13,DANIEL,Coffee.
0,145,13,SAM,Talk to you later okay?
0,145,14,JACK,Humming?
0,145,14,SAM,I am?
0,145,14,JACK,You are.
0,145,14,SAM,Sorry.
0,145,14,JACK,What's his name?
0,145,14,SAM,No one.
0,145,14,JACK,Humming.
0,145,14,SAM,Pete.
0,145,14,JACK,Pete?
0,145,14,SAM,"Pete Shannahan, he's a cop."
0,145,14,JACK,Speeding again are we?
0,145,14,SAM,"He's from Denver, he's a friend of my brothers."
0,145,14,JACK,Set-up.
0,145,14,SAM,"Pathetic, I know."
0,145,14,JACK,"No, it's great."
0,145,14,SAM,Really?
0,145,14,JACK,Isn't it?
0,145,14,SAM,Well it's not serious or anything.
0,145,14,JACK,And yet it is humworthy.
0,145,14,SAM,But Sir..
0,145,14,JACK,But Carter it's none of my.. business. I'm just happy that you're happy about something else then.. quarks.
0,145,15,JACK,Not bad with quarks huh?
0,145,15,SAM,Excellent.
0,145,15,JACK,A bit uncomfortable isn't it?
0,145,15,SAM,"Yeah, a bit."
0,145,16,JACK,Good luck.
0,145,16,SAM,Thank you Sir.
0,145,19,SARAH,Good morning.
0,145,19,DANIEL,"Oh'.. hello. I'm sorry, I didn't hear you come in. I mean um'.. how are you?"
0,145,19,SARAH,Fine.
0,145,19,DANIEL,"Yeah, you settling in?"
0,145,19,SARAH,"Well except for want of a decent cup of tea, I'm in heaven."
0,145,19,DANIEL,Good. It's good to hear.
0,145,19,SARAH,"You know, I must have read everything you've ever published."
0,145,19,DANIEL,Everything?
0,145,19,SARAH,Yes.
0,145,19,DANIEL,What a waste of time.
0,145,19,SARAH,"Please, your theories on the Hikish ruling dynasty are truly groundbreaking, if a little audacious. It was quite inspiring. In fact I referenced them in my doctoral thesis at Cambridge."
0,145,19,DANIEL,You must have failed.
0,145,19,SARAH,I just hope that I can live up to such talented company.
0,145,19,DANIEL,Well if you're here then you have.. you are..
0,145,19,SARAH,"Stop, the flattery is overwhelming."
0,145,20,SARAH,I should let you continue.
0,145,20,DANIEL,"Yeah, I am gonna' continue.. you know I this good place for coffee. No, I'm sure they serve tea."
0,145,20,SARAH,"I'd like that, Doctor Jackson."
0,145,20,DANIEL,Daniel.
0,145,20,SARAH,Daniel. You know I can't tell you how much I have looked forward to being here with you. Being able to pick your brain.
0,145,22,SAM,That was great.
0,145,22,PETE,"Yeah, it was okay. I mean the company was fine."
0,145,22,SAM,"Oh' come on, how can you not like 'Singing In The Rain?'"
0,145,22,PETE,I guess I've always been more of a Fred Astair fan.
0,145,22,SAM,It's a classic.
0,145,22,PETE,"Woah, woah there lady. I believe the term classic is reserved for the likes of The French Connection, Dirty Harry, Serpico."
0,145,22,SAM,Cop movies.
0,145,22,PETE,What's your point?
0,145,22,SAM,This was romantic.
0,145,22,PETE,Watching a man dance around in the rain with an umbrella?
0,145,22,SAM,Just because there were no guns or car chases.
0,145,22,PETE,Or nudity.
0,145,22,SAM,"Yeah, well your chances of that are slim to none now."
0,145,22,PETE,Have I ever told you what a good dancer I am?
0,145,23,PETE,You know my case down here wraps up tomorrow.
0,145,23,SAM,Does that mean you're heading back to Denver?
0,145,23,PETE,Actually I called my Captain and said I don't care if crime is running rampant up there.. I met this woman. This amazing person.. and we've got this thing going on.
0,145,23,SAM,And what did he say?
0,145,23,PETE,Get your ass back here or you're fired.
0,145,23,SAM,Too bad.
0,145,23,PETE,I'm lying. I told him I'm taking two weeks vacation. Truth is.. Colorado Springs is very.. underrated.
0,145,24,SAM,Pete..
0,145,24,PETE,And it was going so well.
0,145,24,SAM,It is.
0,145,24,PETE,But..?
0,145,24,SAM,It's getting late.
0,145,24,PETE,It's seven o'clock.
0,145,24,SAM,I have to get up really early.
0,145,24,PETE,To go to work?
0,145,24,SAM,Right..
0,145,24,PETE,"Which involves long arduous hours of you looking into a telescope. Sam, have I mentioned I'm a cop? I interrogate people for a living."
0,145,24,SAM,Are you saying you don't believe me?
0,145,24,PETE,Is this all going too fast for you? Because I can back off........ Give you 5 or 10 minutes.
0,145,25,PETE,I'll call you.
0,145,25,SAM,Right..
0,145,25,PETE,Have I left yet..?
0,145,26,PETE,It came from my legs.
0,145,29,DANIEL,Thank you.
0,145,30,SARAH,"A little human contact first, if you please."
0,145,31,SARAH,Was that so hard?
0,145,31,DANIEL,I'll live.
0,145,31,SARAH,You've been here all night haven't you?
0,145,31,DANIEL,"What, is it morning already?"
0,145,31,SARAH,I've got something for you.
0,145,32,DANIEL,How'd you get that?
0,145,32,SARAH,It was found during an expedition in the Rocko last month. An associate of mine sent it to me for analysis. No one's quite sure what to make of it. I took the liberty of running a carbon dating. It's over ten thousand years old.
0,145,32,DANIEL,That's impossible.
0,145,32,SARAH,"The lack of writing, and the pyramids themselves, the inconclusive findings on several of the artifacts found at the Henderson dig.."
0,145,32,DANIEL,Are you saying that this proves once and for all that there existed a language on Earth that pre-dates all hieroglyphics?
0,145,32,SARAH,I thought you might enjoy the challenge.
0,145,33,SARAH,Daniel..?
0,145,33,DANIEL,I recognize this.
0,145,33,SARAH,How could you?
0,145,33,DANIEL,"Well believe it or not, I believe Latin is a derivative; we can use it as a reference point."
0,145,33,SARAH,"Daniel, how could you possibly know that?"
0,145,33,DANIEL,I don't know.. I just do.
0,145,34,DANIEL,This makes no sense.
0,145,34,SAM,Maybe you should eat something.
0,145,34,DANIEL,"Did I mention that in the dream, the table was written in Ancient, and that I could read ancient?"
0,145,34,SAM,Well's that's not so odd considering you can do that when you're awake.
0,145,34,TEAL'C,Perhaps you are attempting to reveal something to yourself.
0,145,34,DANIEL,Like..
0,145,34,SAM,Like something from when you were ascended.
0,145,34,TEAL'C,Like you prior vision of Bray'tac and Ry'ak in danger.
0,145,34,SAM,The tablet sounds a lot like the one you found when you were on Abydos.
0,145,34,TEAL'C,It could lead to the lost city of the ancients.
0,145,34,DANIEL,You think that somehow I know the location of The Lost City and I don't remember?
0,145,34,TEAL'C,"If you have the dream again, perhaps you should translate the tablet."
0,145,37,SARAH,I thought you might need a break.
0,145,37,DANIEL,"Wow, this is really nice. I don't really deserve you.. do I."
0,145,37,SARAH,No.. hungry?
0,145,37,DANIEL,Actually I can't remember the last time I ate.
0,145,37,SARAH,How's it going?
0,145,37,DANIEL,"I'm so close, I think I found a basic structure to the whole thing."
0,145,37,SARAH,Really?
0,145,37,DANIEL,"Yeah, it's about guidance. At first I thought that was script for some sense of spiritual guidance but I was wrong about that. Here."
0,145,38,DANIEL,"Look, something about a starting point, a place of origin. Steps of a great journey leading to.."
0,145,38,SARAH,What? Leading to what?
0,145,38,DANIEL,"A city. A place of great power. It's a map, telling us how to find a city where an ancient race of humans once lived."
0,145,41,DANIEL,"See I know what the tablet is supposed to say, I just can't seem to finish translating it."
0,145,41,TEAL'C,"Perhaps the location of The Lost City was not the answer in your mind that you were searching for after all. Since I now require sleep, I have developed an interest in the concept of dreams. There is much research to study on the matter."
0,145,41,DANIEL,"Okay Sigmund, what are my dreams about?"
0,145,41,TEAL'C,"Since your friend Sarah was taken as a host by Osiris, you have been unable to save her. Perhaps that is the focus of your sub-conscious desires."
0,145,41,DANIEL,You think something I knew while I was ascended could help?
0,145,41,TEAL'C,Most often dreams are the minds way of dealing with desires that cannot be fulfilled.
0,145,41,DANIEL,So basically I'm never going to get another good nights sleep ever again.
0,145,41,TEAL'C,"With all of your past experiences Daniel Jackson, I do not know how you have slept well before now."
0,145,41,DANIEL,"Thank you Teal'c, this session has been disturbing on many levels."
0,145,43,SAM,Up enough?
0,145,43,DANIEL,
0,145,43,SAM,I'll take that as a yes.
0,145,44,SAM,Are those for me?
0,145,44,PETE,"Uh'.. yeah. It's the other eleven, the one I left before makes a dozen."
0,145,44,SAM,"I get it. They're beautiful, thank you."
0,145,45,SAM,Now?
0,145,45,PETE,No.
0,145,45,SAM,Now?
0,145,45,PETE,No.
0,145,45,SAM,Now?
0,145,45,PETE,"No, will you stop?"
0,145,45,SAM,How about now?
0,145,45,PETE,No.. okay now.
0,145,46,PETE,Whadda' ya' think?
0,145,46,SAM,I think we're gonna' get noticed.
0,145,47,SAM,This is great.
0,145,47,PETE,"It's nice to know that people still stay together no matter what, isn't it?"
0,145,48,DANIEL,I can't do this.
0,145,48,SARAH,And what's the matter?
0,145,48,DANIEL,I'm just going in circles. I can't find any references that relate to this passage.
0,145,48,SARAH,Doorway?
0,145,48,DANIEL,What?
0,145,48,SARAH,The origin of doorways.
0,145,48,DANIEL,How do you know that?
0,145,48,SARAH,It makes sense doesn't it?
0,145,48,DANIEL,"Yeah, but, how do you know that?"
0,145,48,SARAH,"Daniel, it's all there. You just need to relax."
0,145,49,DANIEL,Oh no.
0,145,49,SARAH,What?
0,145,49,DANIEL,We're supposed to have dinner tonight.
0,145,49,DANIEL,"Two months right? I'm so sorry, I totally forgot. Why didn't you remind me?"
0,145,49,SARAH,It's all right.
0,145,49,DANIEL,It's too late now.
0,145,49,SARAH,"I understand. If it was that important to me, I would have said something."
0,145,49,DANIEL,You don't mind.
0,145,49,SARAH,Of course not.
0,145,49,DANIEL,You're supposed to leave.
0,145,49,SARAH,"What are you talking about; I'm not going anywhere. Daniel your research is gonna change the world. You're a brilliant mind; I don't want to stand in the way of that. I want to be part of it. I am however, going to order us pizza"
0,145,50,SARAH,Get back to work.
0,145,51,SAM,"So, you wanna come in?"
0,145,51,PETE,"I don't know. The inside of your house, that's a pretty big step."
0,145,51,SAM,Suit yourself.
0,145,52,PETE,"I'm just saying that right now, you're pretty much perfect. What if it turns out you're really messy or worse. You're a neat freak weirdo, with labeled drawers and an alphabetized bookshelf."
0,145,53,PETE,"Ok, I'm coming."
0,145,54,PETE,Wow!
0,145,54,SAM,Just don't look at the bookshelves.
0,145,55,SAM,So why did you become a cop?
0,145,55,PETE,"I watched too much TV as a kid. Starsky and Hutch, Barney Miller."
0,145,55,SAM,Barney Miller?
0,145,55,PETE,"It's my favorite show. Those guys never shot anybody, never beat anybody up."
0,145,55,SAM,That's it?
0,145,55,PETE,What did you think? Every cop out there has an inspirational story? It's just a job Sam.
0,145,55,SAM,I don't think so. Not for you. Anyway Mark told me you have a story.
0,145,55,PETE,Bastard. Never date your buddys sister.
0,145,55,SAM,He never told me what it was.
0,145,55,PETE,"It's no big deal. I had a bit of a rough time when I was growing up. Truth is, I probably would have ended up in jail if it werent for this one particular cop who took an interest. He really made a difference in my life and I admired that."
0,145,55,SAM,Its an honorable job.
0,145,55,PETE,Well my ex wife didn't think so. Did you ever see the episode where Barney comes home and all his stuff is on the front lawn with the divorce papers stapled on top?
0,145,55,SAM,No.
0,145,55,PETE,"I didn't blame her. I mean the hours suck and you never know if....I didn't have a choice, it's who I am."
0,145,55,SAM,I can understand that.
0,145,55,PETE,Really. Deep Space Telemetry is who you are.
0,145,55,SAM,I wish I could tell you more.
0,145,55,PETE,You don't trust me?
0,145,55,SAM,Im not allowed.
0,145,56,SAM,Where you going?
0,145,56,PETE,I'm gonna drive back to Denver today and file my report.
0,145,56,SAM,"Pete, aside from getting in huge trouble myself. I could be putting you in danger."
0,145,56,PETE,Oh now you're trying to tell me that joke about your boyfriends all ending up dead is true?
0,145,56,SAM,Pete.....Please.
0,145,56,PETE,"The problem is, I feel like I've just scratched the surface with you Sam. How can we have a future if you won't share your life with me?"
0,145,57,FBI,Federal Bureau of Investigation. How may I transfer your call?
0,145,57,PETE,Special Agent Ferretty please.
0,145,57,FBI,I'll transfer you now. Please hold.
0,145,57,FERRETTY,Ferretty.
0,145,57,PETE,Hey Dan its Pete.
0,145,57,FERRETTY,Hey Shandy what's up buddy.
0,145,57,PETE,"I'm in Colorado Springs on a case right now and I need a favor man. Can you do a background check on someone for me? Top down, global agency search, the works?"
0,145,57,FERRETTY,"Sure thing, who is it?"
0,145,57,PETE,An Air Force Major. Samantha Carter.
0,145,58,DANIEL,The only thing I don't have is a gate address. There are still a few passages I haven't been able to translate.
0,145,58,SAM,Do you think you can?
0,145,58,DANIEL,"I don't know. It's like I'm not in control. Like I'm just along for the ride, watching the whole thing unfold. The strange thing is, none of it's right."
0,145,58,TEAL'C,Please elaborate Daniel Jackson.
0,145,58,DANIEL,"I was an idiot. Sarah was in love with me and I guess I had feelings for her too, but my obsession with my research destroyed our relationship. She finally broke it off with me when I worked through our anniversary. The Sarah I'm dreaming about now is like, totally different. Its like she cares about my work as much as I do. Like she wants me to find the Lost City as much as I do."
0,145,58,SAM,Sounds like a normal male fantasy to me.
0,145,58,TEAL'C,Did you not say that Sarah introduced the tablet to you during one of the dreams?
0,145,58,TEAL'C,Yeah.
0,145,58,TEAL'C,And that you feel that you have no control of the dreams.
0,145,58,DANIEL,Yeah.
0,145,58,SAM,Teal'c?
0,145,58,TEAL'C,The Goa'uld possess technology to explore one's memory.
0,145,59,HAMMOND,Your suggesting that Osiris is here on Earth manipulating Doctor Jacksons dreams?
0,145,59,SAM,We think it's possible sir.
0,145,59,JACK,Kinky!
0,145,59,DANIEL,She's looking for the location of the Lost City in my subconscious. Im sure of it now. She's using the implanted image of an ancient tablet to help me figure it out.
0,145,59,TEAL'C,Osiris can access Sarah's memories and use them to gain Daniel Jackson's trust.
0,145,59,HAMMOND,Well how's she doing it?
0,145,59,SAM,We're speculating that she's sneaking into Daniel's house at night and using some sort of modified memory device.
0,145,59,TEAL'C,Anubis once probed Thor's mind and in doing so they would have gained access to certain Asgard technology.
0,145,59,DANIEL,That would certainly allow her to come and go undetected.
0,145,59,HAMMOND,"Why go to all that trouble? Why not just snatch up Doctor Jackson and use a mind probe on him, the way they did with Thor?"
0,145,59,SAM,It's possible Anubis' mind probe won't work on the subconscious.
0,145,59,DANIEL,It might have something to do with how Oma erased my memories when I was ascended.
0,145,59,TEAL'C,This may be the best way to get Daniel Jackson to unknowingly help them learn what they wish to know.
0,145,59,JACK,"So, what do we do?"
0,145,59,TEAL'C,The Goa'uld are scavengers of alien technology. They would most likely interface any Asgard system with their own command device.
0,145,59,SAM,"We're hoping the jamming device we've been working on, could prevent Osiris from using the beam technology to escape Daniel's room."
0,145,59,HAMMOND,You want to set up a trap.
0,145,59,DANIEL,"Yes, but we don't want to spring it until after she's helped me remember the location of the Lost City."
0,145,59,JACK,What?
0,145,59,DANIEL,"Look, no one wants to save Sarah more than I do, but I could know. I mean, it could be there, somewhere in my subconscious. We have to let her think that she's still operating without our knowledge. At least until I have the chance to try to finish this."
0,145,59,JACK,"And how are we supposed to know, when you know, if it's all happening in your head while your sleeping?"
0,145,59,DANIEL,I don't know?
0,145,59,HAMMOND,"Well, you'd better figure it out. We can't risk letting Osiris escape with that kind of information."
0,145,60,PETE,Shanahan.
0,145,60,FERRETTY,Hey buddy. Its me. I got what you wanted.
0,145,60,PETE,Just give me the highlights.
0,145,60,FERRETTY,Well there's a lot of backstop ID.
0,145,60,PETE,"Works for the Air Force. Does deep space telemetry for Norad, I know. Is that all you found?"
0,145,60,FERRETTY,Actually it's what didn't turn up that say's the most. The backstop dead ends.
0,145,60,PETE,She's been scrubbed.
0,145,60,FERRETTY,Yep. Someone went in the system and wiped out every possible of her and left only what they want others to see. Shes probably connected with some top-level stuff.
0,145,60,PETE,Like?
0,145,60,FERRETTY,"Black ops, covert units. Things the government denies all knowledge of, you know what I'm saying? Look Pete, if you ask me, this Major Carter's connected. You might wanna back off from this one ok buddy? It's way out of your league."
0,145,60,PETE,Hey! It's not like I'm dating her or anything.
0,145,60,FERRETTY,Right.
0,145,62,ANSWERPHONE,"Hello, this is Pete...."
0,145,62,SAM,"Hi, it's me."
0,145,62,ANSWERPHONE,I'm probably chasing a bad guy. Leave a message.
0,145,64,JACK,So what do we got?
0,145,64,SAM,"Daniel's at his house with a team, setting up video surveillance."
0,145,64,JACK,Teal'cs picking out his doughnuts. He loves a good stakeout.
0,145,65,SAM,The jamming device has been installed in the surveillance van. It should prevent Osiris from beaming herself out.
0,145,65,JACK,Were taking her down with these?
0,145,66,SAM,"She likely has a personal shield, but we know that a tranquillizer dart will get through. At that point we hope that the Tok'ra can safely remove the symbiote and save Sarah."
0,145,66,JACK,What about this whole Lost City deal?
0,145,66,SAM,"We watch and see. Once in his room, Osiris won't be able to leave. Its just a question of us getting to her before she realizes that she's been made."
0,145,66,JACK,Back up?
0,145,66,SAM,"Local authorities have been notified, but we don't wanna do anything to alert Osiris."
0,145,66,JACK,How's Pete?
0,145,66,SAM,You know how it is. Usually you don't let it bother you because you know that they couldn't cope with the truth anyway.
0,145,66,JACK,Usually.
0,145,66,SAM,I think he could have.
0,145,67,JACK,Hey Daniel. Daniel! You sleeping yet?
0,145,67,DANIEL,"Yes Jack, I'm fast asleep."
0,145,68,JACK,"What have you got there?.......No, I'll pass."
0,145,69,JACK,Here we go.
0,145,69,SAM,Activating frequency jamming.
0,145,69,JACK,Let's do it.
0,145,70,JACK,Carter.
0,145,70,SAM,She's still there sir.
0,145,70,JACK,How long do we wait?
0,145,70,SAM,I don't know. Daniel must be getting close.
0,145,72,SARAH,Progress?
0,145,72,DANIEL,Not really. I'm still convinced these symbols represent the location of the Lost City.
0,145,72,SARAH,Like an address?
0,145,72,DANIEL,Yeah. There's seven of them. They don't translate into anything specific.
0,145,72,SARAH,You're so close.
0,145,72,DANIEL,No I am not!
0,145,72,SARAH,Don't say that Daniel.
0,145,72,DANIEL,They mean nothing to me.
0,145,72,SARAH,You've worked too hard to give up now.
0,145,72,DANIEL,I don't know. I never knew.
0,145,73,OSIRIS,How unfortunate for you.
0,145,74,SAM,"Move in, move in."
0,145,75,PETE,Sam.
0,145,75,SAM,Pete I....
0,145,76,SAM,Get down!
0,145,77,TEAL'C,Will you be all right?
0,145,77,DANIEL,"Yeah, go, go, go go."
0,145,78,SAM,It's no use Pete!
0,145,78,PETE,"Yeah, why is that?"
0,145,79,PETE,Now that is not normal.
0,145,80,SAM,Go!
0,145,81,JACK,Clear!
0,145,82,SAM,Are you ok?
0,145,82,PETE,I'm ok. Are you ok?
0,145,82,SAM,Yeah.
0,145,82,PETE,Well that's good.
0,145,83,SAM,"Oh god, Pete, you've been hit."
0,145,83,JACK,Carter!
0,145,83,SAM,It's Pete. He needs an ambulance! Just hang in there ok?
0,145,83,PETE,Sam? What just happened?
0,145,83,SAM,"I promise if you make it through this, I will explain everything."
0,145,83,PETE,Yeah.
0,145,84,DANIEL,"It's all right, you're safe."
0,145,84,SARAH,Daniel?
0,145,84,DANIEL,It's all right. I'm here. It's all over. Youre free.
0,145,85,SARAH,I'm so sorry.
0,145,85,DANIEL,It's not your fault.
0,145,85,SARAH,I couldn't stop it.
0,145,85,DANIEL,I'll get you through this.
0,145,86,SAM,"Hey, they treating you ok?"
0,145,86,PETE,Yeah. Who would have thought there's a hospital under Cheyenne Mountain.
0,145,86,SAM,One of the best anywhere.
0,145,86,PETE,This place is unbelievable.
0,145,86,SAM,You've no idea.
0,145,87,PETE,Thanks.
0,145,88,PETE,I believe I lived up to my end of the bargain.
0,145,88,SAM,What I'm about to tell you is classified under section 11C9 of the National Security Act.
0,145,88,PETE,Chicks with laser beam rings and glowing eyes are classified under 11C9.
0,145,88,SAM,Just let me talk will ya?
0,145,88,PETE,Ok.
0,145,88,SAM,"You're currently in a top secret military facility known as Stargate Command. In 1928 in Giza, Egypt, Archaeologists uncovered an ancient device, capable of instantaneous transportation to other planets by means of a subspace wormhole."
0,145,88,PETE,I knew it. This is way better than a box of wine with a duck on the front.
0,145,88,SAM,I'm not kidding.
0,145,88,PETE,"It's all right. Other planets, wormholes. Continue."
