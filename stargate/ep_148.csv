0,148,0,"""HEROES II""",By Robert C. Cooper
0,148,4,SAM,Ye there are days when you feel the pressure.I'm trained to handle it.
0,148,4,EMMETT,With all due respect Major *we see Emmett in a suit* How could anyone be trained to handle an alien encounter when the stakes are.what I'm told is correct.the stakes could be the survival of the planet.
0,148,4,SAM,"I think it's important to remember that, It's not just about this planet.countless humans through out the galaxy people who originated right"
0,148,5,EMMETT,"So how do you think the American people are going to react.the world is going to react when they discover that a war, an alien war, has been waged without their knowledge."
0,148,5,SAM,I don't think that that's.that's for me to.erm.are you suggesting that we shouldn't be doing this?
0,148,5,EMMETT,"No I'm not saying we shouldn't defend ourselves, I'm simply asking your opinion Major."
0,148,5,SAM,
0,148,6,EMMETT,No stop it right there.
0,148,6,SAM,"I don't know.*stopped* EMMETT: This is.erm.not her fault, see I backed her into a corner.and I do not want this to look antagonistic so."
0,148,6,DALE,So lose this.
0,148,6,EMMETT,Well.I don't know.Just skip ahead to err.after the apology.*keyboard tapping*.There. That's it.
0,148,6,EMMETT,*On screen* Major.one day the secret will all come out how do you think the people of the world are going to react?
0,148,6,EMMETT,Much better way of asking the question.
0,148,6,SAM,I honestly don't know.I hope they can appreciate everything we've been through.what it all means for our continuing existence. In light of that I hope that they will understand why the people in charge chose to keep it a secret as long as they have.
0,148,6,EMMETT,*On screen* is it difficult to keep the secret?
0,148,6,SAM,"Ye.of all the things I do around here.in many ways that is the hardest.sometimes you look at what's going on, here on earth and it.I.It"
0,148,7,EMMETT,And stop it right there and go right to Dr Jackson.saying whether I was right.and your going to put me.into the carter half.especially the line.is it difficult to keep it a secret.
0,148,7,DALE,Ok.
0,148,7,EMMETT,Alright.
0,148,7,DANIEL,Whether I was right or not doesn't matter.especially given the scope of the truth.
0,148,7,EMMETT,*On screen* and the truth matters to you.
0,148,7,DANIEL,To everyone I hope.
0,148,7,EMMETT,*on screen* what truth Dr Jackson for the people here on Earth or are we talking about another planet.
0,148,7,DANIEL,We're talking about people here.People on other planets are no less human. People who have had their freedom reserved.people who are being forced to worship false gods and master in enslavement.
0,148,7,EMMETT,But what about the people here on earth are they entitled to the truth.do you think?
0,148,7,DANIEL,Is that what this is about?
0,148,7,EMMETT,*on screen* This. I'm not in control of when the airs.do you think this should get out.
0,148,7,EMMETT,Glad I cut to that.
0,148,7,EMMETT,*on screen* If it were up to you?
0,148,7,DANIEL,Well that's a complicated issue.
0,148,7,EMMETT,*on screen* No I'm asking you.Dr Jackson do you think that people on earth should know about this.
0,148,7,DANIEL,What do you think would happen?
0,148,7,EMMETT,*on screen* I think that people don't care much about what I think.
0,148,7,EMMETT,Okay cut that line.Nobody cares that nobody cares what I think.
0,148,7,EMMETT,*on screen* I haven't done what you've done Dr Jackson.I think people care what you think.
0,148,7,DANIEL,"Well, I think it's a relative question and it depends on your point of view."
0,148,7,EMMETT,*puts his head in his hands* oh.just stop it.this is terrible.
0,148,7,DALE,Really.because I think this is pretty interesting stuff.you know you did a good job at getting to express their true feelings.
0,148,7,EMMETT,"Yak, yak, yak, yak. It's a bunch of talking heads is what it is."
0,148,7,DALE,Personally I could watch Major Carters head talk all day.
0,148,7,EMMETT,"We need pictures, we need images to tell the story.what these people are doing here good or bad.makes the lunar landing look like we were testing our toes in the ocean.and what have we got to show for it.yak yak yak.nothing. Where's the equivalent shot of shepherd playing golf on the moon.we don't have it.Unbelievably boring."
0,148,8,DIXON,Hi Jack.thanks for coming.
0,148,8,JACK,I was told you said there was six Jaffa.where did you learn to count.
0,148,10,DIXON,"Ships didn't start coming down til it radioed you were through the gate. *Teal'c kills one, Jack another* something tells me they're throwing this party in your honor Jack.got those clips. *Jack passes spares.*"
0,148,10,AIRMAN,*On radio* Colonel O'Neill our position is being compromised.we're not gonna be able to hole the gate for long.
0,148,10,O'NEILL,*on radio* It doesn't matter we're not gonna be able to hold this position for that long. *Jack goes back to firing.*
0,148,10,JANET,"*on radio* Colonel I need more time to stabilize this patient, he can 't be moved yet."
0,148,10,SAM,Sir we got to fall back.*firing*
0,148,11,SAM,*real slow* sir! *gets up*
0,148,11,EMMETT,That's a 50 caliber right? You could really shake things up if you didn't know what you were doing.
0,148,11,DAVIS,No actually our guys are trained to use that kind of
0,148,11,EMMETT,I'm just kidding.What is this.Could you get a shot of this. *Two consoles in the corner.* what is this.could you explain how this operates.
0,148,11,DAVIS,Sure.err.our guys like to play a little space invaders when there's not much going on.
0,148,11,EMMETT,Ha-ha. Very funny.
0,148,11,DAVIS,No.obviously I'm kidding.err.certainly. It would be completely inappropriate for any airman to play video games while on active duty.
0,148,11,EMMETT,Ye I got it can we move on.
0,148,11,DAVIS,Sure.
0,148,11,EMMETT,Ok what's this.?
0,148,11,DAVIS,Err.right over here.is the manual override for the Iris.
0,148,11,EMMETT,are you kidding now.is that a joke?
0,148,11,DAVIS,No I'm serious.
0,148,11,EMMETT,How does it err.*Gate activates. Red light goes.you know the drill*
0,148,11,INCOMING WORMHOLE.,
0,148,11,EMMETT,What does that mean.?
0,148,11,TOM,We're gonna have to leave now.
0,148,11,EMMETT,"No.no keep shooting. Dale puts down the camera, but Emmett grabs it."
0,148,11,DALE,I can't do that sir.
0,148,11,EMMETT,I can do it.
0,148,11,HAMMOND,Remove that camera crew. Now! Moves the Camera to show Hammond and then all the SFs that surround Emmett.
0,148,11,SAM,*on radio* we are under fire and have serious casualties sir.we're coming in hot.
0,148,11,DAVIS,Receiving SG-1s Iris code sir. Emmett is being moved out of the room still looking over blast doors shut.
0,148,11,HAMMOND,Open the Iris.
0,148,11,TOM,This way sir.
0,148,11,HAMMOND,Medical team to the gate room. Emmett out the camera down still on facing behind them. We see the blast doors open as the med team walks through.Someone's on a gurney which is rushed passed.
0,148,11,TOM,Clear this area. Tom notices the Cameras on turns it off.
0,148,11,EMMETT,Sorry about that. *throws the camera at dale* Here take the damn thing.
0,148,11,DALE,In future sir.could you leave the camera work to me.
0,148,11,EMMETT,Ye alright I'll leave it to you.*we see Sam coming down the corridor being escorted be two sf.* Okay here I'll leave it to you here she comes.You turn it on lets go.
0,148,12,EMMETT,Don't look at him we're cleared to shoot here. Just follow me. *rushes towards Sam* and bring that.bring the sound. Major.what happened.
0,148,12,SAM,"Please *holds her hand up to him, she's crying*"
0,148,12,EMMETT,Now I know that at least one person was injured back there. *still moving* and all I want to say is.
0,148,12,SAM,Look leave me alone and shut that damn thing off. *Dale shuts off Camera*
0,148,12,EMMETT,*tries to follow Sam but SF stops him* Look I just want to say how sorry I am.*looks at the other as Dale switches off the light on his
0,148,17,EMMETT,Hey.How you doing?...Don't suppose you know anything about what's going on.all I can.
0,148,18,SHEP,There are multiple injuries; at least two people were hit with staff blasts. *both sit down*.
0,148,18,EMMETT,How do you know?
0,148,18,SHEP,"There was a fire fight of some kind apparently one of the teams got ambushed.so they sent in SG1, SG5, Fraiser and a medical team to extract them."
0,148,18,EMMETT,Someone from the original team must have been badly hurt or Fraiser wouldn't have gone in at all.
0,148,18,DALE,One of the nurses says there was a casualty.
0,148,18,EMMETT,"Casualty?...someone die?? *Dale nods, as Tom enters*"
0,148,18,DALE,She wouldn't say who.
0,148,18,EMMETT,Well Carters a seasoned officer she wouldn't be crying unless *they all look at Tom who looks grave.* I mean we hear someone may actually have died.what have you got.
0,148,18,TOM,O'Neill.
0,148,18,EMMETT,Sure?
0,148,18,TOM,No I heard O'Neill was on a gurney.took a blast.he's not moving.
0,148,19,TOM,General Hammond sir. Mr. Woolsey
0,148,19,WOOLSEY,General. *Handing Hammond a file.*
0,148,19,HAMMOND,I already know these orders originated from Senator Kinsey's office. Why don't you tell me the rest.
0,148,19,WOOLSEY,"As chairmen of the intelligence oversight committee, Senator Kinsey has asked that I review your command decision regarding the recent attempted rescue of SG-13."
0,148,19,HAMMOND,Attempted?
0,148,19,WOOLSEY,As I understand it there were several casualties sir.I'd hardly call it a success.
0,148,19,HAMMOND,My command decisions are reviewed by the chief of staff of the air force and the president of the United States.as of yet I haven't even filed a preliminary mission report.when I do you are welcome to read it.
0,148,19,WOOLSEY,I have been authorized to begin a full investigation into the matter as part of a larger examination of SGC's strategic policy that the
0,148,21,TOM,General
0,148,21,HAMMOND,How are you holding up?
0,148,21,SAM,I'm okay sir.
0,148,21,HAMMOND,Did you talk to agent Barrett?
0,148,21,SAM,"*nodding* He said as far as he knows Woolsey is clean. But he did say he's as sharp as they come. He's got an MBA and an LLP from Harvard. He was a lead council for the army Corp of engineers for 10 years, and later sat on the defense policy board. He was asked to resign last year when it was disclosed that he had financial ties to a large corporation that had been awarded over 8 hundred million dollars in private sector defense contracts by the pentagon.He's been with the NID since then. Barrett faxed me this internal NID memo Woolsey recently wrote I think you should read it. *Hammond looks through file* what do we do sir?"
0,148,21,HAMMOND,Just tell the truth.
0,148,21,SAM,*nodding* Yes sir
0,148,21,HAMMOND,There's going to be a memorial service on Wednesday. I think it would be appropriate if you said a few words.
0,148,21,SAM,*swallowing back tears* Yes sir. *Hammond moves to leave* sir. *He stops* How are you holding up?
0,148,21,HAMMOND,"You try to tell yourself that every man and woman under your command means the same to you. Each has to be equally valuable if you're going to make the kind of decisions that affect their lives the way I have to. But you can't help it. You get closer to some people *Sam nodding, fighting tears* you never want to lose anyone.*deep breath*.yup *Hammond leaves*"
0,148,22,WOOLSEY,Have a seat Major. Let me explain why I am here.
0,148,22,SAM,I know why you're here. *sitting*
0,148,22,WOOLSEY,"*walking over, starting video* I believe classified military operations require oversight."
0,148,22,SAM,This isn't the first time we've been scrutinized by the NID.
0,148,22,WOOLSEY,"I know the stakes around here are always high, but there were serious casualties in this instance. Someone of great value to this"
0,148,23,SAM,"I know that, don't you dare think anyone is taking it lightly."
0,148,23,WOOLSEY,"You're a seasoned combat officer and this is not the first time you have lost a close colleague *going and pouring himself a glass of water* and I doubt it will be the last. I just want to make sure that it wasn't *walking over* avoidable in this case, despite what you might think, the only reason I'm here is to get the truth."
0,148,23,SAM,Did you have a question.
0,148,23,WOOLSEY,*Close up on his face* Oh yes a few.what made you think it *walking around.Daniel.*
0,148,23,DANIEL,It's not really my call.
0,148,23,WOOLSEY,"*camera following him as he moves round table.* But you though it was worth risking the lives of an SG team, to get an Ariel survey of these ruins? *pans on Sam*"
0,148,23,SAM,"The device was damaged, it took a while to get a proper interface and the memory crystal contained an enormous amount of information."
0,148,23,WOOLSEY,So you would have me believe that this was an acceptable risk?
0,148,23,DANIEL,This is what we do.
0,148,23,WOOLSEY,Make bad decisions.
0,148,23,DANIEL,"Yeah it's easy to predict the score when the game is over, and if we had found powerful weapons in those ruins capable of defending the planet from the Goa'uld, we wouldn't be having this conversation."
0,148,23,WOOLSEY,But you didn't and we are. *Daniel nods* I fact If there had been powerful weapons in those ruins they would now be in the hands of the Goa' uld. The fact is that this mission was botched from the beginning to the end.
0,148,23,SAM,"We don't just leave people behind. You can't ask airmen, soldiers.Human beings to risk their lives without backup, without knowing that we would be there for them."
0,148,23,WOOLSEY,"You yourself have been asked to go into combat where you knew there was no back up. That is always a possibility on any mission through the stargate is it not? *Sam stares obviously pissed* And please Major, none of us like to admit it but we all know that there are military situations in which the life of one human being had to be considered an acceptable loss."
0,148,23,SAM,That wasn't the case here.
0,148,23,WOOLSEY,"No in this case, it was just dumb luck that there wasn't many more lives lost."
0,148,23,SAM,"*a little louder* I would say it was skill, training and fortitude."
0,148,23,WOOLSEY,"Based on your expertise in Goa'uld tac-tics. Was it not reasonable to conclude that this was an ambush? *Pans onto Teal'c who remains Silent* While you are not an official member of our military and not eligible for court-martial, I shouldn't have to remind you that you are expected to follow the orders of your superiors."
0,148,23,TEAL'C,As I was doing on the day in question.
0,148,23,WOOLSEY,"If you fail to testify here today, *leans down revealing Daniel* I will have you jailed until such time that you do."
0,148,23,DANIEL,"*picks up mic* you fire me, you throw me in jail.you do what you want. *throws mic, gets up and leave*"
0,148,23,EMMETT,Dr Jackson.
0,148,23,DANIEL,Yeah.It's really not a good time now.
0,148,23,EMMETT,"I just been hearing bits and pieces, I was just hoping you might be able to confirm some of it."
0,148,23,DANIEL,Sorry.
0,148,23,EMMETT,"*Looking at video camera, bloody finger print on it* did you.?"
0,148,24,BOSWORTH,It'll be alright Simon hang in there alright buddy will be home before you know it. *sounds of gun fire.* OVER HERE!! *Daniel and Janet come running* Man down. Over here. They're here. There's a lot of blood coming from underneath him. *moving* I'll cover you from the ridge.
0,148,24,JANET,I'm Dr Janet Fraiser. Can you hear me?
0,148,24,WELLS,"*Gasping out, muffled,"
0,148,25,DANIEL,*Trying to keep his mind occupied so he won't think of the pain*
0,148,26,WELLS,Senior Airman Wells ... Simon Wells ... *Panicky* Am I gonna die? ...
0,148,26,JANET,"Not if I have anything to do with it. OK, we need to roll him over, and stop the bleeding ...OK? Simon, you hanging in there? OK ...easy ... Allright on three ... one ... two ... three ... *Wells screams out in pain as the docs turn him onto his back*"
0,148,26,DANIEL,"*Calming voice as the Airman gasps, and pants, in SERIOUS pain!* I'm Daniel Jackson ..."
0,148,26,WELLS,"I know, I know ... SG-1 ..."
0,148,26,DANIEL,
0,148,26,WELLS,Son of a bitch ... he came out of NOWHERE! Shot me in the back ...
0,148,26,DANIEL,"Let's talk about something else right now, Simon ... What's going on at home right now?"
0,148,26,WELLS,My wife ... she's pregnant ...
0,148,26,DANIEL,"Yeah?! This, uh ... this your first? ... congratulations"
0,148,27,JANET,That's good! At least you felt that!
0,148,27,SOLDIER,Colonel O'Neill! Our positions been compromised! We're not gonna be able to hold the gate very long ...
0,148,28,JANET,Colonel! I need more time to stabilize this patient ... he can't be moved yet ...
0,148,28,WELLS,You can't help me! Leave me!
0,148,28,JANET,Nobody is going anywhere ...
0,148,28,WELLS,I can't believe I'm not gonna see my son!
0,148,28,DANIEL,"Ok, just stay focused, stay focused ... So, it ... it"
0,148,29,WELLS,"Tell me the truth ... I'm not gonna make it, right??"
0,148,29,DANIEL,You're gonna be fine ...
0,148,29,WELLS,Doctor Jackson ... Please! Please! Just let me tell my wife! Let me tell my wife that ...
0,148,29,DANIEL,"Ok, OK!"
0,148,29,JANET,"Got it ... breathe, Simon ... It's ok, Simon ..."
0,148,30,DANIEL,I said: 'Now's not a good idea.' What part of that didn't you understand?
0,148,30,EMMETT,"You go something on tape, didn't you?"
0,148,30,DANNY,": Get out, get out."
0,148,30,EMMETT,"Okay, I will.. alright."
0,148,31,EMMETT,"You know.. I once did a piece on this war photographer, his name's Martin Kristofsky. For six months he was with a unit in Vietnam and the day before he was schedule to leave. The day before.. he's out with the unit and it was just a routine patrol or so they thought but suddenly, the Lieutenant pulled him down and Kristophzky hadn't intended to take a picture at that moment but his hands were on the camera and he hit the ground so hard that it just went off. The picture captured the Lieutenant getting shot in the head and Kristophzky said to me, ""Well that bullet would of hit me, should of hit me."" And he never showed that picture to anyone. Not for 25 years, but 25 years later he got up one morning and he looked at that picture and he saw something that wasn't horrific and he decided to tell the story because he realized that he hadn't accidentally taken a picture of a man dying. It was of a man saving his life. The picture I'm making, that I'm trying to make is about what you people do every single day. Under extreme circumstances that no one can even imagine and I don't know what happened out there, I'm sorry about whatever it was and if you did tape something of it.. that's not gonna change what happened. What it will change is how you feel about it."
0,148,32,HAMMOND,I've prepared a written testimony.
0,148,32,WOOLSEY,This is your mission report.
0,148,32,HAMMOND,I thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
0,148,32,WOOLSEY,Well then.I guess I'm done.
0,148,32,HAMMOND,Then you'll be leaving
0,148,32,WOOLSEY,The president will have my preliminary report by the end of the week.
0,148,32,HAMMOND,I'm sure it will be every bit as interesting as your memo on the economics of the
0,148,32,WOOLSEY,I won't bother asking how you got that.
0,148,32,HAMMOND,What was the dollar value you attributed to an SG team member?
0,148,32,WOOLSEY,You know damn well I wasn't pegging the value of a person's life. It is a cold hard fact that it costs millions of dollars to train these men and women and that is a fraction of the funds being subverted by the pentagon for this operation. *standing* I think it is reprehensible that the tax payers of this country are paying enormous sums of money to wage a war they know nothing about and are getting little if anything in return. If the Stargate's existence were public knowledge and your actions were being judged in the court of public opinion.
0,148,32,HAMMOND,You're the one suggesting that sending a rescue team worth 27 million dollars to save the life of one man is a bad business decision.
0,148,32,WOOLSEY,You're putting words in my mouth.
0,148,32,HAMMOND,"You said it in black and white and I don't think you would dare do such a thing if this wasn't a classified operation. The president has asked a documentary team to get to the truth of what is going on around here. Why don't we just go down and give them the whole truth as you see it, Right now."
0,148,32,WOOLSEY,"*Closing his files glaring at Hammond* That memo is classified, this investigation is classified, and if you so much as utter even a hint of either I'll see you are put away in a cold dark place for the rest of time. *leaves*"
0,148,32,SCENE,"Corridor, Tom bumps into Hammond."
0,148,32,TOM,General.
0,148,32,HAMMOND,What is it colonel?
0,148,32,TOM,Security caught Mr. Bregman trying to access the infirmary sir. He claims he was lost but I have shown him all around this Complex.
0,148,32,HAMMOND,Get rid of him
0,148,32,TOM,Sir? Have our orders changed Sir?
0,148,32,HAMMOND,Toss him out on his ass Colonel. *walks away*
0,148,32,EMMETT,What's this.What's going on?
0,148,32,TOM,"Mr. Bregman sir, General Hammond has ordered you off the base."
0,148,32,EMMETT,"No, no he can't do that."
0,148,32,SHEP,He is a General.
0,148,32,EMMETT,You stop packing. *Walks out*
0,148,32,TOM,Keep packing.
0,148,32,HAMMOND,You have one hour to get off my base and out of my sight forever.
0,148,32,EMMETT,Whose authority?
0,148,32,HAMMOND,My superior.
0,148,32,EMMETT,You think I stepped over the line. I don't. I just want to make a phone call.
0,148,32,HAMMOND,"Call whoever you want on your way out, there's a payphone in the service."
0,148,32,EMMETT,actually I'd like to borrow your red one.
0,148,32,HAMMOND,You have some nerve Mr. Bregman.
0,148,32,EMMETT,*Moving towards phone* that's what my mother used to say.
0,148,33,HAMMOND,"I've been ordered to turn over the tape.Look, I'm not happy about it either. I could fight it, the tape could get lost or accidentally erase, these things happen. But, I'm not going to do that. I had that little weasel of a man thrown out of here, but in light of the NID's latest investigation I'm starting to think maybe that there should be a record of what goes on here beyond the classified reports."
0,148,33,DANNY,And you trust Bregman to portray that?
0,148,33,HAMMOND,At the moment I have no other choice.
0,148,33,SCENE,"Briefing room. Daniel walks in, slams the tape down on the table, walks out"
0,148,33,EMMETT,Hey.Hey *throwing Dale the tape* I got the tape put it on.
0,148,34,TOM,Preliminary mission reports have been de-classified.
0,148,34,EMMETT,Just a minute. *on tape*
0,148,34,DANIEL,Ok you tell her yourself *camera on wells*

0,148,35,WELLS,"Yes Ma'am Sound of staff blast, bright flash of light shoots past the screen as it hits Janet square in the chest the force throwing her back with a cry."

0,148,37,JACK,Yeah.err.*pulling down his t-shirt* still a little tender but they said I could go home.
0,148,37,SAM,We're lucky that staff blast hit you where it did. That new vest inserts works well.
0,148,37,JACK,Didn't help Fraiser much.
0,148,37,SAM,*breathing in* no
0,148,37,JACK,"*after a moments silence, gets up to get his shirt* How's Cassie?"

0,148,38,JACK,"C'mere. Jack Pulls Sam into a hug, which she returns, him turning his face into her neck."
0,148,38,WELLS,Doctor Jackson.
0,148,38,JACKSON,"Hey. Please, just call me Daniel. So I hear you're gonna make a full recovery."
0,148,38,WELLS,So they say.
0,148,38,JACKSON,You talk to your wife?
0,148,38,WELLS,Yeah.
0,148,38,JACKSON,Everythings ok?
0,148,38,WELLS,Yeah.
0,148,38,JACKSON,I never asked you when she was due.
0,148,38,WELLS,A couple of weeks. They say I should be out of here by then.
0,148,38,JACKSON,That's great.
0,148,38,WELLS,Yeah.
0,148,38,JACKSON,"I just wanted to see how you were doing, so...."
0,148,38,WELLS,She's dead because of me.
0,148,38,JACKSON,"No, no. She's dead because a Jaffa shot her. She was doing her job. The same way you were doing yours when a Jaffa shot you."
0,148,38,WELLS,I can't make it feel right.
0,148,38,JACKSON,It wasn't right. Nothing about it was right. But it also wasn't your fault.
0,148,39,CARTER,Hey Teal'c. General Hammond asked me to speak at the memorial service.
0,148,39,TEAL'C,I am aware.
0,148,39,CARTER,"I don't know what to say, nothing seems good enough."
0,148,39,TEAL'C,I believe you should only speak from your heart.
0,148,39,CARTER,I gotta go pick up Cassie.
0,148,39,TEAL'C,Major Carter. I have pondered what I would say were I given the chance.
0,148,39,CARTER,Really?
0,148,39,TEAL'C,But I believe it would be best if it came from you. He hands her a piece of paper. She reads it and smiles. They hug.
0,148,40,JACKSON,Over here.
0,148,40,BRIGMAN,Oh. I was told that you might be in here Doctor Jackson.
0,148,40,JACKSON,Yep.
0,148,40,BRIGMAN,I just came back to give this back to you.
0,148,41,BRIGMAN,I'm not gonna use it.
0,148,41,JACKSON,"Wait. I want you to. You know I died in this room? Ascended. Doctor Fraiser did everything she could. I mean, she went three days without sleep. Even in the end she didn't wanna let me go. I owed her a lot more than I ever gave back. I thought a lot about what you said about Kristofski. I think this shows what Janet Fraiser was all about."
0,148,41,BRIGMAN,Me too.
0,148,41,JACKSON,"I want other people to know. He hands him back the tape. The memorial service. Jack, Teal'c and Sam are on the right, while Daniel, Hammond and Walter are on the left. The last post is played and Sam goes to the podium."
0,148,41,CARTER,"Janet Fraiser was an extraordinary person. She was kind and funny and talented. Above all, she was courageous. Try as I might I could not find the words to honour her. To do justice to her life. Thankfully I got some help. While words alone may not be enough. There are some names that might do.We often talk about those that give their their lives in the service of their country, and while Janet Fraiser did just that. That's not what her life was about. The following are the names of the men and women who did not die in service, but who are in fact alive today because of Janet."
0,148,42,HAMMOND,It's a shame no-one's ever going to see it.
0,148,42,BRIGMAN,Really? You don't think it's a little sentimental.
0,148,42,HAMMOND,"No, it's good."
0,148,42,BRIGMAN,Well that's a relief. Hearing that from you of all people. Especially given how you felt about what I was doing. I mean I understood
0,148,43,HAMMOND,I'm a big enough man to admit when I'm wrong. I'm glad you stuck with it.
0,148,43,BRIGMAN,That means a lot to me sir.
0,148,43,HAMMOND,I've written a lot of letters to the next of kin. Nothing ever seems like it's enough. They deserved more. This is something more.
0,148,43,BRIGMAN,"Thankyou sir. Um, there is one thing General that's still missing, that could make a difference."
0,148,44,WELLS,"Hey, come in. Daniel this is my wife Marcey."
0,148,44,MARCEY,"Hi, I'd love to give you a hug but...."
0,148,44,WELLS,This is my daughter.
0,148,44,JACKSON,She is beautiful.
0,148,44,MARCEY,Thanks.
0,148,44,JACKSON,I guess the ultrasound was wrong huh?
0,148,44,MARCEY,Yeah.
0,148,44,JACKSON,What's her name.
0,148,44,WELLS,Janet.
0,148,44,JACKSON,That's nice. Jack sits in a chair ready to finally give Emmet his interview.
0,148,44,BRIGMAN,Ok Tom. You ready?
0,148,44,CAMERAMAN,Rolling.
0,148,44,BRIGMAN,Ok. First question.
0,148,44,O'NEILL,Ok.
