0,150,0,"""INAUGURATION""",By Paul Mullie & Joseph Mallozzi
0,150,1,CHIEF OF STAFF,"The Nike dropped eight percent last night, and the yen continued its freefall. Also the President of Togo was deposed about six hours ago. He managed to get a plane to Nigeria; now he's calling for American troops to help restore order."
0,150,1,HAYES,This is my first day.
0,150,1,CHIEF OF STAFF,"Yes, Mr. President. The New York Times is about to launch an investigation into voting irregularities in six southern states. I've got Teddy on it."
0,150,2,CHIEF OF STAFF,"They work for you, Mr. President. Also there's a storm in the Atlantic about to hit the coast of Maine. They're expecting gale force winds and twenty inches of snow."
0,150,3,HAYES,Shouldn't I know who they are?
0,150,3,CHIEF OF STAFF,"Yes, Mr. President. Emergency management teams are standing by, but we've scheduled a call to the governor for ten o'clock so that you can pledge your support."
0,150,4,HAYES,They're not going to follow me around all the time are they?
0,150,4,CHIEF OF STAFF,"No, Mr. President."
0,150,4,HAYES,Good. Hello. Holly.
0,150,4,CHIEF OF STAFF,The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is waiting for you in your office.
0,150,4,HAYES,"*He* knows it's my first day, right?"
0,150,4,CHIEF OF STAFF,"Yes, Mr. President."
0,150,4,HAYES,Good.
0,150,4,HAYES,Francis.
0,150,4,MAYNARD,"Mr. President. We need to talk, sir. It's important."
0,150,4,HAYES,Guys! Let me enjoy the moment.
0,150,4,MAYNARD,"The moment is over, sir."
0,150,4,HAYES,"Right. Stan, thank you. Thank you."
0,150,5,MAYNARD,Mr. President. I'm here to bring you up to speed on a program we've been running out of Cheyenne Mountain for the past seven years.
0,150,5,HAYES,I've already had my top secret briefing.
0,150,5,MAYNARD,"Yes Mr. President, but not this. Mr. President, for the past seven years, the United States Air Force has been sending teams to other planets by means of an alien device known as a Stargate."
0,150,5,HAYES,"That's funny. That's very funny. My first day. This is a joke, right? I have a great sense of humor. I didn't know that you had one, but this is good because we're finding out about each other. Now I have to call the ex-President of Togo, and when I'm done, apparently the rest of the world is coming to an end."
0,150,5,MAYNARD,"The ex-President of Togo will have to wait, sir. This is not a joke."
0,150,6,HAYES,The United States Air Force has been sending people to other planets?
0,150,6,MAYNARD,"Yes, sir."
0,150,6,HAYES,For the last seven years.
0,150,6,MAYNARD,That's correct.
0,150,6,HAYES,By means of an alien device?
0,150,6,MAYNARD,Known as the Stargate.
0,150,8,SARA,Senator McKnight is requesting we move your meeting to next week.
0,150,8,KINSEY,He's trying to duck me. Doesn't wanna commit on the crime bill.
0,150,8,SARA,What shall I tell him?
0,150,8,KINSEY,Forget it! The son of a bitch came in on our coat tails. Now it's time to pay the piper.
0,150,9,HAYES,What the hell were you thinking?!
0,150,9,SARA,Mr. President.
0,150,9,HAYES,Why didn't you tell me?!
0,150,9,KINSEY,"Sara, would you excuse us for a moment, please? I take it you've just been briefed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs on our new reality."
0,150,9,HAYES,"Not only do I find out that the Air Force is engaged in interstellar travel, but I also find out that my running mate knows all about it!"
0,150,9,KINSEY,I was under a special executive gag order.
0,150,9,HAYES,Since when?!
0,150,9,KINSEY,A little over six years now.
0,150,9,HAYES,That's unbelievable!
0,150,9,KINSEY,"Mr. President, I realize this is a little overwhelming right now, but what you really need to know is that the Stargate is being seriously mis-managed. It's urgent that we act now."
0,150,9,HAYES,What are you talking about?
0,150,9,KINSEY,"I have desperately tried to maintain some proper control and accountability, but the oversight in place is completely inadequate. The military, specifically the personnel directly involved in the SGC, need to be replaced immediately. Now, I have several recommendations regarding..."
0,150,9,HAYES,"Whoa, Bob, hold on here!"
0,150,9,KINSEY,"Mr. President, why do you think I was ordered to keep quiet? This was a deliberate attempt by the military, and the previous administration, to drive a wedge between us, because they knew I was gonna come after them. We need to stick together on this."
0,150,9,HAYES,"For God's sake, Bob, think of the magnitude of this!"
0,150,9,KINSEY,For God's sake is right.
0,150,9,HAYES,"Oh come on, Bob! If you want me to buy into your holier than thou position, you've gotta convince me you're right!"
0,150,10,HAYES,Hosted alien dignitaries. Acquired alien technology. Traveled back in time?! Did they really blow up a sun?
0,150,10,MAYNARD,"As I understand it, sir, yes they did."
0,150,10,HAYES,"It's gotta look awfully good on the old resume, hey?"
0,150,10,MAYNARD,"Yes, sir. They've done some pretty amazing things."
0,150,10,HAYES,"You sound like a fan, Francis."
0,150,10,MAYNARD,"Well, I can't help but appreciate the number of times they've saved this world."
0,150,10,HAYES,Some people think this world wouldn't have needed saving had we left well enough alone.
0,150,10,MAYNARD,"Well, you can't deny what's out there, sir. The enemy would have come for us anyway. We need to be prepared and no matter what anyone says, the people at the SGC have done the best job anyone could under the circumstances."
0,150,10,HAYES,You don't trust the Vice President.
0,150,10,MAYNARD,He obviously has his own agenda.
0,150,10,HAYES,I know he tried to shut 'em down when he was at Appropriations.
0,150,10,MAYNARD,"Well, frankly, I think the Vice President knows as well as anyone else, it's too late for that. If he didn't six years ago, he certainly does now."
0,150,10,HAYES,What does that mean?
0,150,10,MAYNARD,He clearly doesn't want to shut the Gate down anymore. He wants to control it.
0,150,11,KINSEY,"We have a civilian agency known as the NID. Now its mandate has been to keep an eye on top secret projects like the Stargate program, and has done so from the beginning. I propose that we give this organization direct control of the Gate, effective immediately."
0,150,12,MAYNARD,There's only one reason he wanted them to give control to the NID.
0,150,12,HAYES,Because he was about to become Chairman of the Intelligence Oversight Committee.
0,150,12,MAYNARD,Which would put the NID and the Stargate in his back pocket. He had the ambassadors eating out of his hands. It was only because of some extraordinary intervention that it didn't work.
0,150,14,BRITISH AMBASSADOR,Hello?
0,150,14,THOR,"Hello. I am Thor, Supreme Commander of the Asgard fleet."
0,150,14,KINSEY,"Commander Thor, my name is ..."
0,150,14,THOR,Senator Kinsey. O'Neill suggested I send you to a distant planet for your actions here but I am reasonably certain his statement was in jest.
0,150,14,KINSEY,"I'm sure it was, Commander ..."
0,150,14,THOR,"*Supreme* Commander. It is the opinion of the Asgard High Council that Stargate Command should be left in the very capable hands of General Hammond and his team. And while our continued friendship with Earth is not contingent on that, it is preferred."
0,150,15,HAYES,"I wonder why he wants it so badly. I mean, besides his belief in his divine right."
0,150,15,MAYNARD,"I don't know, sir."
0,150,15,HAYES,"Not that that's not enough, but I get this feeling that there's something more to it."
0,150,15,MAYNARD,"Yes, sir."
0,150,15,HAYES,That rogue element at NID that he took credit for taking down last year...
0,150,15,MAYNARD,We've never had any proof connecting Senator Kinsey to anything nefarious.
0,150,15,HAYES,I'm starting to get a bad feeling about where some of that campaign financing came from.
0,150,15,MAYNARD,Mr. President.
0,150,15,HAYES,... Did I say that out loud?
0,150,16,KINSEY,"Ah, Mr. Woolsey. I hope my confidence in you has not been misplaced."
0,150,16,WOOLSEY,"You have my word, sir. Once I've finished presenting the evidence, the President will have no choice but to follow your recommendation and clean house at Stargate Command."
0,150,17,MAYNARD,"I'm sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. President, but I was just wrapping up a meeting with the Joint Chiefs when I got your message."
0,150,17,HAYES,"Francis, I thought you'd want to sit in on this one."
0,150,17,MAYNARD,"Thank you, sir."
0,150,17,KINSEY,"General, I don't believe you know Richard Woolsey. For the past several months he has been working with the NID conducting a thorough investigation of all Stargate personnel. I've asked him here to kindly present us with his findings."
0,150,17,MAYNARD,"If this is a discussion about the competence of those running the SGC, shouldn't George Hammond be included?"
0,150,17,WOOLSEY,"Unfortunately, sir, General Hammond is part of the problem."
0,150,17,MAYNARD,"George Hammond is a highly decorated officer, a thirty year veteran with the United States Air Force, and while that may not carry a lot of weight over at the NID, it still means something to certain people in this town."
0,150,17,WOOLSEY,"This isn't a trial, General. Although it certainly wouldn't surprise me if it came to that."
0,150,17,HAYES,"Let's stick to specifics here. If these people need to be replaced, I wanna see evidence."
0,150,17,WOOLSEY,"Thank you, Mr. President. The most recent incident was less than a month ago. General Hammond ordered an off-world rescue operation despite ample indication that he was sending his people into an ambush. As a result, a very valuable member of Stargate Command was killed, Doctor Janet Fraiser."
0,150,17,MAYNARD,Sending your people into potentially dangerous situations is a natural consequence of military command.
0,150,17,WOOLSEY,"Maybe so, but ignoring evidence of an enemy trap is at best foolish and at worst criminally negligent. General Hammond admits his responsibility. His own report is essentially a confession."
0,150,17,MAYNARD,All that proves is that the man had the guts to own up to his mistakes.
0,150,17,WOOLSEY,"Unfortunately in this case, mistakes can lead to compromising the entire planet. I've uncovered a mountain of evidence implicating not only General Hammond but his first-line team as well."
0,150,17,MAYNARD,Those people are heroes.
0,150,17,KINSEY,We have no intention of minimizing the accomplishments of either the General or SG-1. Their respective achievements speak for themselves. But intermittent successes cannot excuse ongoing misconduct.
0,150,17,WOOLSEY,"Over the past seven years, SG-1 has shown a disregard for military authority. They have compromised national security and exercised extremely poor judgment in the performance of their duties."
0,150,17,HAYES,"You should be on my speech writing team! Come on, cut the crap, will ya? As crazy as it sounds, we're sitting around here talking about people who are fighting aliens, right? Could we please be specific?"
0,150,17,WOOLSEY,"Yes, sir. Let's start with insubordination. Approximately five and a half years ago the Gate was shut down. The SGC was under orders to suspend all offworld travel pending a full review. SG-1 chose to ignore those orders."
0,150,17,MAYNARD,And in the process they managed to head off an invasion.
0,150,17,WOOLSEY,Nonetheless they were guilty. And it was by no means an isolated incident.
0,150,19,CARTER,Let's go.
0,150,20,TEAL'C,O'Neill!
0,150,20,O'NEILL,"Not this time, Teal'c."
0,150,22,MAYNARD,They sabotaged a mothership the Goa'uld would have eventually used to attack Earth.
0,150,22,WOOLSEY,They used the Stargate against the direct order of a superior officer.
0,150,22,MAYNARD,You can't hold them accountable for that. Read the damn mission report. They were under the influence of an alien device.
0,150,22,WOOLSEY,Yes of course. Which brings us to the alarming frequency with which members of SG-1 have fallen under alien influence. Major Samantha Carter: implanted with a Goa'uld symbiote; then two years ago her body became host to an alien virus.
0,150,25,WOOLSEY,"Daniel Jackson: fell under the influence of alien technology on numerous occasions. Had his body play host to not one but twelve alien psyches simultaneously. Most interestingly of all, apparently died and according to the report, evolved into a higher being."
0,150,28,WOOLSEY,"Teal'c, an alien. Former soldier of the Goa'uld. Now possesses full security clearance at our most secret facility."
0,150,28,MAYNARD,He earned that trust.
0,150,28,WOOLSEY,"Yes, that trust almost cost SG-1 dearly when he rejoined the ranks of the System Lord Apophis."
0,150,29,O'NEILL,"Buddy! Whatcha got goin' here, Teal'c?"
0,150,31,MAYNARD,He'd been brainwashed by the enemy.
0,150,31,WOOLSEY,"Yes. Like his fellow team members, he too has shown a vulnerability to alien influence. Which finally brings us to the team leader, Jack O'Neill. Infected by alien contagions a half dozen times; experimented upon by extraterrestrials another half dozen times. Had his memories manipulated on numerous occasions. Had the entire repository of an Ancient alien database effectively downloaded into his head."
0,150,33,O'NEILL,Whoa!
0,150,34,CARTER,Colonel!
0,150,35,WOOLSEY,"Not long after this incident the Colonel began exhibiting strange behavior: speaking an alien language, demonstrating super-human intellect. As it turns out, he was undergoing some sort of transformation as a result of the knowledge he had absorbed. Were it not for the timely intervention of another alien race, he would have been lost to us."
0,150,35,HAYES,How these people maintain their sanity is beyond me. I'm having trouble just sitting here listening to it.
0,150,35,WOOLSEY,"That, Mr. President, is exactly my point. How can we trust these individuals to protect our planet after everything they've been through?"
0,150,35,HAYES,Well they seem to be handling it very well.
0,150,35,WOOLSEY,But who's to say they are completely free of these influences?
0,150,35,MAYNARD,They're routinely checked and cleared by medical professionals.
0,150,35,WOOLSEY,"We can no longer allow the Pentagon to look the other way. The number of times the members of SG-1 have been compromised should have warranted at least a reconsideration of their offworld status. Transfers to less decisive positions. A couple of sick days, for God's sake!"
0,150,35,HAYES,"The first time I heard about this, I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I try to imagine myself doing what these people have been doing for the last seven years, and quite frankly I don't think any of us can really understand what they've been going through, no matter how many files we read."
0,150,35,WOOLSEY,"All the more reason for intensive scrutiny. If new protocols and standards of conduct need to be established, this is where it has to start."
0,150,35,HAYES,What do you say we take a break?
0,150,35,MAYNARD,"Yes, sir."
0,150,36,KINSEY,You can't possibly be taking their side.
0,150,36,HAYES,"I need time to absorb this, Bob."
0,150,36,KINSEY,We may not have much time. The longer those people...
0,150,36,HAYES,"Relax. All I'm saying is, at the moment I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt. I need to know more."
0,150,36,KINSEY,I think you know all you need to know and that includes why you're here.
0,150,36,HAYES,"I'm here, Bob, because the people of this nation elected me to run their country, not the whole damn galaxy. And this is my office, Bob, not yours, no matter what you may think you did to make this happen. And don't you ever for one second forget that."
0,150,36,KINSEY,"Yes, Mr. President."
0,150,36,HAYES,Let's take a break.
0,150,37,WOOLSEY,"According to the military, Stargate Command is our first and best line of defense against potential alien threats to this planet. If that's true, we should be very, very concerned. Time and again General Hammond and SG-1 have demonstrated shockingly poor judgment, placing themselves, the base, this very planet in jeopardy. The decision to bring back suspect technology through the Gate has precipitated a number of crisis situations. For the most part they've been dealt with within the confines of the SGC. However, last year, the effect of an alien device broke containment and found its way into the civilian population."
0,150,39,VERNON,Ugh! Son of a ...
0,150,40,O'NEILL,"Sir, I have reason to believe an individual I came in contact with has breached the quarantine."
0,150,42,MAYNARD,"The situation was taken care of, a cover story was created and the civilian population was none the wiser."
0,150,42,KINSEY,"Well, I for one would like to know how many more times we're gonna have to clean up after these people."
0,150,42,MAYNARD,"They have a mandate to acquire offworld technology, and that entails necessary risks."
0,150,42,WOOLSEY,"And how would you define 'necessary'? Only a few months ago, General Hammond allowed the testing of an unproven computer virus that infected and shut down our entire Gate network, leaving us open to a potential planetary assault."
0,150,42,MAYNARD,You can't hold Hammond responsible for that! It was a Goa'uld modification of the virus that caused the problem.
0,150,42,WOOLSEY,"In other words, General Hammond effectively gave the Goa'uld a weapon to use against us."
0,150,42,MAYNARD,"Like the President said, you can't even begin to understand what their jobs demand of them."
0,150,42,WOOLSEY,"Maybe not, but I would like to think that it includes common sense and the willingness to set aside personal feelings in the heat of battle."
0,150,42,HAYES,"What are you referring to, Mr. Woolsey?"
0,150,42,WOOLSEY,An incident three years ago when General Hammond allowed emotion to override established Gateroom protocol.
0,150,44,HAMMOND,"Evacuate the Gateroom. Colonel O'Neill, we're taking fire. Report. Colonel O'Neill?"
0,150,44,DAVIS,Sir?
0,150,44,HAMMOND,Give them some more time.
0,150,46,WOOLSEY,"General Hammond's decision to wait for SG-1 worked out in the end, but I can't help but wonder if he'll be so lucky the next time. The members of SG-1 have similarly suspect priorities, and no wonder. Not one, but two people that Doctor Jackson had close personal relationships with were taken as Goa'uld hosts. Teal'c's family and associates among the ranks of the enemy Jaffa make him an easy target for Goa'uld retaliation and manipulation. And both Colonel O'Neill and Major Carter have demonstrated an alarming tendency to let interpersonal relationships cloud their decision-making process."
0,150,46,HAYES,"They have a right to their feelings. Unless of course you're, uh, suggesting some kind of inappropriate relationship here?"
0,150,47,KINSEY,"Inappropriate, yes. That is exactly what he's suggesting. It's difficult to come away from these reports without the distinct impression that there is a lot more going on between Colonel O'Neill and Major Carter than simple friendship and respect. For example, there was an incident last year in which Colonel O'Neill went missing."
0,150,47,WOOLSEY,"Based on a report filed by one of the scientists on the mission in question, Major Carter's behavior was erratic at best."
0,150,49,LEE,"Major, this technology's unlike anything we've come across before."
0,150,49,CARTER,I know.
0,150,49,LEE,"We have no reference, no way to interface."
0,150,49,CARTER,"I'm working on it, Doctor. As you should be!"
0,150,49,LEE,Right.
0,150,49,CARTER,"Excuse me? Where's Colonel O'Neill? I don't see him, do you? Did you guys find him while I was gone? *I* say when we're done here!"
0,150,50,MAYNARD,That's it? That's your evidence?
0,150,50,KINSEY,"Oh I believe there's a lot more to this than we've been told. Well, of course I hardly expect them to incriminate themselves in their own reports. But we can all read between the lines."
0,150,50,HAYES,"Alright, I've heard enough. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you, Mr. Woolsey."
0,150,50,WOOLSEY,Mr. President.
0,150,51,SARA,"Mr. Woolsey is here to see you, sir."
0,150,51,KINSEY,Send him in. Would you like a drink?
0,150,51,WOOLSEY,No thank you.
0,150,51,KINSEY,"That was nice work today, Richard."
0,150,51,WOOLSEY,Really? I got the distinct feeling it didn't go so well.
0,150,51,KINSEY,Ah well. It doesn't matter.
0,150,51,WOOLSEY,It doesn't?
0,150,51,KINSEY,Nah. The President's gonna come around.
0,150,51,WOOLSEY,"I didn't get that impression, Mr. Vice President. In fact I clearly sensed that he was siding with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs."
0,150,51,KINSEY,"Today was a formality. Don't get me wrong, the job you did was vital. The President has to appear to be hearing both sides, considering his position. He'll see things my way eventually."
0,150,51,WOOLSEY,And if he doesn't?
0,150,52,KINSEY,Things happen.
0,150,53,WOOLSEY,What is that supposed to mean?
0,150,53,KINSEY,"It means you chose the right side, Richard. One way or another, I promise you, I'm gonna win this one."
0,150,55,MAYNARD,Mr. President.
0,150,55,HAYES,General. I take it you're here to make a case for the defense.
0,150,55,MAYNARD,I'm not gonna get into a point/counterpoint.
0,150,55,HAYES,"Look, it may very well be that Hammond and SG-1 have done their very best under difficult circumstances, but there's a political aspect to the Vice President's position that makes a lot of sense."
0,150,55,MAYNARD,Sir?
0,150,55,HAYES,"A lot of people know about the Stargate. We can't keep it a secret forever. When it finally comes out, we're gonna be in the fight of our lives. We'll need the public's confidence."
0,150,55,MAYNARD,And you think cleaning house at the SGC now shows you're in control.
0,150,55,HAYES,You disagree?
0,150,55,MAYNARD,"I think there's time for that still, sir, but for the immediate future, I'm here to let you know what you're up against. And why we need Hammond and SG-1 right now, more than ever."
0,150,55,HAYES,Have a seat and fire away.
0,150,56,MAYNARD,"The System Lords have proven themselves to be formidable adversaries, and yet despite our obvious disadvantage we've managed to hold our own, Maybe even take them down a notch or two. We've been good and we've been lucky. But I'm afraid that could change. There's a new Goa'uld in the mix."
0,150,56,HAYES,I take it you're referring to the one who calls himself Anubis.
0,150,56,MAYNARD,"He's more powerful than any of his predecessors. He came to our attention a little over a year ago when he tried to take out Earth with an asteroid, and then used our own Stargate as a weapon against us. We thwarted him both times. Since then he's redirected his attention to his rivals, waging a year long war against the Goa'uld."
0,150,58,YOUR TIME IS UP!,
0,150,60,HAYES,"Well, that's good for us. Let 'em fight amongst themselves."
0,150,60,MAYNARD,"The problem is ... when he's through with them, and it's only a matter of time, he'll come gunning for us, and when he does, we'll be facing a whole new threat."
0,150,62,O'NEILL,Fire in the hole!
0,150,64,HAYES,A super-soldier.
0,150,64,MAYNARD,Not just one. He's got a whole army.
0,150,66,SUPER-SOLDIERS,Hail Anubis! Hail Anubis!
0,150,67,HAYES,"If that's true, I can't imagine how having Stargate-1 on the front line's gonna make one damn bit of difference when the time comes."
0,150,67,MAYNARD,"Anubis may be incredibly powerful, but he's not invincible. There is a way to take him out."
0,150,67,HAYES,How's that?
0,150,67,MAYNARD,By finding the lost city.
0,150,67,HAYES,"You'll have to forgive me, Francis. I'm not up to speed, I've only gone through about a third of those files."
0,150,67,MAYNARD,"The Gate system was built by a highly advanced race of aliens known as the Ancients. They died off millions of years ago, but it seems they haven't disappeared completely."
0,150,70,MAYNARD,They've evolved into higher life forms.
0,150,70,HAYES,"Well, will they help us?"
0,150,70,MAYNARD,"No, sir."
0,150,70,HAYES,Why the hell not?
0,150,70,MAYNARD,It's beneath them. They won't involve themselves in our affairs.
0,150,70,HAYES,So where are you going with this?
0,150,70,MAYNARD,Last year SG-1 made an amazing discovery on a planet called Abydos.
0,150,71,DANIEL,You're gonna find the lost city of the Ancients.
0,150,71,O'NEILL,Lost city?
0,150,71,DANIEL,"Didn't tell him about that either, huh?"
0,150,71,CARTER,Daniel found a tablet talking about a lost city.
0,150,71,DANIEL,Where there are powerful Ancient weapons capable of giving you a big advantage over Anubis.
0,150,71,O'NEILL,Do you know where it is?
0,150,71,DANIEL,"No, but I'll help you find it."
0,150,72,MAYNARD,"Hammond and SG-1 are close to finding the lost city. Let them do their job, sir. Let them save this planet one more time."
0,150,72,HAYES,I wish it were that simple.
0,150,72,MAYNARD,"I'm not sure what you mean, sir."
0,150,72,HAYES,"The Vice President may be a pain in the ass, but I can't just ignore him."
0,150,72,MAYNARD,You're the Commander in Chief. It's your decision.
0,150,72,HAYES,"True, but if I cross him on this one... well let's just say that I haven't viewed all the angles yet. Is there anything you haven't told me?"
0,150,72,MAYNARD,"No, sir."
0,150,72,HAYES,"Then as far as I can tell, Hammond and SG-1 have done an extraordinary job under very difficult circumstances. But in doing so they've made some mistakes, they've made some enemies, and frankly I don't know if I can protect them."
0,150,73,WOOLSEY,General.
0,150,73,MAYNARD,Mr. Woolsey.
0,150,73,WOOLSEY,Thank you for meeting me.
0,150,73,MAYNARD,I take it the Vice President doesn't know about this.
0,150,73,WOOLSEY,"No, and I'd like to keep it that way."
0,150,73,MAYNARD,What do you want?
0,150,73,WOOLSEY,"I want to warn you. I think the Vice President may be involved with people capable of... well, anything. I believe they may have attempted assassination at least once before as a means to get what they wanted."
0,150,73,MAYNARD,Do you realize the seriousness of what you just said?
0,150,73,WOOLSEY,"Yes, sir. Look, no matter what you might think of me, I consider myself to be a man of integrity. I took the job with the NID because I strongly believe in civilian oversight of top secret military operations."
0,150,73,MAYNARD,Mr. Woolsey...
0,150,73,WOOLSEY,"I don't have any proof, sir, but I'm starting to question whether those to whom I have dedicated my allegiance are as honorable as I had hoped."
0,150,73,MAYNARD,"You're a resourceful man, Mr. Woolsey. If you think there's proof out there, find it."
0,150,74,HAMMOND,Hammond. ... Show him in.
0,150,75,WOOLSEY,General.
0,150,75,HAMMOND,This must be important for you to have come all this way.
0,150,75,WOOLSEY,"I know you have no reason to trust me, General. That's why I felt I had to come here in person."
0,150,75,HAMMOND,Sit down.
0,150,75,WOOLSEY,"I take great pride in my work, General. My job demands meticulous research and, above all else, impartiality in its execution. My aim is to present an airtight argument, a point of view for consideration by those I serve, with no personal agenda whatsoever."
0,150,75,HAMMOND,Get to the point.
0,150,75,WOOLSEY,"I stand by my case against you and your personnel, despite what I'm about to say to you."
0,150,75,HAMMOND,I hope you don't expect that to gain my respect.
0,150,75,WOOLSEY,You recall the assassination attempt on then Senator Kinsey?
0,150,77,SECRET SERVICE MAN,The Senator's been hit! He's been hit!
0,150,78,WOOLSEY,And later gained notoriety for bringing those responsible to justice.
0,150,78,HAMMOND,I can only assume you're going somewhere with this.
0,150,78,WOOLSEY,Let's just say I've recently come to believe that those behind the rogue element of the NID have not entirely been eliminated. In fact they may be stronger then ever and Vice President Kinsey may still be tied to them.
0,150,78,HAMMOND,They tried to have him killed and then he tried to take them down. That seems unlikely.
0,150,78,WOOLSEY,"At the time, something must have made Kinsey a liability. But after the assassination attempt failed, the opportunity presented itself to propel Kinsey onto the presidential ticket. That could have been enough to motivate reconciliation."
0,150,78,HAMMOND,"Either way, I'm not surprised by any of this, Mr. Woolsey."
0,150,78,WOOLSEY,"Well I'm sorry to say that I am, and I want to do something about it if I can."
0,150,78,HAMMOND,Like what?
0,150,78,WOOLSEY,"Like present evidence, if there is any, connecting Kinsey to illegal activities involving those behind the rogue NID."
0,150,78,HAMMOND,What makes you think evidence like that exists?
0,150,78,WOOLSEY,Because you're sitting right there.
0,150,78,HAMMOND,I'm sorry?
0,150,78,WOOLSEY,"Three years ago you left SGC, supposedly retired. I'm guessing you were blackmailed."
0,150,78,HAMMOND,And?
0,150,78,WOOLSEY,"And then you came back. Nothing about that ever made any sense to me. I want to know why, how. You've got something on Kinsey, something I can use."
0,150,79,MAYBOURNE,"That's it, we're in. I'm downloading now. Kinsey's online activities connect him to NID actions over the last year and a half, including the secret operation I ran out of Area 51, the involvement with the Russians and the threats to Hammond."
0,150,79,O'NEILL,"You're a piece of work, Kinsey. You try to shut down the SGC, you make this big speech about how much you hate secret organizations and then you jump in bed with the NID. What is that?"
0,150,79,MAYBOURNE,I'm done.
0,150,79,KINSEY,What are you going to do? Take down the whole NID?
0,150,79,O'NEILL,No. Here's the deal. Get them to reinstate Hammond or this disc goes to the press.
0,150,80,WOOLSEY,"You've got connections, General. You must know what's going down."
0,150,81,HAMMOND,That's not the only copy.
0,150,82,WOOLSEY,Why haven't you given this to someone before now?
0,150,82,HAMMOND,I didn't know who to trust. I still don't.
0,150,84,AIDE,"Yes, sir, right away. The President will see you now."
0,150,84,WOOLSEY,Thank you.
0,150,85,WOOLSEY,"Thank you for seeing me, Mr. President."
0,150,85,HAYES,"Is there something that you wanted to add to your report, Mr. Woolsey?"
0,150,85,WOOLSEY,"Yes, sir. As I'm sure you're aware, the NID does not exactly have a spotless record. For several years, a group of rogue agents operated inside of its ranks. They were acting on behalf of a cabal of international business interests intent on acquiring alien technology for their own profit."
0,150,85,HAYES,One could only hope.
0,150,85,WOOLSEY,Mr. President?
0,150,85,HAYES,"I know they're out there, Mr. Woolsey. What I'm saying is, one could only hope that money was their chief motivation. However, I doubt the type of person who's behind this is short-sighted enough for that given what he must know. In light of the new reality that Stargate presents, there are aspirations beyond mere financial greed. That could be much worse."
0,150,85,WOOLSEY,I agree.
0,150,85,HAYES,You're here to tell me that the Vice President is still in league with them?
0,150,85,WOOLSEY,"If these people are as powerful as we both think, it does make one wonder what the Vice President could have possibly offered them in exchange for the price on his head."
0,150,85,HAYES,Obviously the full control of the Stargate program that the White House affords.
0,150,85,WOOLSEY,The Vice President brought key financing to your campaign victory. I just hope it didn't come at too high a cost. I also hope history one day shows that I tried to do the right thing.
0,150,85,HAYES,"Whose version of history, Mr. Woolsey?"
