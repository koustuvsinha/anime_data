0,151,0,"""THE LOST CITY I""",By Brad Wright & Robert C. Cooper
0,151,1,JACK,Ow! What?!
0,151,1,DANIEL,Jack! I've been translating the ancient writing in the collinade SG-2 discovered on P3X-439
0,151,1,JACK,"Daniel, I'll be there in half an hour..."
0,151,1,DANIEL,It talks about a library of knowledge Jack. I think the monument contains a repository of the Ancients.
0,151,1,JACK,Repository you say.
0,151,1,DANIEL,"Yeah. That thing that grabbed your head, made you talk crazy, nearly killed you."
0,151,1,JACK,It sounds like we should stay away then.
0,151,1,DANIEL,"Well, considering what we know now, we should be able to find another way to access the information. I mean, Sam's been able to use Tokra crystals to find a way to transfer all kinds of different energy. (Jack hears him babbling along, and looks at the phone. He sees the shaving cream, and puts the phone in the water to wipe the cream off of it. Daniel is heard, still talking, but breaking up as he dips the phone in the water. Then he RINSES the phone. We should go there as soon as possible."
0,151,1,JACK,Yeah?
0,151,1,DANIEL,So?
0,151,1,JACK,I'll be there in half an hour.
0,151,1,DANIEL,"Ok, bye ..."
0,151,1,JACK,"No, no, no, wait. Don't hang up. I need a seven-letter word."
0,151,1,DANIEL,I told Sam I wouldn't help you.
0,151,1,JACK,"Well, then this will be the one thing she doesn't know. Up, down, charmed, blank."
0,151,1,DANIEL,Strange.
0,151,1,JACK,Yeah. Well thanks anyway.
0,151,1,DANIEL,No the word you're looking for...
0,151,1,SCENE,"Washington, DC"
0,151,1,WEIR,"is walking down a street talking thru a headset.) I know, I know. I couldn't get her off the phone. It should be done by noon. Whatever it is, believe me, I'm sure it won't take long to say no, and then I'll be at Georgetown at two for my poli-sci class and I'm speaking at the woman's ..."
0,151,1,MAN,Taxi! TAXI!
0,151,1,WEIR,"In Washington ... dinner at seven. I'm sorry Michelle, I gotta call you back. This guy's trying to steal my cab. I'm sorry this is my cab. I called for a taxi ten minutes ago."
0,151,1,MAN,As do I.
0,151,1,WEIR,"I cannot be late. I'm going to the Whitehouse. I have to be there in fifteen minutes, I'm meeting the President.... of the United States. I ... Really I am."
0,151,1,TAXI DRIVER,Hey. Is one of you gonna get in or what?
0,151,1,WEIR,"Wait! Can I offer you cab fare. Wherever you need to go ... Please, can you call this man another taxi?"
0,151,1,LIMO DRIVER,Excuse me Doctor Weir. Please get in ma'am.
0,151,1,WEIR,Taxi ... ) is there in the seat) Mr. Vice President.
0,151,1,KINSEY,Doctor Weir.
0,151,2,WEIR,It wasn't necessary for you to pick me up sir.
0,151,2,KINSEY,I was on my way from the athletic club. Besides there are very few people who could properly brief you for this interview.
0,151,2,WEIR,Interview? I agreed to have just a meeting with....
0,151,2,KINSEY,"How would you respond if I told you the Air Force is currently conducting top-secret operations with an alien transportation device called the Stargate. It was discovered in the early 1900's at Giza, not too far from the Great Pyramids."
0,151,2,WEIR,Is this a joke? What is it?
0,151,2,KINSEY,A note from the President. and signed by President Hayes.) You might wanna read this too.
0,151,2,WEIR,Oh my God.
0,151,2,SCENE,Cheyenne Mountain Complex.
0,151,3,JACK,How long have you been waiting there?
0,151,3,DANIEL,"You said half an hour, an hour ago."
0,151,3,SAM,General Hammond's waiting.
0,151,3,JACK,Excuse me.
0,151,3,SAM,The fate of the world is hanging in the balance and you've been sitting in your truck finishing this?
0,151,3,JACK,I believe it was double or nothing.
0,151,3,SAM,"Ok. 23 across, the atomic weight of boron. Answer is ten."
0,151,3,JACK,Yes?
0,151,3,SAM,You wrote the word fat.
0,151,3,JACK,And your point?
0,151,3,REYNOLDS,They should be getting here ...
0,151,3,HARPER,Yeah!
0,151,3,JACK,"Harper, Reynolds."
0,151,3,HARPER,Sir!
0,151,3,REYNOLDS,Jack ...
0,151,3,SAM,
0,151,3,JACK,What mission?
0,151,3,HAMMOND,Good morning SG1. Nice of you to join us.
0,151,3,JACK,Good morning sir.
0,151,3,HAMMOND,"I've heard Doctor Jackson's report on his translation. Given what happened the last time you encountered something like this, I'm surprised you're so willing to take on this mission."
0,151,3,JACK,"So am I, sir."
0,151,3,DANIEL,Jack?
0,151,3,JACK,Daniel?
0,151,3,DANIEL,"Why wouldn't we wanna gain access to the greatest repository of knowledge in the known universe. Once and for all finding the Lost City of the Ancients, and use their advanced technology to save the entire galaxy from the evil oppression of the Goa'uld?"
0,151,3,JACK,"Well, there's that."
0,151,3,REYNOLDS,"From the mission file I've read, this is one of those things that whips out from the wall, grabs your head and re-arranges your brain right?"
0,151,3,DANIEL,Sort of.
0,151,3,REYNOLDS,Sort of?
0,151,3,SAM,"It basically downloads the entire library of Ancients knowledge into a persons mind. That massive amount of data then slowly unspools into your brain, eventually taking over your consciousness completely."
0,151,3,DANIEL,Except for it wasn't meant for a physiology as primitive as ours.
0,151,3,JACK,Easy fella ...
0,151,3,DANIEL,Sorry.
0,151,3,HARPER,I thought the report said you almost died last time sir.
0,151,3,TEAL'C,The asgard were able to remove the information from ONeills mind before he was lost to us.
0,151,3,JACK,"So why don't we just shoot Thor a call, get him standing by as back up."
0,151,3,SAM,We tried sir. He's not responding.
0,151,3,HAMMOND,None of our alien allies have been particularly reliable of late. If something happened again....
0,151,3,DANIEL,"General, no one's saying that anyone should directly interface with the device. We're suggesting that it be extracted and brought home for study."
0,151,3,HAMMOND,The engineering team that studied the last one of these devices you found determined nothing after six months of research.
0,151,3,SAM,"We believe that, that device's power source was depleted when Colonel O'Neill activated it."
0,151,3,HAMMOND,"Recent intel suggests that Anubis has become a serious threat to dominate the rest of the Goa'uld in a very short time. We have to consider that Earth is at risk now more than ever. If the knowledge contained within this device can lead us to technologies we can use to defend ourselves, we must pursue it."
0,151,3,JACK,Why didn't you just say that?
0,151,3,DANIEL,Sorry.
0,151,3,HAMMOND,You have a go. And be careful people.
0,151,4,KINSEY,The file you read in the car is just the beginning. You might want to familiarize yourself with some more of this before you take the job.
0,151,4,WEIR,"Take the job? I only just found out that science fiction isn't fiction. I mean I've known there were secrets, big secrets, but this is. I don't know what is scarier, the fact that this is all true or the fact that you're telling me. I can't imagine what kind of job you're offering me sir, but at this point I really don't care anymore."
0,151,4,KINSEY,I realize you haven't met the President yet. Just try and say no.
0,151,4,SGC GATEROOM,
0,151,4,DAVIS,Chevron seven locked.
0,151,4,HAMMOND,
0,151,4,JACK,"Thank you sir. Let's move out! Reynold's, set up defense perimeters as you see fit. Hold the gate till we get back."
0,151,4,REYNOLDS,"You got it, Sir ..."
0,151,4,JACK,
0,151,4,DANIEL,I know.
0,151,4,JACK,We could have Goa'uld on our collective asses any minute now.
0,151,4,DANIEL,"I know....According to the text on this column, it's inside."
0,151,4,JACK,Inside you say. Well let me tell you my friend. There is no inside. There's just a whole lot of outside.
0,151,4,DANIEL,I know.
0,151,4,SAM,I'm getting some strange readings coming from here.
0,151,4,DANIEL,If I'm right ...
0,151,4,JACK,Look out. Reynolds come in.
0,151,4,REYNOLDS,Go ahead.
0,151,4,JACK,"Yeah, we got something here, stand by."
0,151,4,REYNOLDS,All clear for the moment.
0,151,5,SAM,We just have to figure out how to get this thing out of the wall. Careful!
0,151,5,JACK,All right one more time. Why are we doing this? Why?
0,151,5,REYNOLDS,You hear something Harper?
0,151,5,HARPER,Sir! We got multiple bogeys coming in fast.
0,151,5,REYNOLDS,Dial the Gate!
0,151,5,AIRMAN,Here we go!
0,151,5,REYNOLDS,"Send a constant radio signal, we have to keep that door open. SG1 we have incoming."
0,151,5,JACK,All right let's go.
0,151,5,DANIEL,Jack we can't just leave.
0,151,5,JACK,Daniel.
0,151,5,TEAL'C,We must not allow this device to fall into the hands of Anubis.
0,151,5,JACK,Fine.
0,151,5,JACK!,
0,151,5,SAM,"Sir he's right, if we destroy it we lose our only chance to find the location of the Lost City."
0,151,5,TEAL'C,O'Neill.
0,151,5,JACK,"Ah crap! All right then, what? No, no, no, no, no!"
0,151,5,DANIEL,Jack somebody has to do it. The answer is in there! If we don't find the Lost City we're as good as dead. Let me do it.
0,151,5,JACK,"And who does the translating, when you go Ancient? In fact you're the one person who CAN do it."
0,151,5,DANIEL,Jack!!!
0,151,5,SAM,Sir!
0,151,6,TEAL'C,O'Neill
0,151,6,REYNOLDS,
0,151,6,SAM,Colonel Reynolds we are heading back to the gate.
0,151,6,REYNOLDS,Hold positions. Reece you're with me!!
0,151,6,DANIEL,"Take cover! Jack, Jack, you ok?"
0,151,6,JACK,What's going on?
0,151,6,DANIEL,"Come on, let's get him up."
0,151,6,AIRMAN,"Go, go GO!"
0,151,6,REYNOLDS,"General Hammond, we're coming through the gate. We're right behind you sir. Go. Go!"
0,151,6,HAMMOND,What happened?
0,151,6,JACK,Didn't quite go according to plan Sir.
0,151,6,DANIEL,We have to get him to the infirmary.
0,151,6,JACK,I did it again.
0,151,7,HAYES,Doctor Weir. I'm sorry to have kept you so late.
0,151,7,WEIR,"Well that's all right, I've been doing a little reading. Mr. President....I mean, this is truly so outrageous. I feel compelled on behalf of everyone who has no idea, that, that..."
0,151,7,HAYES,Megan. Could you get a car ready for Doctor Weir? Five minutes. Thanks. Sit down. Would you like something?
0,151,7,WEIR,"No, thank you."
0,151,7,HAYES,Your reaction was very similar to mine when I found out.
0,151,7,WEIR,I'm sorry. Five minutes sir?
0,151,7,HAYES,The negotiation you mediated in North Africa?
0,151,7,WEIR,Yes? What does that have to do with this?
0,151,7,HAYES,"Well just that, the Stargate, probably makes that seem like childs play."
0,151,7,WEIR,Well frankly sir I have absolutely no idea what you want from me.
0,151,7,HAYES,You brokered a dozen of the most sensitive international treaties in modern times. You speak God knows how many languages.
0,151,7,WEIR,Just ... five.
0,151,7,HAYES,Five. I suppose your aversion to the military will be an issue.
0,151,7,WEIR,"What are we talking about, exactly?"
0,151,7,HAYES,You running the Stargate Program.
0,151,7,WEIR,Oh ...
0,151,7,HAYES,How the hell did this happen?
0,151,7,DANIEL,He did it deliberately sir.
0,151,7,TEAL'C,In order to access the knowledge of the Ancients.
0,151,7,DANIEL,"He, we, figured we'd never get another shot at it."
0,151,7,SAM,We know from experience that the Ancients knowledge will essentially overwrite the Colonel's brain. We're hoping that during the transformation process he'll become aware of the information we're looking for.
0,151,7,HAMMOND,And then?
0,151,7,SAM,"And then it will overwhelm his nervous system, and the Colonel will...."
0,151,7,JACK,What? Meet my maker? Pay the piper? Reach the pearly gates? Start pushing up daisies here and there?
0,151,7,HAMMOND,You should be in the infirmary.
0,151,7,JACK,"Why? We all know exactly what's gonna happen. In a few days I start speaking some strange language. A few days after that I start doing things beyond my control, and a few days after that, it's goodnight my someone, goodnight. So with your permission sir I'd like to take the weekend to get some personal things together."
0,151,7,SAM,"The last time, it did take a couple of days before we noticed any change in the Colonels behavior."
0,151,7,JACK,I'll be back. Ready to work.
0,151,7,HAMMOND,Permission granted.
0,151,7,JACK,"Thank you sir. Now if you'll excuse me, my favorite television show starts in half an hour."
0,151,7,HAYES,"We've already done an initial review and we've decided to suspend current operations until a new government division can be established. There's no question the Stargate is a dangerous thing, but from what we know is going on out there. It's something we can't ignore."
0,151,7,WEIR,No obviously not. I don't want this to sound like a terribly self-centered question.
0,151,7,HAYES,Why you?
0,151,7,WEIR,Why me?
0,151,7,HAYES,What do you think?
0,151,7,WEIR,"Well, I'm betting other world leaders are pressuring you for control."
0,151,7,HAYES,"See, I knew you were a quick study."
0,151,7,WEIR,"And I can advise you there, but I am not qualified to negotiate with aliens."
0,151,7,HAYES,"Well, no one is Doctor. Not you, not me. But someone has to do it. The fact is, we can't keep this thing a secret forever."
0,151,7,WEIR,And you wanna put a friendly face on this thing when it goes public. Someone a little less threatening than a US Military General.
0,151,7,HAYES,People will panic. It's going to take anything and everything we have to keep our civilization from turning upside down. But make no mistake. You're not just a figurehead for the publicity. I chose you for a damn good reason.
0,151,7,WEIR,I take it my five minutes are up.
0,151,7,HAYES,Actually it was seven. Don't worry. This is just the beginning.
0,151,7,WEIR,What if I say no sir?
0,151,7,HAYES,Never going to happen. Bonnie! Come on in here. Thank you. Good seeing you again.
0,151,7,KINSEY,So! Things aren't quite as simple as they seem.
0,151,7,WEIR,They've never seemed simple sir.
0,151,7,KINSEY,Be careful who you trust Doctor.
0,151,7,WEIR,Does that include you sir?
0,151,7,KINSEY,He may be the President. But I am the one person on this fair planet you want on your side and the one person you don't want to cross.
0,151,9,SAM,Hi Sir.
0,151,9,JACK,Carter?
0,151,9,SAM,Did I wake you?
0,151,9,JACK,Sorta
0,151,9,SAM,I couldn't sleep at all last night.
0,151,9,JACK,You should have called.
0,151,9,SAM,I didn't wanna bother you.
0,151,9,JACK,"Um, I was just looking at the sky. Trying to figure out how many stars we'd actually been to."
0,151,9,SAM,"Actually, only a few of the stars visible from Earth have Stargates on them, so....."
0,151,9,JACK,I knew that.
0,151,9,SAM,Yeah.
0,151,9,JACK,Hammond send you by to check up on me?
0,151,9,SAM,"No! It's funny really, I was out driving, you know....in my car, and I um, I drove here. Yeah ..."
0,151,9,JACK,"""Funny."""
0,151,9,SAM,Yeah.
0,151,9,JACK,There's coffee around here.
0,151,9,JACK,Maybe not. How about a beer?
0,151,9,SAM,"Sure, why not."
0,151,9,JACK,Want a glass? I can wash one.
0,151,9,SAM,"No, I'm fine. Thank you sir. So do you ever talk to her?"
0,151,9,JACK,Can we not talk about that?
0,151,9,SAM,Sorry. ) How are you feeling?
0,151,9,JACK,Can we not talk about that either?
0,151,9,SAM,Ok. What do you want to talk about? You wanna be alone. This was a bad I ... I ... should go.
0,151,9,JACK,Finish your beer. ) And then you have to wait at least an hour before you drive.
0,151,9,SAM,Sir?
0,151,9,JACK,What?
0,151,9,SAM,I should have done it.
0,151,9,JACK,What? Stuck your head in that thing? Are you nuts? Carter. You're one of this country's natural resources. If not National treasures. It couldn't have gone down any other way. I just hope it's worth it.
0,151,9,SAM,Even if we do find the Lost City. Even if we get there and find exactly what we're looking for to defend the planet....
0,151,9,JACK,
0,151,9,DANIEL,"Opening the door, putting his head in) Hello!?"
0,151,9,JACK,In here.
0,151,9,DANIEL,"Oh sorry, are we interrupting anything?"
0,151,9,JACK AND SAM,No...
0,151,9,JACK,What are you doing here?
0,151,9,DANIEL,"Oh we ... well it's ... it's a funny story actually. We, we, ah, were driving by and we, uh ... saw Sam's car in the driveway, and ... and ... uh ..."
0,151,9,JACK,Funny.
0,151,9,DANIEL,"... Teal'c said to me. Well he didn't actually say anything. He just kinda looked at me and did that eyebrow raise thing that he kinda does and I said to him, I said 'hey, why don't we stop by and'..."
0,151,9,JACK,Is that doughnuts?
0,151,9,TEAL'C,Indeed!
0,151,9,JACK,Excellent.
0,151,9,ANUBIS,Rise!
0,151,9,FIRST PRIME,My Lord. I believe the humans of the Tauri destroyed the device you sought.
0,151,9,ANUBIS,You failed to stop them.
0,151,9,FIRST PRIME,They anticipated our arrival my Lord.
0,151,9,JACK,you are so wrong. It's a perfect analogy. Burns as Goa'uld.
0,151,9,TEAL'C,They are merely animated characters O'Neill.
0,151,9,JACK,You are so shallow.
0,151,9,DANIEL,Oh Please! Talcs like one of the deepest people I know. He's so deep. Come on! Tell em how deep you are. You'll be lucky if you understand this.
0,151,9,TEAL'C,My depth is immaterial to this conversation.
0,151,9,DANIEL,Oh!! See?
0,151,9,JACK,No more beer for you.
0,151,9,SAM,"I'm sorry sir, but I have to agree. I don't see the connection."
0,151,9,JACK,All right that does it. You know the entire VHS collection was going to one of you. It's going to Siler. He gets it. Thank God. Pizza. Well you're not the usual delivery boy.
0,151,9,HAMMMOND,Is this a good time?
0,151,9,JACK,It's always a good time for you sir. Come on in. Let me get you a chair.
0,151,9,SAM,General.
0,151,9,HAMMOND,"At ease Major, please."
0,151,9,JACK,There you go sir.
0,151,9,HAMMOND,I'm glad to find you all here. You wouldn't happen to have another one of those?
0,151,9,JACK,I would. I hope you like Guiness Sir. I find it a refreshing substitute for....food.
0,151,9,HAMMOND,Ive been relieved of command.
0,151,9,JACK,What?
0,151,9,HAMMOND,The President has effectively shut down the SGC for a three-month review process.
0,151,9,DANIEL,Three months?
0,151,9,HAMMOND,"During which time, a newly formed Government department will take the place of Stargate Command."
0,151,9,SAM,"But Sir, the Colonel. We don't have much time."
0,151,9,TEAL'C,How could this happen?
0,151,9,DANIEL,Kinsey.
0,151,9,JACK,Does anyone know anyone who voted for those two shrubs?
0,151,9,HAMMOND,"I've known President Hayes for a long time. He's a good man. Despite his tastes in running mates, maybe. Robert Kinsey brought in a lot of campaign financing. For all we know, he may have used his knowledge of the Stargate as leverage to get himself a place on the ticket. It doesn't matter now."
0,151,9,DANIEL,"What, we're just going to lie down for this?"
0,151,9,JACK,Weve been in this situation before.
0,151,9,HAMMOND,"No, this time it's different."
0,151,9,SAM,Who's replacing you Sir?
0,151,9,HAMMOND,Her name is Doctor Elizabeth Weir.
0,151,9,JACK,A civilian?
0,151,9,DANIEL,I've heard of her. She's an expert in international politics. She mediates some high level negotiations for the UN. I actually referenced some of her work when I drafted the first treaty for the Tokra.
0,151,9,HAMMOND,All I know is I've been ordered to Washington to discuss reassignment. I leave tomorrow.
0,151,9,JACK,"General, we do have a little unfinished business here."
0,151,9,HAMMOND,"As far as I know, you're all to report for work as scheduled on Monday."
0,151,9,TEAL'C,Something must be done.
0,151,9,HAMMOND,"I have my orders. Besides, I have a feeling I may be able to do more about this from Washington than I can here."
0,151,9,SAM,And in the meantime?
0,151,9,HAMMOND,Youll just have to plead your case to the new administration. I have every confidence in you people.
0,151,10,DANIEL,Amazing isn't it?
0,151,10,WEIR,I don't really care.
0,151,10,DANIEL,Ok
0,151,10,WEIR,"What? ... Well there's gonna be a lot of changes and not everybody's going to be happy about them. Yes, I'm about to step into one myself. Ok bye. Sorry. I walk around with this thing, I look like a crazy person, talking to myself. Elizabeth Weir."
0,151,10,DANIEL,Daniel Jackson.
0,151,10,WEIR,I can't get used to being this far underground. I keep looking around for a window.
0,151,10,DANIEL,"I see you found the one with the best view. I remember when we were first trying to get the Stargate to work, I would come here and just stare at it for hours."
0,151,10,WEIR,Is that a gentle reminder that you've been an important part of this since the very beginning?
0,151,10,DANIEL,Subtle huh?
0,151,10,WEIR,Mmn-Hmn ...
0,151,10,DANIEL,"So, a little bit of light reading."
0,151,10,WEIR,Ah. I've been awake all weekend. The reality of this is....It's an adrenaline rush.
0,151,10,DANIEL,Hey. At least I know you have a beating heart.
0,151,10,WEIR,I don't expect the warmest welcome from the Military personnel.
0,151,10,DANIEL,Youre replacing a great man. Uniform not withstanding.
0,151,10,WEIR,"Okay. but I'm hoping you of all people, won't jump to conclusions."
0,151,10,DANIEL,Like why someone like you is here?
0,151,10,WEIR,Someone like me?
0,151,10,DANIEL,"Yeah, someone who started their career as a political activist. Lobbying against the government spending on the military."
0,151,10,WEIR,"And how I end up working for those I was criticizing? I know, but I've decided that the best way to stop the proliferation of weapons is to try and end the need for them. So I'm going to be the voice of reason to whoever will listen."
0,151,10,DANIEL,And you think that's why the President chose you to take over the SGC?
0,151,10,WEIR,"I don't know why I've been given this job. I really don't, but I'm going to do it to the best of my abilities as long as I'm here. I'm going to start by examining the mandate for this program..-"
0,151,10,DANIEL,Don't underestimate the immediate threat.
0,151,10,WEIR,"No I'm not, but this country's history of manifest destiny cannot continue out to the rest of the galaxy, especially when this is all being done behind the back of the entire planet."
0,151,10,DANIEL,"Hey I'm not saying that everything that has been going on around here is right, I mean we have no right to play God, but neither do the Goa'uld. Now I know none of this may seem real to you on paper, but trust me, they're pure evil. Now if they had the chance they would either destroy us or enslave us all. You can read as many mission reports as you want but before you decide what should or shouldn't be done around here, why don't you go through that gate and see what's going on for yourself."
0,151,10,WEIR,In good time.
0,151,10,DANIEL,We may not have good time and Jack O'Neill certainly doesn't.
0,151,10,WEIR,I want you to know that Colonel O'Neill's current condition is of serious concern to me.
0,151,10,DANIEL,"Then realize that Jack only did what he did, because it was our only way to find the location of the Lost City."
0,151,10,WALTER,Unscheduled incoming traveler.
0,151,10,WEIR,All the off world teams are back already.
0,151,10,COLONEL PIERCE,"Dr Weir, we are receiving Master Bra'tac's personal identification code."
0,151,10,WEIR,"I know what an IDC is, thank you Colonel Pierce."
0,151,10,DANIEL,Well he's an ally and if we don't open the iris..-
0,151,10,WEIR,"I understand, thank you. Go ahead please."
0,151,10,DANIEL,"Bra'tac. This is Dr Elizabeth Weir, she's the new leader of this facility."
0,151,10,WEIR,Hello.
0,151,10,BRA'TAC,Has Hammond of Texas fallen in battle?
0,151,10,WEIR,"No sir, he's fine."
0,151,10,DANIEL,We've had some recent changes in our political leaders.
0,151,10,BRA'TAC,I see.
0,151,10,DANIEL,"Bra'tac, what's wrong?"
0,151,10,BRA'TAC,I'm afraid I'm not the bearer of good news. We have had word from Jaffa loyal to our cause. Anubis is gathering full force of his fleet. He will be here within three days.
0,151,10,HAYES,"Bob, can we stop complaining and start figuring out what we're going to do?"
0,151,10,SECRETARY,Mr. President. General Hammond.
0,151,10,HAYES,"Show him in. We can't ignore a threat of this magnitude, hear the man out! Well whatever he is, and get back to me! )"
0,151,10,HAYES,General George Hammond.
0,151,10,HAMMOND,Mr. President.
0,151,10,HAYES,I think it was Lieutenant last time we spoke wasn't it?
0,151,10,HAMMOND,"For both of us, that was a lot of hair ago sir."
0,151,10,HAYES,"Sit down. You know when I took this job, I thought I had the weight of the world on my shoulders. But then I found out what you do for a living."
0,151,10,HAMMOND,"Yes, Sir."
0,151,10,HAYES,"George this had nothing to do with your record, but if the American people had any idea what your contribution was..."
0,151,10,HAMMOND,"Thank you Sir, that's kind of you to say. One day maybe they will."
0,151,10,HAYES,"Dr Weir, she's as smart as they come."
0,151,10,HAMMOND,I hope so.
0,151,10,HAYES,"The poor thing, she has no idea what's she gotten herself into. I had no choice George, I had to do something. I want you to know that I'm aware of your history with the Vice President."
0,151,10,HAMMOND,Yes Sir.
0,151,10,HAYES,"Hell, We both know why I picked Kinsey, more then the money... he delivered Florida all by himself. Trust me, if I knew then..."
0,151,10,HAMMOND,Of course.
0,151,10,HAYES,"So, let's talk about your reassignment."
0,151,10,HAMMOND,I was thinking more along the lines of retirement Sir.
0,151,10,HAYES,"I don't think so George, not just yet. I want to keep you around Washington; we're going to need you and your expertise."
0,151,10,JACK,"Three days from now is a Thursday, Thursday's not good for us."
0,151,10,SAM,Why now?
0,151,10,TEAL'C,Anubis believes that we know the location of the Lost City.
0,151,10,SAM,We don't.
0,151,10,JACK,Not yet.
0,151,10,DANIEL,"Yes, but He doesn't know that we don't know ..."
0,151,10,KINSEY,"Oh! Well, some people just don't know when to leave."
0,151,10,WEIR,"Colonel O'Neill, Major Carter, Teal'c. I know these are strange circumstances to be meeting for the first time."
0,151,10,JACK,And you are...?
0,151,10,WEIR,"I am ... Dr Elizabeth Weir, Colonel."
0,151,10,KINSEY,You can just call her your one hope of ever stepping through the Stargate again.
0,151,10,JACK,Bit of a mouthful.
0,151,10,WEIR,"I know I'm playing catch-up, but I understand that time is short."
0,151,10,JACK,Actually it's all relative ma'am. Carter could explain it better if we had more time.
0,151,10,WEIR,Shall we have a seat then? Obviously this is a situation of great importance.
0,151,10,JACK,She's quick.
0,151,10,KINSEY,Which is why I've taken it upon myself to come down here and see what Mr. Bra'tac has to say personally.
0,151,10,JACK,
0,151,10,KINSEY,I beg your pardon. So you believe the Goa'uld Anubis is planning to attack?
0,151,10,BRA'TAC,You may be certain of it.
0,151,10,KINSEY,"I'll say this, the timing is impeccable. The moment we suspend Stargate operations, you pull this out of your hat."
0,151,10,JACK,"Mr. VICE President, if you're suggesting that we'd make something like this up"
0,151,10,KINSEY,"Yes Colonel, that's exactly what I'm suggesting."
0,151,10,JACK,"Yes well that is exactly what we do; we sit around on our fat asses and create scenarios that put the planet at risk, that's exactly what we do."
0,151,10,KINSEY,Oh I think you'd do just about anything...
0,151,10,WEIR,"Gentlemen. For the purposes of this discussion, let's assume that Master Bra'tac is in earnest and that the threat is real."
0,151,10,DANIEL,"Do you even know what the threat is? Anubis is a half Goa'uld, half ascended Ancient. With the knowledge and technology at his disposal to wipe us all from the face of the Earth."
0,151,10,WEIR,What about negotiating?
0,151,10,JACK,"Oh' for crying out loud, that's derantis. What?"
0,151,10,DANIEL,You just said derantis.
0,151,10,JACK,Did not.
0,151,10,DANIEL,Did to.
0,151,10,JACK,"Derantis, what is that?"
0,151,10,KINSEY,Latin?
0,151,10,WEIR,No it's not.
0,151,10,DANIEL,I think what Colonel O'Neill is trying to say is that trying to negotiate based on our past experiences would be insane... crazy.
0,151,10,WEIR,"Yeah, I got that."
0,151,10,SAM,However we believe that there may be alien technology within our reach that could defeat Anubis.
0,151,10,KINSEY,So now you're pulling a ray gun out of your hat.
0,151,10,TEAL'C,Weapons capable of defending this planet.
0,151,10,KINSEY,I can't believe we're sitting here listening to this.
0,151,10,WEIR,"Mr. Vice President, on his last mission..."
0,151,10,KINSEY,"Oh' I am aware of the events and that once again compromised Colonel O'Neill's invaluable judgment, and the fact that on his last official mission, he has incurred the wrath of humanity's worst enemy on behalf of us all."
0,151,10,JACK,"Wait a minute, I thought you didn't buy into the whole invasion thing."
0,151,10,WEIR,"The fact is, until we know the location of the Lost City..."
0,151,10,JACK,I know where it is.
0,151,10,WEIR,You know where it is now?
0,151,10,JACK,"I will, it's in there somewhere. Look, let me make this simple. If I come up with the Lost City, we go find it, yes or no?"
0,151,10,KINSEY,No!
0,151,10,JACK,"Who are you, really? And why are you here?"
0,151,10,WEIR,I will consider it.
0,151,10,JACK,Thank you.
0,151,10,WEIR,You're welcome.
0,151,10,BRA'TAC,I must return to Chulak.
0,151,10,TEAL'C,
0,151,10,WEIR,Good luck.
0,151,10,KINSEY,What the hell was that?
0,151,10,WEIR,I'm sorry?
0,151,10,KINSEY,You don't know O'Neill like I do.
0,151,10,WEIR,This is my call. Colonel O'Neill
0,151,10,KINSEY,Is the one who got us into this mess in the first place!
0,151,10,WEIR,I don't see...
0,151,10,KINSEY,"I want him gone, Doctor. I want them all gone, you haven't figured that out yet?"
0,151,10,WEIR,Oh' I figured out quite a bit.
0,151,10,KINSEY,Well hallelujah for that.
0,151,10,WEIR,"This is my office, this is my chair. Until someone tells me otherwise, I'm going to make decisions as I see fit. Not as they fit into your agenda."
0,151,10,KINSEY,You have no idea what my agenda is.
0,151,10,WEIR,Whatever your agenda is.
0,151,10,KINSEY,"You don't know anything Doctor, and if you think you do, you're not as smart as I thought."
0,151,10,JACK,"So T, if I don't see you again..."
0,151,10,TEAL'C,I will see you soon O'Neill.
0,151,10,JACK,You know something I don't?
0,151,10,TEAL'C,In fact it is you who knows something I do not.
0,151,10,JACK,I hope you're right.
0,151,10,TEAL'C,) I wish you all well.
