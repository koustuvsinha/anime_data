0,152,0,"""THE LOST CITY II""",By Robert C. Cooper & Brad Wright Transcribed by
0,152,1,DANIEL,Does this mean anything to you?
0,152,1,ONEILL,No.
0,152,1,DANIEL,Could you at least look at it?
0,152,1,ONEILL,"Daniel, I dont speak Ancient. Yet. And when I do eventually you know Ill never understand it."
0,152,1,DANIEL,You have to try.
0,152,1,ONEILL,"Look, last time things just popped into my fron."
0,152,1,DANIEL,Fron is head.
0,152,1,ONEILL,"Now, you see, I have no idea what youre talkin about."
0,152,1,DANIEL,"Well, maybe if you stopped working on this stupid ..."
0,152,1,ONEILL,"Hey, hey, hey! Id like to at least finish that while I can."
0,152,1,CARTER,I thought you were supposed to be ...
0,152,1,DANIEL,"Thirteen across, you wrote taonas."
0,152,1,ONEILL,Yeah? So? Whats it mean?
0,152,1,DANIEL,Well I dont know you tell me. Eight down you wrote proklarush.
0,152,1,CARTER,Whats eight down?
0,152,1,DANIEL,"Umm ... label. Theres empty spaces I think the answers supposed to be identification. Thirteen across is sphere ... Jack, this is it!"
0,152,1,ONEILL,"Now, see, I assume we still speak the same language ... mostly."
0,152,1,DANIEL,Sphere planet. Label name.
0,152,1,ONEILL,Following still you not!
0,152,1,DANIEL,Proklarush Taonas. I think you wrote the name of the planet where well find the lost city in the crossword.
0,152,1,ONEILL,... Bit of a jump.
0,152,1,DANIEL,"Well, why else would you do that?"
0,152,1,CARTER,The clue for seven down is celestial body and he wrote Uma Thurman.
0,152,1,ONEILL,Yes!
0,152,1,DANIEL,It has to mean something.
0,152,1,ONEILL,It does. Im hungry.
0,152,2,DANIEL,Proklarush Taonas. According to this it means lost in fire. It was lost. This has to be the planet where that lost city is.
0,152,2,CARTER,"Well, even if it is, knowing the name of the planet doesnt really help unless we have a Gate address to get us there."
0,152,2,DANIEL,"Jack, whatre you doing?"
0,152,2,ONEILL,At.
0,152,2,CARTER,What?
0,152,2,ONEILL,At.
0,152,2,DANIEL,This?
0,152,2,ONEILL,At. DANIEL:
0,152,3,ONEILL,You can stop ... that. And dont ask me what it means I dont know.
0,152,3,DANIEL,I think I do. . Whats this?
0,152,3,ONEILL,Shh. Well?
0,152,3,CARTER,You just told us to be quiet.
0,152,3,ONEILL,No when I look at this I think Shh.
0,152,3,DANIEL,Thats it.
0,152,3,CARTER,What?
0,152,3,DANIEL,Proklarush Taonas. Six syllables. What if each symbol on the Stargate has a corresponding sound so that it can be spoken aloud?
0,152,3,CARTER,Like an alphabet.
0,152,3,DANIEL,Proklarush Taonas isnt just the name of the planet. Its also the Gate address.
0,152,4,DANIEL,At is the Earth symbol our point of origin. Proklarush Taonas At.
0,152,4,WEIR,So this is the Gate address that could lead us to the lost city.
0,152,4,DANIEL,It has to be.
0,152,4,CARTER,Wait a minute. We dialled this same address over two years ago but we couldnt establish a wormhole. The Gate must be buried.
0,152,4,DANIEL,Lost in fire.
0,152,4,CARTER,"Well, what were looking for could still be there. I could use the address to calculate the planets location in space but well need a ship to get there."
0,152,4,DANIEL,Prometheus.
0,152,4,WEIR,"But with Anubis on his way, Prometheus is our last line of defence."
0,152,4,CARTER,Maybe Tealc has something by now.
0,152,4,WEIR,Wheres Colonel ONeill?
0,152,4,DANIEL,... Packing.
0,152,5,WEIR,Colonel.
0,152,5,ONEILL,Dont ask.
0,152,5,CARTER,The last time this happened he just started doing things without knowing why.
0,152,5,DANIEL,"Its a good sign, though hopefully it means were on the right track."
0,152,5,CARTER,Sir?
0,152,5,ONEILL,"I dont know, Carter! Grab a naqahdah generator, willya?"
0,152,6,RONAN,I am Ronan.
0,152,6,BRATAC,I knew your father.
0,152,6,RONAN,It is an honour. I have a ship at my disposal.
0,152,6,TEALC,So we have heard.
0,152,6,RONAN,"Forgive me, but as brave as you are, you cannot possibly hope to stop the fleet of Anubis with just one ship. I have seen the extent of his forces."
0,152,6,BRATAC,We only wish to use your ship to help us find something much more powerful.
0,152,6,TEALC,Something that we believe will defeat Anubis once and for all.
0,152,6,RONAN,"If that is true, then I will join you. That is my only condition. I am a fine pilot."
0,152,6,TEALC,So we have heard.
0,152,7,WEIR,"Well, have you got everything you need? I think theres still a sink in the kitchen."
0,152,7,ONEILL,Is that a joke?
0,152,7,WEIR,Perhaps. A bad one.
0,152,7,ONEILL,"Yes, very bad. But I sense hope for you."
0,152,7,WEIR,"Well, I hope for all of us that you find what youre looking for, Colonel."
0,152,7,ONEILL,Thank you.
0,152,8,ONEILL,What?
0,152,8,DANIEL,"I would have done it, you know."
0,152,8,ONEILL,I know.
0,152,8,DANIEL,"I mean, there has to be a way to reverse the effects, once we have what we need. Well find a way."
0,152,8,CARTER,"Were coaxing everything we can out of the engines, but were still two days away. Howre you feeling, sir?"
0,152,8,ONEILL,A bit cruvus. A little fron-ache. We need to go faster.
0,152,10,JUMPER,"Mr President, a short time ago, our space-based radar detected three Goauld vessels emerging from hyperspace."
0,152,10,HAYES,"Looks like you were wrong, Bob."
0,152,10,KINSEY,Three Goauld ships is hardly the full force of Anubis fleet.
0,152,10,HAMMOND,Sounds to me like Anubis wants to know if SG-1 was successful in procuring Ancient defence technology.
0,152,10,KINSEY,They werent.
0,152,10,HAMMOND,"Not yet, but Anubis doesnt know that."
0,152,10,HAYES,And hes most likely holding back his main invasion fleet til he finds out what weve got.
0,152,10,JUMPER,"Sir, Prometheus and our fleet of 302s can give em a run for their money."
0,152,10,HAMMOND,"If thats all he throws at us, yes, sir, I agree."
0,152,10,KINSEY,Lets do it!
0,152,10,HAMMOND,"However, Mr President, I agree with your assessment of the situation. Anubis objective is to goad us into a precipitous action which will show our hand. I believe launching the Prometheus now will only serve to demonstrate we lack the very advanced weaponry Anubis is afraid of."
0,152,10,HAYES,"Remain at DEFCON 3 for the time being but contact the governments of Russia, Great Britain, France, China and Canada and let em know what we think were in for. In the meantime, Id better prepare a hell of a speech. Thank you."
0,152,11,ONEILL,Give me your zat. There you go.
0,152,11,CARTER,Sir. I think you should know that General Hammond authorised me to take command of the team if I determined that you
0,152,11,ONEILL,Do it now.
0,152,11,CARTER,"Sir, I dont think thats necessary"
0,152,11,ONEILL,I trust you. Ill make it easy for you. I resign. Youre in charge.
0,152,11,CARTER,
0,152,11,ONEILL,I know.
0,152,12,HERAK,My Lord. The advance attack reports that they have received no challenge.
0,152,12,ANUBIS,"Order them to begin the attack. If the Tauri have weapons of the Ancients, we shall see."
0,152,13,CARTER,"Well, this doesnt look good. The surface is almost completely covered by lava flows."
0,152,13,DANIEL,How could there have ever been a civilisation down there?
0,152,13,CARTER,A star becomes a red giant like this near the end of its life. A million years ago this planet may have looked very much like Earth.
0,152,13,DANIEL,So were a million years late?!
0,152,13,CARTER,Probably more.
0,152,13,DANIEL,Thats very late.
0,152,13,ONEILL,What?
0,152,14,BRATAC,I have scanned the entire surface.
0,152,14,ONEILL,What do you want me to say? I dont even know why were here.
0,152,14,CARTER,But you did pack the Hazmat suits for us. My guess is you knew the condition of the planet and you knew that we would have to go down there.
0,152,14,ONEILL,Then you know more than I do.
0,152,14,CARTER,"No, sir, I dont. Sit down and take a look. Thats an order."
0,152,14,ONEILL,Easy. Taonas.
0,152,14,CARTER,Sir?
0,152,14,ONEILL,What?
0,152,14,DANIEL,You looked at the screen and said Taonas.
0,152,14,ONEILL,If you say so.
0,152,14,DANIEL,You say so.
0,152,14,CARTER,Theres a small anomaly on the surface here. Like a bubble.
0,152,14,BRATAC,Is it a cavern?
0,152,14,CARTER,It looks like a perfectly-formed half-sphere of molten rock.
0,152,14,RONAN,Perhaps a forcefield meant to protect the city was covered over.
0,152,14,CARTER,Too small to have a whole city in there and we arent getting any energy readings from it.
0,152,14,TEALC,Perhaps the shield has since failed.
0,152,14,CARTER,We should still check it out.
0,152,15,MAYNARD,"Mr President, weve managed to contact the captain of the Spruance, a destroyer in the Nimitz battle group."
0,152,15,CAPTAIN,"I repeat, some sort of beam just came out of the sky. There wasnt any warning, but the entire carrier just went up in one big fireball."
0,152,15,HAYES,"Captain, can you see the enemy?"
0,152,15,CAPTAIN,"Holy! Another cruiser just blew up. Where the hells the fire coming from? All ahead, flank ..."
0,152,15,MAYNARD,The engagement began less than five minutes ago. And that was only one Goauld ship.
0,152,16,BRATAC,Here. The crust may be thin enough for the rings to penetrate. Stand by.
0,152,17,SCOUT SHIP. RONAN,Can you still hear us?
0,152,17,TEALC,Indeed. Loudly and clearly.
0,152,17,BRATAC,We will move a safe distance and return on your signal.
0,152,18,CARTER,The radiation levels pretty high.
0,152,18,TEALC,I believe Ronan was correct. It seems a shield once protected this structure.
0,152,18,CARTER,Its possible the rings compromised the domes integrity. We shouldnt stay too long.
0,152,18,DANIEL,Too bad otherwise its very pleasant
0,152,18,DANIEL,Architecture definitely indicates this was built by the Ancients.
0,152,18,TEALC,This facility does not appear operational.
0,152,18,CARTER,"I dont know about you guys but right now Im kinda hopin that this isnt the lost city. Sir, be careful."
0,152,18,DANIEL,"Jack, you sure you know what youre doin?"
0,152,18,CARTER,The atmosphere is safe.
0,152,18,CARTER,Its a map of the galaxy.
0,152,18,DANIEL,Looks like every planet the Ancients ever colonised is indicated here. This is where we are Proklarush.
0,152,18,CARTER,Thats our solar system. . Earth!
0,152,18,TEALC,That does not appear to be Earth.
0,152,18,DANIEL,Thats because it doesnt take into consideration thirty million years of continental drift.
0,152,18,CARTER,"Sir, why are you showing us this?"
0,152,18,DANIEL,Jack?
0,152,18,ONEILL,Terra Atlantis.
0,152,18,DANIEL,Terras Earth. Atlantis ...
0,152,18,CARTER,The lost city of Atlantis?!
0,152,18,DANIEL,Are you say the lost city of the Ancients is here?
0,152,18,CARTER,Antarctica.
0,152,18,ONEILL,Subo glacios.
0,152,18,DANIEL,Under the ice. The city weve been looking for is under the ice of Antarctica.
0,152,18,CARTER,Its been on Earth the whole time?
0,152,18,DANIEL,"Jack, we were just there!"
0,152,18,CARTER,So we came all this way just to find out that we have to go all the way back.
0,152,18,ONEILL,No!
0,152,18,CARTER,"A power source. Bratac, were on our way. We know the location of the lost city. Its on Earth."
0,152,18,SCOUT SHIP. BRATAC,"Understood, Major Carter. Pilot the vessel. I will see to the transport rings. I am betrayed."
0,152,18,RONAN,"You are the betrayer of your one true god, Anubis."
0,152,18,BRATAC,"You should have struck for my heart, Ronan."
0,152,18,RONAN,You will die more slowly this way.
0,152,18,BRATAC,You are mistaken. I no longer carry a symbiote.
0,152,19,DANIEL,I dont think the domes gonna hold.
0,152,20,RONAN,"You are weak, old man."
0,152,20,CARTER,"Bratac, whats happening up there? The others help him up.)"
0,152,21,BRATAC,"You may be younger, but not the wiser."
0,152,22,CARTER,"Bratac, the dome is collapsing."
0,152,23,BRATAC,Secure the ship.
0,152,23,BRATAC,Ronan was an agent of Anubis.
0,152,23,TEALC,"Save your strength, old friend."
0,152,23,BRATAC,"You know that I am stubborn, Tealc, but this battle I fear I cannot win."
0,152,23,BRATAC,The pain ... is fading.
0,152,23,DANIEL,Jack ...
0,152,23,BRATAC,Once more I am in your debt.
0,152,23,CARTER,But how?
0,152,23,TEALC,ONeill possesses the healing power of the Ancients.
0,152,23,DANIEL,I guess your conditions a little more advanced than last time.
0,152,23,CARTER,"Tealc, set a course for Earth."
0,152,23,JUMPER,"Our FA-22s and ABLs are all in the air, but so far theres been nothing to intercept. Since the battle group was destroyed, the Goauld havent fired a shot."
0,152,23,SECURITY ADVISOR,"Why not a city or two, just to prove his point?"
0,152,23,MAYNARD,Hold your fire! Its a hologram.
0,152,23,ANUBIS,I am Anubis.
0,152,23,HAYES,Youve got to be kidding!
0,152,23,ANUBIS,You are the leader of this world.
0,152,23,HAYES,"Henry Hayes, President of the United States of America, one nation among many."
0,152,23,ANUBIS,No more. Bow before your god.
0,152,23,HAYES,"I dont think so! However, I am willing to discuss your surrender."
0,152,23,ANUBIS,"If you possessed weapons matching mine, you would have used them."
0,152,23,HAYES,"Dont let the suit fool you, fella. Were gonna fight you."
0,152,23,ANUBIS,You bring destruction upon yourselves.
0,152,23,HAYES,Never going to happen.
0,152,23,HAYES,Too much?
0,152,25,JUMPER,
0,152,25,HAYES,I guess he didnt buy it.
0,152,25,KINSEY,"Mr President, its time to go to the Alpha site. You can stay in contact and send any ..."
0,152,25,HAYES,"Bob, go ahead."
0,152,25,KINSEY,Mr President ...
0,152,25,HAYES,"No no, go ahead. Im, uh, Im staying."
0,152,25,HAYES,Youre all welcome to join him.
0,152,25,MAYNARD,"I think you know were staying here with you, sir."
0,152,25,HAYES,"God knows, George, you deserve the right to go."
0,152,25,HAMMOND,"No, sir, I think Ill stay as well."
0,152,25,HAYES,"Good. Well, if youll accept it, Ive got another job for you."
0,152,26,TEALC,"Are you preparing a weapon for battle, ONeill? Sensors have detected an armada of Goauld ships in orbit around Earth. Can you understand anything that I am saying, ONeill? ONeill, I wish for you to know ..."
0,152,26,MAYNARD,"Mr President, in the last two hours the enemy has focussed on systematically taking out power grids and broadcast terminals around the globe. They seem to want to disable our communications."
0,152,26,HAYES,So much for my speech.
0,152,26,SECURITY ADVISOR,Were doing our best to get the word out to the public to remain calm.
0,152,26,HAYES,Saying what?
0,152,26,SECURITY ADVISOR,For the moment were sticking with a meteor shower.
0,152,26,HAYES,"Thatll only hold up as long as those ships stay out of range. Go to DEFCON 1. John, launch Prometheus."
0,152,27,WEIR,Well I thought you were a lot of things a coward wasnt one of them.
0,152,27,KINSEY,"Im a pragmatist, Doctor. Besides, someone has to ensure the survival of the human race and the American way of life. By the way, if you survive, youre through."
0,152,27,KINSEY,What the hells going on?
0,152,27,PEARSON,Weve lost main power.
0,152,27,WEIR,Manual iris control close it now.
0,152,27,KINSEY,What the hell do you think youre doing? Open that iris and dial the Alpha site.
0,152,27,PEARSON,Unauthorised offworld activation.
0,152,27,PEARSON,That was a nuke or worse.
0,152,27,WEIR,Anubis has dialled in. Youre not going anywhere.
0,152,27,KINSEY,"You get me out of here, you hear me?"
0,152,27,PEARSON,Just received an encoded message from
0,152,27,TECH,Its not coming through the Gate.
0,152,27,KINSEY,I dont give a damn!
0,152,27,WEIR,Well I do!
0,152,28,HAYES,Doctor Weir?
0,152,29,WEIR,"Mr President, Prometheus cant win against an entire Goauld fleet but it could buy SG-1 enough time to complete their mission."
0,152,29,KINSEY,"Mr President, that is downright insane. I am relieving Doctor Weir and taking command of this ..."
0,152,29,WEIR,"Sir, from what Ive looked at ..."
0,152,29,HAYES,Will you shut the hell up?!
0,152,29,WEIR,"Im sorry, sir."
0,152,29,HAYES,"Not you, Doctor."
0,152,29,KINSEY,Excuse me?
0,152,29,HAYES,"Consider your resignation accepted, Bob."
0,152,29,KINSEY,You cant do that!
0,152,29,HAYES,"Oh please, I got enough on you to have you shot."
0,152,29,KINSEY,This is the biggest mistake you will ever make.
0,152,29,HAYES,"But I think Ill stick with my original thought, which is shut the hell up!"
0,152,29,KINSEY,I promise you will only live to regret this!
0,152,29,HAYES,"Go ahead, Doctor Weir."
0,152,29,WEIR,"I believe, sir, sending Prometheus to cover SG-1 is our best hope."
0,152,30,HAMMOND,"Colonel Kirkland, we have our orders. Lets get this bird in the air."
0,152,30,KIRKLAND,Set inertial compensators and shields at maximum. Initiate launch sequence.
0,152,31,DANIEL,Jacks modifying the matter stream transmitter on the rings. I think were gonna use it to bore a hole through the ice.
0,152,31,TEALC,We must first defeat the forces of Anubis.
0,152,31,DANIEL,"Yeah, howre we gonna do that?"
0,152,31,BRATAC,You must exit hyperspace as close to the Earths atmosphere as possible.
0,152,31,DANIEL,So we can appear on the other side of the armada.
0,152,31,BRATAC,There will not be much time to decelerate.
0,152,31,TEALC,"Of that I am aware, old friend."
0,152,32,DANIEL,"Tealc? Tealc, youre gonna pull up, right?"
0,152,32,TEALC,I am attempting to do so.
0,152,32,TEALC,Where now?
0,152,32,DANIEL,It has to be near the coordinates where we found the second Stargate.
0,152,32,HERAK,My Lord. A scout ship has exited hyperspace and is heading for the planets southern pole.
0,152,33,CARTER,"Sir, how long is this gonna take?"
0,152,33,TEALC,Anubis cannot have missed our arrival.
0,152,33,BRATAC,You are correct. Alkesh and gliders approach. Many. They will be in firing range in thirty seconds. More ships approaching from the opposite direction.
0,152,33,CARTER,"Sir, were about to get our a..."
0,152,33,BRATAC,They are not Goauld.
0,152,33,HAMMOND,Defend that scout ship at all costs.
0,152,33,CARTER,Prometheus!
0,152,33,HAMMOND,
0,152,33,CARTER,"Yes sir, its good to see you. Lets go."
0,152,35,CARTER,"Colonel, how are we gonna get down there?"
0,152,35,TEALC,The rings.
0,152,35,DANIEL,Makes sense. The Ancients built the Stargates there must be a set of rings down there somewhere.
0,152,35,CARTER,The transmission beam just couldnt penetrate a mile of ice.
0,152,35,GANT,Were taking damage to the outer hull.
0,152,35,DAVIS,All the remaining F-302s have expended their ordnance.
0,152,35,HAMMOND,We cant take them back aboard. Theyll have to divert to McMurdo.
0,152,35,KIRKLAND,We need to break off and recharge the shields.
0,152,35,HAMMOND,Hold your position.
0,152,36,CARTER,Ready.
0,152,36,BRATAC,Good luck.
0,152,38,HERAK,"We are in range, my lord."
0,152,38,ANUBIS,Fire.
0,152,39,KIRKLAND,Shields are failing.
0,152,39,GANT,Scout ship has cleared the hull.
0,152,39,HAMMOND,Set a course for Anubis mothership. Move us out of here.
0,152,39,KIRKLAND,Bringing main engines on line. Emergency thrust.
0,152,39,HERAK,Tauri vessel is abandoning its position.
0,152,39,CARTER,This looks vaguely familiar.
0,152,39,ONEILL,Dolmata.
0,152,39,DANIEL,Sleep.
