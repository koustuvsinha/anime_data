0,153,0,"""NEW ORDER I""",By Joseph Mallozzi & Paul Mullie Transcribed by
0,153,1,DANIEL,Doctor Weir.
0,153,1,WEIR,Elizabeth.
0,153,1,DANIEL,"Elizabeth. Almost ready. Cant believe were finally going. I mean, I know I should have been ready a long time ago but I needed some ..."
0,153,1,WEIR,The talks have stalled again.
0,153,1,DANIEL,Youre kidding me.
0,153,1,WEIR,Its a complicated situation.
0,153,1,DANIEL,The Antarctic Treaty was established to promote scientic research in the area.
0,153,1,WEIR,"With the interests of progress for *all* mankind, not just that of the United States. So argue the other eleven states, all claiming shared jurisdiction. I mean, Article 1 states quite clearly there can be no establishment of any military base, and no testing of any weapons. You saw first-hand how powerful the Ancient outpost is."
0,153,1,DANIEL,"And so meanwhile Jack just stays frozen in a stasis pod down there? He sacrificed himself to save us - *all* of us, not just this country."
0,153,1,WEIR,"I know, but the scale of Anubis attack makes covering it up tenuous at best. If were gonna keep the entire world from finding out everything to do with the Stargate, were gonna need the full co-operation of every government now aware of whats been going on. Its just gonna take more time."
0,153,1,DANIEL,"And in the meantime, we just sit here and do nothing."
0,153,1,WEIR,"Im sorry, Doctor Jackson."
0,153,1,DANIEL,Daniel.
0,153,1,WEIR,Daniel.
0,153,2,CARTER,We use the Gate.
0,153,2,WEIR,"Its not that we cant use it. Officially, all normal Gate activity will remain suspended. It will just be until the agreement for the Antarctic site is resolved."
0,153,2,CARTER,What does one have to do with the other?
0,153,2,WEIR,"While we obviously still have full jurisdictional control over the Stargate, the President feels that ultimately how we proceed with operations here at SGC will reflect on our international goodwill."
0,153,2,DANIEL,"In other words, its our political leverage in negotiations."
0,153,2,WEIR,I would *never* say that.
0,153,2,CARTER,What about Colonel ONeill?
0,153,2,WEIR,"Look, I know what he means to the three of you. We all appreciate the sacrifice Colonel ONeill made."
0,153,2,DANIEL,The Asgard can help him. Last time they were able to erase the Ancient knowledge from his mind before it killed him.
0,153,2,WEIR,Weve tried contacting them. What do you suggest we do?
0,153,2,CARTER,Youre aware of how we helped the Asgard trap the Replicators in the time dilation field on the planet Halla.
0,153,2,WEIR,"Something to that effect, yes - that was a couple of years ago, right?"
0,153,2,CARTER,"Basically we know that that trap is only gonna hold them for so long. Thor and the Asgard must be monitoring the situation. If we can get there, we should be able to contact them."
0,153,2,WEIR,Isnt the planet youre talking about in another galaxy?
0,153,2,DANIEL,Othalla.
0,153,2,TEALC,ONeill used his knowledge of the Ancients to modify the Goauld vessel currently in our possession.
0,153,2,WEIR,"According to your report, Major, that ship is capable of flying faster and farther than anything the Goauld have."
0,153,2,CARTER,Yes. I think it might just get us there.
0,153,2,WEIR,And back?
0,153,2,CARTER,That may be a problem. Theres a good chance the trip will burn out the engines.
0,153,2,WEIR,
0,153,2,CARTER,Were willing to take the risk.
0,153,2,WEIR,"As admirable as that is, I cant let you do it."
0,153,2,TEALC,For what reason?
0,153,2,WEIR,"Colonel ONeill was able to fend off Anubis fleet using the weapons from the Ancient outpost. Hopefully that will make the other Goauld think twice before attacking Earth in the foreseeable future but the truth is, we dont know if were ever going to be able to use those weapons again. And if we cant, were gonna need a new tactical advantage over the Goauld - at least thats what the Pentagon tells me; and the modified cargo ship - its too valuable right now. Im sorry - request denied."
0,153,3,WEIR,"What can I do for you, Major?"
0,153,3,CARTER,I want you to reconsider my request.
0,153,3,WEIR,Im sorry.
0,153,3,CARTER,"That cargo ship was modified using the knowledge of the Ancients. Now, there is no guarantee that *anyone* will *ever* be able to figure out how it was done."
0,153,3,WEIR,"And as the most likely person on the planet *to* figure it out, are you saying that if I dont let you attempt to contact the Asgard, you wont even try?"
0,153,3,CARTER,I would never say that.
0,153,3,WEIR,Right now that is the most advanced piece of technology we have.
0,153,3,CARTER,"If it werent for Colonel ONeill, we wouldnt *have* that ship. For that matter, we wouldnt even *be* here discussing this."
0,153,5,CARTER,"We got the co-ordinates from the Prometheus. Now based on the amount of time it took to get the modified ship from Taonas to Earth, Im estimating our trip to Othalla from Earth will take roughly ten days."
0,153,6,DANIEL,"Hey! So, uh, how did you talk Weir into letting us go?"
0,153,6,CARTER,"I didnt. I talked her into letting *us* go . Youre staying here. Daniel, even *with* the modifications to the ship theres no guarantee itll get us there, and if it *does* theres a good chance itll burn out the engines. The ship was never meant to fly at that speed which means, if we dont find the Asgard, well be stranded."
0,153,6,DANIEL,I know.
0,153,6,CARTER,We need you here. Youre our best chance at deciphering whatever informations in that Ancient outpost.
0,153,6,TEALC,"If we fail, you will be ONeills only hope."
0,153,7,CARTER,"Hey, Tealc. Can I get you anything? I packed lots of turkey - I know its your favourite."
0,153,7,TEALC,"Thank you, but I am not currently hungry. Have you been able to determine how ONeill modified the engines?"
0,153,7,CARTER,"No. Im just taking a break. I didnt think it would be easy, but at least its a good way to pass the time. Im sorry - have I been ignoring you?"
0,153,7,TEALC,I am fine.
0,153,7,CARTER,"I thought maybe working on the engines would help take my mind off Colonel ONeill ... which is kinda silly considering hes the one who modified them. Look, I know this plan isnt exactly foolproof. I have *never* plotted an intergalactic course before. I mean, if the co-ordinates are off by even one half of a percent we could wind up ten thousand light years from our destination. But still , tryin to stay positive."
0,153,7,TEALC,I have the utmost confidence in your ability.
0,153,7,CARTER,"I know. So, you wanna talk?"
0,153,7,TEALC,Concerning what subject?
0,153,7,CARTER,I dunno. Hows Ryac?
0,153,7,TEALC,Fine.
0,153,7,CARTER,You still keeping in touch with Ishta?
0,153,7,TEALC,Indeed.
0,153,7,CARTER,Bratac?
0,153,7,TEALC,Bratac is well.
0,153,7,CARTER,"Cmon, Tealc, throw me a bone here!"
0,153,7,TEALC,How is Pete Shanahan?
0,153,7,CARTER,Hes fine.
0,153,7,TEALC,Is not all well between the two of you?
0,153,7,CARTER,No! Everythings great. Its just - as you well know - its not easy saying goodbye to someone you care about when you think theres a chance you may never see them again. I know thats a risk we take every time we step through the Stargate but ... still ... try to stay positive. Ill get you a sandwich.
0,153,8,WEIR,Daniel.
0,153,8,DANIEL,Elizabeth. Just wondering if youd heard anything.
0,153,8,WEIR,Theyre still bogged down.
0,153,8,DANIEL,Its been over a week.
0,153,8,WEIR,"Well what do you expect? A quick round of handshakes, champagne toast, seal the deal?"
0,153,8,DANIEL,"We were attacked from space by an armada of alien ships. If that doesnt get us past our distrust of each other, what will?"
0,153,8,WEIR,"You forget those alien ships were destroyed by a single weapon. I mean, that kind of powers gonna give anyone cause for concern."
0,153,8,DANIEL,"Yup. Not that I want this to come off as an attempt to get rid of you, but, uh, isnt this sort of international negotiation exactly your area of expertise?"
0,153,9,DAVIS,Unauthorised offworld activation!
0,153,10,DAVIS,Were receiving a signal. Its a text message.
0,153,11,DANIEL,Its Goauld.
0,153,11,WEIR,What does it say?
0,153,11,DANIEL,"Um, its from one of the System Lords, Camulus, the Celtic god of war."
0,153,11,WEIR,Im not familiar with him.
0,153,11,DANIEL,"Um, weve never had any contact with him before. Wow."
0,153,11,WEIR,"Uh, yeah, of course, wow."
0,153,11,DANIEL,Sorry. It says he wants to arrange a meeting for the purpose of negotiating a treaty.
0,153,11,WEIR,A Goauld wants to arrange a treaty with us?
0,153,11,DANIEL,Not just one Goauld - all of them. The System Lords. They wanna send representatives here.
0,153,11,TEALC,We are preparing to emerge from hyperspace.
0,153,11,CARTER,"As soon as we drop out Ill start broadcasting a signal. If the Asgard are monitoring the region, they should find us."
0,153,12,TEALC,Should we not be able to see the planet?
0,153,12,CARTER,Yes.
0,153,12,TEALC,We are experiencing the effects of an extremely powerful gravitational force.
0,153,12,CARTER,"Somethings not right. Tealc, turn us around and get us outta here now."
0,153,12,TEALC,"Hyperspace generator will not engage. Sub-light engines are at maximum, yet we are not moving."
0,153,12,CARTER,Theres only one thing I know of that could create this kind of gravitational pull.
0,153,14,WEIR,Youre sure this is an accurate translation of the message?
0,153,14,DANIEL,Pretty much.
0,153,14,WEIR,What do you make of it?
0,153,14,DANIEL,"Well, to be honest Im not sure *what* to think."
0,153,14,WEIR,The Goauld did come here once to negotiate a treaty.
0,153,14,DANIEL,"Yeah, with the Asgard, not with us. Earth just served as neutral territory. For them to want to meet with us as equals is extremely unusual."
0,153,14,WEIR,Maybe we gained a bit of respect in their eyes.
0,153,14,DANIEL,"Yeah, they must have heard what happened to Anubis. They couldnt defeat him, not with all their combined forces and we did it in a single day."
0,153,14,WEIR,Which may explain why they wanna come here.
0,153,14,DANIEL,Yeah - to see how we did it.
0,153,15,CARTER,Its pretty much what we expected - we burned out the hyperdrive getting here.
0,153,16,TEALC,That is most unfortunate.
0,153,16,CARTER,"Even if it *was* working, it would have been very dangerous to open a window this close to the event horizon of a black hole."
0,153,16,TEALC,Are we that far off course?
0,153,16,CARTER,No! We came out of hyperspace right where we were supposed to. This just doesnt make any sense. Hallas sun wasnt nearly massive enough to collapse into a black hole.
0,153,16,TEALC,Yet that is what appears to be happening.
0,153,16,CARTER,Ill see if I can get a little more out of the sub-light engines.
0,153,17,WEIR,The President has authorised me to pursue negotiations with the Goauld.
0,153,17,OK.,
0,153,17,WEIR,You dont think I can handle it?
0,153,17,DANIEL,"I didnt say that, but, if I may, *you* dont sound all that confident."
0,153,17,WEIR,"Well, as you said, I have brokered my share of international negotiations; this will just be my first *interplanetary* one."
0,153,17,DANIEL,"The System Lords cant be trusted, either as a group or individuals. Theyre posturing egomaniacs driven by an insatiable lust for power, each one capable of unimaginable evil."
0,153,17,WEIR,"See - why should I be nervous?! Sounds like an average day at the United Nations. Look, Im not afraid to admit that I need help. So what can you tell me?"
0,153,17,DANIEL,"The High Council of the System Lords is a rather flimsy coalition of the most powerful Goaulds in the galaxy who only co-operate when it suits them. Their numbers vary from time to time - new ones rise up, old ones get knocked off. We think theres about a dozen right now. Ive put together a summary of what we know."
0,153,17,WEIR,Alright. I assume I cant just open the iris and let the representatives just walk through.
0,153,17,DANIEL,"No, that would probably be a bad idea. We should get them to meet us in a neutral location, preferably a planet of our choosing. Send a team, make sure theyre unarmed and then escort them back."
0,153,17,WEIR,Good. Send the message.
0,153,18,TEALC,We are now being pulled backwards. Advise that we divert power from the shields.
0,153,18,CARTER,Right now theyre the only thing holding the ship together. Drop them and the gravitational fields will tear us apart.
0,153,18,TEALC,I do not believe there is any other choice.
0,153,19,CARTER,Diverting power.
0,153,19,TEALC,We are now moving forward.
0,153,19,CARTER,Its not gonna be good enough - were losing hull integrity.
0,153,20,CARTER,Weve got a hull breach!
0,153,20,THOR,Greetings!
0,153,20,CARTER,Thor!
0,153,20,THOR,"It is good to see you again, Major Carter, Tealc."
0,153,20,CARTER,Likewise!
0,153,20,TEALC,Indeed. Your timing is impeccable.
0,153,21,WEIR,So the Goauld have agreed to our terms for their travel here.
0,153,21,DANIEL,"Yeah. I was just going over some research material on the delegates theyre sending. Camulus is the one who sent the original message. Then theres Amaterasu, the Japanese sun goddess; and the last one is Lord Yu."
0,153,21,WEIR,Yu?!
0,153,21,DANIEL,"Dont. Every joke, every pun, done to death, seriously."
0,153,21,WEIR,"I just thought I remembered reading he was not himself, or something. Of course, for a Goauld, what that means exactly, Im not sure. Please, continue."
0,153,21,DANIEL,"Well, he no longer has the ability to take on a new host and it seems the regenerative powers of the sarcophagus are losing its effectiveness for him. Basically, hes suffering from old age."
0,153,21,WEIR,Hes senile. Why did they choose him as a representative?
0,153,21,DANIEL,"Well, his underlings may be doing a good job of covering for him."
0,153,21,WEIR,The other System Lords dont know.
0,153,21,DANIEL,"The interesting thing is, Lord Yu is the one System Lord who opposed Anubis desire to be reinstated to the Council after his banishment. Long story. The point is that he fell out of favour when the other System Lords accepted Anubis back and he used his power to become an effective leader."
0,153,21,WEIR,"So now that Anubis has gone, you think the balance of power shifted back to Yu."
0,153,21,DANIEL,"On the bright side, out of all the Goauld, Lord Yu has been the most co-operative with us in the past."
0,153,21,WEIR,I thought you said none of them could be trusted.
0,153,21,DANIEL,"Oh, they cant, especially not a ... crazy one."
0,153,21,WEIR,Huh - thats the bright side?
0,153,21,DANIEL,More of a slightly less dark side.
0,153,21,THOR,"I am afraid I cannot leave this sector, Major, not at the moment."
0,153,21,CARTER,"Thor, youre the only one who can save Colonel ONeill."
0,153,21,THOR,"As you have said, he is being preserved in stasis at the moment. I will be glad to return with you to Earth as soon as my mission here is completed."
0,153,21,TEALC,What is your mission?
0,153,21,THOR,I must wait here until I am certain the Replicators have been destroyed. You may have noticed that Hallas sun has collapsed into a black hole.
0,153,21,CARTER,Just before the back of our ship was torn off.
0,153,21,THOR,Im sorry I did not reach you sooner. I was not expecting you.
0,153,21,CARTER,"Yeah, you havent been responding to our attempts to contact you."
0,153,21,THOR,I am sorry. Time/space distortions caused by the black hole have been interfering with my ships long-range communications.
0,153,21,CARTER,Understandable.
0,153,21,TEALC,Indeed - for some.
0,153,21,THOR,The time dilation field was only a temporary measure. We knew the time it would take for the Replicator humans to reach the machine would translate to less than two years outside the field. Therefore a more permanent solution was devised.
0,153,21,CARTER,So you collapsed the sun.
0,153,21,THOR,"By artificially increasing its gravitational field, yes."
0,153,21,CARTER,Thats ... pretty cool!
0,153,21,THOR,"As you can see, the planet has already broken apart. However, a large number of Replicators have managed to come together in a coherent mass that has yet to pass the event horizon."
0,153,21,CARTER,"Well, even if they can withstand the gravitational force without being torn apart, theres no way they could ever"
0,153,21,THOR,Interesting.
0,153,21,CARTER,What is it?
0,153,21,THOR,The mass of Replicator blocks have begun moving away from the event horizon.
0,153,21,CARTER,How is that possible?
0,153,21,THOR,"They have the time dilation device. I do not know exactly how, but they seem to have used it to counteract the gravitational effects that should be pulling them in."
0,153,21,CARTER,"Frightening - not only that they can do that, but you dont know how."
0,153,21,THOR,I agree. They are picking up speed. Scans indicate the blocks have formed together.
0,153,21,TEALC,Into what?
0,153,21,THOR,A ship. They *are* escaping. Their course indicates they are headed this way.
0,153,22,WEIR,I thought you were going to stand me up.
0,153,22,DANIEL,"Yeah, sorry. Heard anything from Tealc and Sam?"
0,153,22,WEIR,No.
0,153,22,DAVIS,"Receiving a signal, maam. SG-7 reports that we have a green light."
0,153,22,WEIR,Open the iris.
0,153,22,WEIR,Welcome to Earth. Allow me to introduce
0,153,22,CAMULUS,We are not interested in your name.
0,153,22,WEIR,Really? I generally find it helps so much.
0,153,22,AMATERASU,"We prefer to present our offer, so we can spend as brief a time as possible on this planet."
0,153,23,WEIR,Right this way.
0,153,24,CARTER,Have you ever seen anything like it?
0,153,24,THOR,"No, and it is doubtful my ships weapons will be effective against it."
0,153,24,CARTER,"We should probably get out of here, then, huh? Can you jump into hyperspace?"
0,153,24,THOR,We must clear the gravitational distortion field of the black hole first. They have fired upon us.
0,153,24,CARTER,Can it penetrate your shields?
0,153,24,THOR,It is more than likely. Brace for impact. The hull has been breached.
0,153,24,CARTER,Where?
0,153,24,THOR,The damage is minimal. The projectile was likely composed of Replicators. They are not visible to my ships scanners. This is how they have boarded Asgard ships in the past.
0,153,24,CARTER,Can you use the shields to prevent decompression in those sections?
0,153,24,THOR,Yes.
0,153,25,CAMULUS,"Your unexpected defeat of Anubis has created an unstable situation among the System Lords. In order to avoid open war, we came to an agreement to divide his territories and his armies evenly."
0,153,25,DANIEL,How civilised of you
0,153,25,CAMULUS,"Yes. Unfortunately, one of those among us has broken that agreement."
0,153,25,DANIEL,"Oh, no, no, no, dont tell me, let me guess, its, um ..."
0,153,25,AMATERASU,Baal.
0,153,25,DANIEL,Baal!
0,153,25,CAMULUS,He was able to learn the location of the planet where Anubis was creating his Kull warriors.
0,153,25,DANIEL,Baal got there before you did and found a way to reprogramme the soldiers to serve him.
0,153,25,AMATERASU,"With those Orac at his command, Baal has tipped the balance of power in his favour."
0,153,25,WEIR,Orac?
0,153,25,DANIEL,Unspeakable.
0,153,25,CAMULUS,"In battle, the Kull are far superior to the Jaffa. Already many among us have begun to speak of capitulation, much as they did with Anubis. If that happens, Baal will indeed be unstoppable."
0,153,25,WEIR,"Well, this is all very interesting, Im sure, but I fail to see what it has to do with us."
0,153,26,OSHU,"My master wishes to say it is well known the Tauri possess a powerful new weapon, something far beyond their current level of technology."
0,153,26,DANIEL,"Yes, we used it to kill Anubis and destroy his fleet."
0,153,26,OSHU,"By means of this weapon, Baal can be prevented from conquering the galaxy."
0,153,27,TEAL'C,"Major Carter! Thor, it is Tealc. Major Carter was beamed away. Is she in your presence?"
0,153,27,THOR,I did not do it. The Replicators must have her.
0,153,28,TEAL'C,I have eliminated all of the Replicators I could locate.
0,153,28,THOR,There is no way of knowing if there are more. The Replicator ship has entered hyperspace.
0,153,28,TEAL'C,Can you follow?
0,153,28,THOR,Yes.
0,153,28,CAMULUS,"If Baal defeats us, how long do you think it will be before he turns his attention to you?"
0,153,28,WEIR,"If he does, hell suffer the same fate as Anubis."
0,153,28,AMATERASU,"Perhaps, but there are other worlds in this galaxy without the luxury of such advanced defences."
0,153,28,DANIEL,What are you talking about?
0,153,28,AMATERASU,"We could not help but notice that the Asgard did not come to your aid when Anubis threatened your planet. In fact, weve heard nothing from the Asgard for quite some time now."
0,153,28,DANIEL,"Really? Thats odd, cos we talk to them all the time."
0,153,28,WEIR,The Asgard didnt come because they knew it wasnt necessary.
0,153,28,AMATERASU,Baal believes otherwise. He is convinced that the Asgard can no longer exercise power in this galaxy. He intends to take the planets protected under the Goauld/Asgard treaty for himself.
0,153,28,CAMULUS,"If you do not help us stop him, millions of humans will die, and millions more will be enslaved."
0,153,29,TEAL'C,Do you know its destination?
0,153,29,THOR,"Before you destroyed them, the Replicators managed to access the ships computer. They learned the location of Orilla, the planet where we are attempting to rebuild the Asgard civilisation. I assumed it would be their first target."
0,153,29,TEAL'C,What is your reasoning?
0,153,29,THOR,"Orilla is rich in neutronium, which is a key element in Asgard technology. It is also essential for the creation of human-form Replicators."
0,153,30,FIFTH,Major Carter.
0,153,30,CARTER,Fifth!
0,153,30,FIFTH,I imagine you never expected to see me again.
0,153,30,CARTER,"Im sorry we left you behind, but we had to do it. We couldnt risk the others getting out. You know what theyre capable of. I know you must be upset."
0,153,30,FIFTH,Upset.
0,153,30,CARTER,"We betrayed you. It must have hurt. See, thats the part of you thats most like us, the human part of you. I understand how you feel."
0,153,30,FIFTH,"No you dont! You couldnt! But I promise you, you will."
0,153,32,WEIR,How many planets are protected under this treaty?
0,153,32,DANIEL,"Um, twenty-six. Twenty-seven if you include Earth."
0,153,32,WEIR,And what good is it if the Asgard arent actually available to protect anything?
0,153,32,DANIEL,"At one time they were - more recently weve been trading on the *threat*, kind of a big bluff."
0,153,32,WEIR,"Well, Baal is about to *call* the bluff."
0,153,32,DANIEL,Unfortunately theres nothing we can do about that. Earth is safe so long as the Goauld think we can defend ourselves.
0,153,32,WEIR,But thats a bluff too.
0,153,32,DANIEL,"Yeah, more or less."
0,153,32,WEIR,"When I was a kid, my dad used to have these weekly poker games. All I remember is smoke making my eyes water. Im starting to wish Id paid more attention."
0,153,32,DANIEL,Im sure youve misrepresented the truth before in negotiations.
0,153,32,WEIR,"Actually, no - my job has usually been to get people to *recognise* the truth."
0,153,32,DANIEL,"Well if they even get a hint of the fact that we cant use the Ancient weapon to defend ourselves, trust me, this game is over. Too dramatic?"
0,153,32,WEIR,"At this point, not for me."
0,153,33,TEAL'C,How can we stop them?
0,153,33,THOR,"My ships weapons will not function in hyperspace, much like the shields. However, in close proximity, the self-destruct may be sufficient to eliminate both ships. I am sorry, but we have no choice. If the human-form Replicators reach Orilla, they will have the resources to replicate many thousands of times. We cannot allow that to happen."
0,153,33,TEAL'C,So be it.
0,153,34,CARTER,Why are you *doing* this?
0,153,34,FIFTH,You think you deserve better?
0,153,34,CARTER,You can *see* my thoughts. You *know* I didnt wanna do it.
0,153,34,FIFTH,"I suppose in a way I should thank you. It was because of what you did to me I came to realise my full potential. I am more human than the others. At first I thought it was weakness, but now I see it makes me capable of so much more."
0,153,34,CARTER,"Fifth, please!"
0,153,34,FIFTH,"My brothers and sisters will devour entire civilisations in order to replicate, but they will know nothing of cruelty, or betrayal, or revenge. Not like us. Isnt that right, Major Carter?"
0,153,34,CARTER,No.
0,153,35,WEIR,"We appreciate you bringing us this information, but it doesnt change the fact that we cant get involved in any internal Goauld dispute, and if Baal tries to attack any of the protected planets, hell suffer the consequences."
0,153,35,CAMULUS,"Unfortunately, we do not share your faith in the Asgard. We must stop Baal before it comes to that."
0,153,35,WEIR,"Youll forgive my bluntness, but thats not our problem."
0,153,36,YU,"Enough! With each passing moment, Anubis grows more powerful!"
0,153,37,DANIEL,You mean Baal.
0,153,37,OSHU,My master is fatigued. We request a short adjournment.
0,153,37,YU,Silence! I need no adjournment.
0,153,37,CAMULUS,"We know you have a formidable new defensive weapon, but with it you must wait for your enemies to come to you, and that can be dangerous. What if an enemy were to devise a means of defeating this weapon?"
0,153,37,WEIR,What exactly are you offering?
0,153,37,CAMULUS,Hyperdrive engines.
0,153,37,AMATERASU,We know you have battleships that are not capable of interstellar travel.
0,153,37,CAMULUS,We are offering you a means of producing a fleet of ships as advanced as the Goauld Hatak vessels. You could take the fight to the enemy.
0,153,38,THOR,We are almost in range ... Now. We are slowing down. Something is interfering with the controls. The auxiliary control console outside the engine room.
0,153,39,WEIR,"Your offer is very generous, but Im afraid were going to have to decline."
0,153,39,CAMULUS,You would be able to uphold the Protected Planets Treaty with or without the aid of the Asgard.
0,153,39,DANIEL,How many hyperdrives are you willing to give us?
0,153,39,AMATERASU,How many ships can you build?
0,153,39,DANIEL,"I think the real question is: how many ships do you *have*? I mean, if were gonna enforce this treaty ourselves, we need to build enough ships to match any fleet that would oppose us."
0,153,39,CAMULUS,We are not at liberty to disclose such information.
0,153,39,WEIR,"Well then, this discussion is over."
0,153,39,AMATERASU,How can you blindly reject such an offer?
0,153,39,WEIR,"Because were not about to fight your battles for you in exchange for a couple of hyperdrive engines that may or may not do us any good in the long run, and especially since we already have that technology at our disposal."
0,153,40,CAMULUS,You have viable hyperdrive technology?
0,153,40,WEIR,"Yes, we do, and with the help of the Asgard, we are in the process of implementing it right now. So, thank you very much."
0,153,40,AMATERASU,"This Ancient weapon: such an advanced piece of technology. The power requirements must be enormous. Even simple maintenance must be extremely difficult, given your limited capabilities."
0,153,40,WEIR,We manage.
0,153,40,AMATERASU,"Of course, we believe you. But I wonder what Baal would think if he were to receive intelligence that the weapon was temporarily out of commission."
0,153,40,CAMULUS,Hmm. He would come to this world to claim it for himself. The Tauri would be forced to destroy him.
0,153,40,AMATERASU,And we would have to give them nothing.
0,153,40,DANIEL,"Oh, come on! Baal would never fall for that. He knows how desperate you are. I think he might find this information a little bit convenient ..."
0,153,40,CAMULUS,"Perhaps, but you leave us few options."
0,153,40,WEIR,
0,153,40,DANIEL,We *will*?!
0,153,40,WEIR,"In exchange, we want Baals territory."
0,153,40,CAMULUS,What do you mean?
0,153,40,WEIR,"Well thats the way it works, right? When one System Lord kills another, he takes over his armies, his fleet, his planets. Thats what we want - everything in Baals possession."
0,153,40,AMATERASU,You cannot be serious.
0,153,40,WEIR,"If were gonna be the ones who destroy Baal for you, why should we settle for anything less?"
0,153,40,CAMULUS,Preposterous. We cant accept those terms.
0,153,40,WEIR,Take it or leave it.
0,153,40,CAMULUS,We must send a message to the other System Lords to advise them of the current situation.
0,153,40,WEIR,Go ahead.
0,153,41,TEAL'C,The problem has been eliminated.
0,153,41,THOR,Unfortunately the Replicators are now beyond our reach. We are too late to stop them from reaching the new Asgard homeworld.
0,153,42,DANIEL,I guess you *did* learn something from your fathers poker games.
0,153,42,WEIR,Always bet big when bluffing?
0,153,42,DANIEL,I just didnt know you were looking to become a System Lord.
0,153,42,WEIR,I just had to do something to keep them talking. It looked like they were going to try and draw Baal here no matter what we said.
0,153,42,DANIEL,You can be pretty sure theyre not gonna agree to our terms.
0,153,42,WEIR,I know. We may have to revive Colonel ONeill.
0,153,42,DANIEL,What?!
0,153,42,WEIR,"If they suspect were bluffing, theyll come here and take the weapon for themselves. If they dont, theyll trick Baal into coming. Either way we may actually have to use that weapon again, to defend this planet."
0,153,42,DANIEL,We dont even know if theres enough power to fire another shot.
0,153,42,WEIR,I know.
0,153,42,DANIEL,"If you try to revive Jack without the Asgard standing by, itll kill him. In fact, hell probably die before he can do anything to help us."
0,153,43,DAVIS,Doctor Weir. Its a copy of the message the Goauld sent back to the System Lords. Its coded.
0,153,44,WEIR,We need to know what theyre thinking.
0,153,44,THOR,"I have managed to send advance warning to Orilla. By providing them with the Replicator ships course and speed, they should have a fair approximation of where it will drop out of hyperspace. What ships we have available will be waiting in ambush."
0,153,44,TEAL'C,You believe the Asgard ships can destroy the Replicators before they can raise their shields.
0,153,44,THOR,"They will only be defenceless for a few moments, but if my calculations are accurate, that should be sufficient."
0,153,45,CARTER,"Stop it, please!"
0,153,45,FIFTH,Why should I?
0,153,45,CARTER,You cant change what happened. Is this making you feel better? I never intended to abandon you.
0,153,45,FIFTH,"But you did. You gained my trust, then you used me and left me behind."
0,153,45,CARTER,It wasnt my decision.
0,153,45,FIFTH,You could have come back for me.
0,153,45,CARTER,There was no time!
0,153,45,FIFTH,"Time! Thanks to what you did, I had plenty of time to think about what a fool I was."
0,153,45,CARTER,Im sorry. Im sorry for what we did to you.
0,153,45,FIFTH,"Yes, you are now."
0,153,45,CARTER,"Part of being human is having compassion, learning to forgive."
0,153,45,FIFTH,Yes. Im not there yet. I need more time.
0,153,47,WEIR,Progress?
0,153,47,DANIEL,"Yeah, its basically a confirmation of what we suspected. They think were bluffing but have no way of confirming their suspicions, so theyre not sure what to do."
0,153,47,WEIR,"They could still try and draw Baal here, let him figure it out for them."
0,153,47,DANIEL,"Yeah, thats dangerous for them, because if we cant power the weapon ..."
0,153,47,WEIR,... which we cant ...
0,153,47,DANIEL,... Baal would end up with both Earth *and* the Ancient outpost in his possession.
0,153,48,DAVIS,Unscheduled offworld activation.
0,153,48,WEIR,"This is Weir, whats happening? ... OK, well be right down. Our guests just got a response."
0,153,49,AEGIR,"Commander Thor, this is Aegir of the Valhalla. We have assumed defensive positions and are awaiting the target ship."
0,153,49,THOR,Understood.
0,153,49,AEGIR,The enemy ship has been destroyed.
0,153,50,THOR,"I am sorry, Tealc."
0,153,51,DANIEL,I need to see the most recent message they received.
0,153,53,WEIR,Its unfortunate youre being recalled. I thought we were making such good progress.
0,153,53,CAMULUS,Your demands were ridiculous. We had no choice but to terminate negotiations.
0,153,53,WEIR,"Well, give my regards to Baal."
0,153,54,DANIEL,Shut it down.
0,153,54,DAVIS,What?!
0,153,54,AMATERASU,What is the meaning of this?!
0,153,54,DANIEL,The second message. Theyve been recalled because the System Lords have decided to test our defences. Theyre sending a ship to attack Earth. Itll be here within the hour.
