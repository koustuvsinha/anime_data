0,154,0,"""NEW ORDER II""",By Robert C. Cooper Transcribed by
0,154,1,YU,We are political dignitaries! How dare you prevent us from leaving!
0,154,1,WEIR,"Sending ships here to attack us is an act of war, and a foolish one at that, given what our defences are capable of."
0,154,1,OSHU,My lord did not order such action.
0,154,1,DANIEL,Then undo it. Tell the System Lords to call the ship back.
0,154,1,AMATERASU,"The decision they have made is one of desperation, forced upon them by your unwillingness to help. Persuading them to change course can only be done in person."
0,154,1,OSHU,With a full Council vote.
0,154,1,WEIR,"Even if I did believe you, all good faith is out the window at this point. Youre our prisoners. Take them away!"
0,154,3,PENEGAL,"Greetings, Thor."
0,154,3,THOR,"Greetings. Tealc, this is Penegal of the Asgard High Council."
0,154,3,PENEGAL,I regret to report that the debris from the destroyed Replicator ship cannot be contained. We were unable to prevent countless Replicator blocks from raining down on Orilla. They have already begun replicating and infesting our systems. Control of the city is in jeopardy.
0,154,3,TEAL'C,Should you not consider evacuating your people?
0,154,3,PENEGAL,That is no longer possible.
0,154,3,THOR,"There are too many. We carried numerous stored minds aboard the computers of our ships when we fled our homeworld. When Orilla was finally found, we were able to place those minds into cloned bodies so that we could build our new colony."
0,154,3,PENEGAL,"The Replicators have already infected systems needed to save those minds. If we lose this battle, they will perish along with their bodies, taking with them the hopes of the Asgard race."
0,154,3,THOR,Orilla is the last chance of ever rebuilding our empire.
0,154,3,TEAL'C,Then we must find a way to save it.
0,154,4,OFFICER,"Sir, sensors are detecting an alien vessel. It exited hyperspace fourteen thousand kilometres out, eight degrees starboard."
0,154,4,PENDERGAST,Designation.
0,154,4,OFFICER,"None yet, sir. Vessel is the size of a Goauld mothership, closing fast. Visual range in six seconds."
0,154,4,PENDERGAST,Hold your position. Prepare to fire.
0,154,4,OFFICER,"Four, three, two, one."
0,154,4,PENDERGAST,"Onscreen, maximum magnification. Open a channel  broadcast on all frequencies and translate into Goauld."
0,154,4,OFFICER,"Yes, sir."
0,154,4,PENDERGAST,"This is Colonel Lionel Pendergast of the United States Air Force Prometheus. Unidentified vessel, failure to reply will constitute an act of aggression and we will respond with the full force of our weapons."
0,154,5,TEAL'C,That will be unnecessary.
0,154,5,OFFICER,Tealc.
0,154,5,TEAL'C,"I offer greetings from Thor, the Supreme Commander of the Asgard fleet. We are aboard the Daniel Jackson."
0,154,6,WEIR,I have just received word that the Asgard have arrived. They want to witness the demonstration of our new Ancient defence technology that you have forced us into. Theres still time to call off the attack.
0,154,6,AMATERASU,We would also like to witness the demonstration.
0,154,7,DANIEL,"Your ship isnt coming. It was destroyed en route by Baal. The collective forces of the System Lords are bowing, and youre losing the war."
0,154,7,YU,And so are you.
0,154,7,DANIEL,Hey guys!
0,154,7,THOR,Our new colony is in grave jeopardy. The Replicators escaped from the time dilation device and are threatening to destroy the Asgard.
0,154,7,DANIEL,
0,154,7,TEAL'C,Thor believes the Ancient knowledge stored in ONeills mind may be the key to defeating the Replicators once and for all.
0,154,7,DANIEL,"Jacks frozen down in Antarc ... ... tica. As I was saying, wheres Sam?"
0,154,7,TEAL'C,She was captured by the Replicators. Their ship was destroyed.
0,154,10,PETE,"Hey, sleepyhead! Didnt think youd ever get up! It *was* kinda a long night, huh?!"
0,154,10,CARTER,Pete.
0,154,10,PETE,Whats up? Are you OK? Something wrong?
0,154,10,CARTER,Yes! *Everything!*
0,154,10,PETE,What do you mean?
0,154,10,CARTER,*This!* What are you doing here? What am *I* doing here?! Where the hell *is* here?!
0,154,10,PETE,"That was good. You had me  you really had me! Of course, Ive been up since five feeding the pigs and chickens."
0,154,10,CARTER,"No, Pete, honestly, I dont ..."
0,154,10,PETE,What? You dont what?
0,154,10,CARTER,Think this is real.
0,154,10,PETE,"You hungry? Im starving. Cmon, well go inside, Ill whip you up some pancakes."
0,154,10,CARTER,"You dont understand. This isnt happening. The last thing I remember, I was onboard a Replicator ship. This is just another way of screwing with my mind."
0,154,10,PETE,
0,154,10,CARTER,Yes.
0,154,10,PETE,"Then snap out of it. OK, pancakes, or do I have to call the doctor?"
0,154,10,CARTER,I *am* kinda hungry.
0,154,10,PETE,Good. Cmon.
0,154,11,DANIEL,What are you gonna do?
0,154,11,THOR,Im going to merge ONeills mind with the ships computer.
0,154,11,DANIEL,"To do that, youre gonna have to defrost him first, right? I bring this up because he was near death when we froze him."
0,154,11,THOR,Hopefully the pod will sustain his life.
0,154,11,DANIEL,Hopefully?!
0,154,11,THOR,What other choice do we have?
0,154,11,DANIEL,"Well cant you just save him, like the last time this happened? Just wipe the Ancient knowledge from his mind."
0,154,11,THOR,And lose any chance of finding a means to defeat the Replicators.
0,154,11,DANIEL,You have no right to risk his life.
0,154,11,TEAL'C,I believe ONeill would approve.
0,154,11,DANIEL,"We cant make that choice for him, no matter whats at stake. Cant you just extract the Ancient information into the ships computer? Then we can all benefit from it, even learn how to use the Ancient weapons on Earth."
0,154,11,THOR,"You cannot even begin to comprehend the extent of what was unfolding in ONeills mind. Our scientists, long ago, extracted parts of the Ancient library of knowledge and learned much from it. But we have been studying it for as long as I can remember, and *we* have barely scratched the surface."
0,154,11,DANIEL,So wed be looking for a needle in a haystack.
0,154,11,THOR,A haystack of infinite size.
0,154,11,DANIEL,Thats big.
0,154,11,THOR,I am hoping ONeills conscious mind can provide us with a direct conduit to the information we need.
0,154,12,WEIR,You requested to see me?
0,154,12,OSHU,You must let us go.
0,154,12,WEIR,I dont have to do anything at this point. If thats what ... .
0,154,12,OSHU,"If your attempt is to extract information from us, you should know I will die before I say anything, and nothing my master says can be trusted."
0,154,12,WEIR,"Look, no-ones decided what to do with you."
0,154,12,OSHU,"Anubis was over-confident, and he still needed the bulk of his armada to keep the System Lords at bay. The fleet he used to attack Earth was small compared to that which Baal will command should he defeat the System Lords. He will rule the galaxy. No weapons will be powerful enough to stop him."
0,154,12,WEIR,What would you have me do?
0,154,12,OSHU,"Free us to fight, or  if we must  die with honour."
0,154,12,THOR,He is not well.
0,154,12,DANIEL,I told you.
0,154,12,THOR,The process of interfacing his mind is complex.
0,154,12,ONEILLS VOICE,"Hello. Testing, testing. One, two. One, two, one, two, testing. Helloooo? Is this thing on?"
0,154,12,DANIEL,Jack?
0,154,12,THOR,"ONeill, can you hear us?"
0,154,12,ONEILLS VOICE,"Hey! Hey, guys! Whats goin on?"
0,154,12,THOR,Your mind has been interfaced with the Daniel Jackson.
0,154,12,O'NEILL,What?
0,154,12,DANIEL,What?!
0,154,12,TEAL'C,The name of Thors ship is Daniel Jackson.
0,154,13,THOR,All the information in the ships computer is available to you.
0,154,13,ONEILLS VOICE,"Ah, right, here we go. Ah, this is cool. I can pretty much do anything I want, cant I?"
0,154,14,THOR,ONeill.
0,154,14,ONEILLS VOICE,What? Oh. Sorry.
0,154,14,THOR,"If you wish, you may appear to us as a hologram."
0,154,15,ONEILLS HOLOGRAM,Uh!
0,154,15,DANIEL,You OK?
0,154,15,ONEILLS HOLOGRAM,"Its a little weird. But yeah, Im OK."
0,154,15,DANIEL,At least youre not speaking Ancient.
0,154,15,ONEILLS HOLOGRAM,Theres that.
0,154,15,THOR,"Actually, the computer is translating."
0,154,15,ONEILLS HOLOGRAM,Ah. Ive never looked better.
0,154,15,THOR,"There is not much time, ONeill."
0,154,15,TEAL'C,Thors planet ...
0,154,15,ONEILLS HOLOGRAM,I know. Ships log.
0,154,15,THOR,Can you help with the Replicators?
0,154,15,ONEILLS HOLOGRAM,Already on it.
0,154,15,DANIEL,Jack ...
0,154,15,ONEILLS HOLOGRAM,"Daniel, the computer recorded the whole conversation. Thanks for your concern. Talk amongst yourselves."
0,154,16,WEIR,Ive discussed the situation with my superiors  weve decided to let you all go.
0,154,16,CAMULUS,"I must admit, that comes as a surprise."
0,154,16,WEIR,"Well, it seems we havent had much success interrogating Goaulds in the past. It was made apparent to me youre much more use to us fighting Baal."
0,154,16,CAMULUS,Doctor Weir.
0,154,16,WEIR,You know my name.
0,154,16,CAMULUS,This may come as a surprise to you.
0,154,16,WEIR,"Oh, Im not sure anything can surprise me at this point."
0,154,16,CAMULUS,I wish to request asylum.
0,154,16,WEIR,"Well, seems I was wrong again."
0,154,16,CAMULUS,"My fleet was destroyed before I came here  of the many, among the first to fall. I have nothing left with which to fight. The only thing waiting for me through the Stargate is shame and torture. So it is not true that I would be more useful to you out there. Perhaps I could be of some use to you here."
0,154,17,CARTER,Thanks. That was great. Tasted very real.
0,154,17,PETE,"Hey, I was thinking we could go into town tonight  have dinner, see a movie."
0,154,17,CARTER,"Come on, you cant really expect me to just play along."
0,154,17,PETE,I gave up my job for this! I gave up my *life* for you!
0,154,17,CARTER,"See, that is definitely not Pete."
0,154,17,PETE,How patient do you expect me to be?
0,154,17,CARTER,"Nothing you say is gonna convince me. I know who you are, I just dont understand why. What do you want from me? Why are you doing this?"
0,154,18,FIFTH,Because I love you.
0,154,19,TEAL'C,What is it?
0,154,19,THOR,"I am unsure. It seems ONeills mind is building something, virtually, in conjunction with the ships computer. I do not know how much longer his life can be sustained."
0,154,19,DANIEL,"Jack, can you hear me?"
0,154,19,THOR,I must revive him now.
0,154,19,ONEILLS VOICE,Wait! Not yet!
0,154,19,O'NEILL,Oy! What a headache!
0,154,19,DANIEL,Take it easy. Youve been through a lot.
0,154,20,O'NEILL,What now?!
0,154,20,DANIEL,"Er, whats the last thing you remember?"
0,154,20,O'NEILL,Getting my head sucked by one of those damned Ancient head-suckers. And something about twins. Tealc  whats with the hair?
0,154,20,THOR,ONeill.
0,154,20,O'NEILL,Thor. You got aspirin?
0,154,20,THOR,You should feel better momentarily and your memory will slowly return.
0,154,21,O'NEILL,Tealc  whats with the hair?
0,154,21,THOR,The specifications for the device you created remain in the computer. I believe I can synthesise it.
0,154,22,O'NEILL,Sweet. What is it?
0,154,22,DANIEL,"We dont know, but you made it."
0,154,22,O'NEILL,No.
0,154,22,DANIEL,Yes.
0,154,22,O'NEILL,No.
0,154,22,DANIEL,Yes.
0,154,22,O'NEILL,No.
0,154,22,DANIEL,Yes.
0,154,22,THOR,You accessed the Ancient knowledge in your mind and instructed the ships computer to design it.
0,154,22,O'NEILL,Doesnt mean I know what it is.
0,154,22,THOR,It was doubtful at best that he would remember. The knowledge of the Ancients is gone.
0,154,22,O'NEILL,"Alright, let me have a look. Ah, got legs. Ive got it, Ive got it. Yeah. I got nothing."
0,154,23,THOR,"Penegal, I am relieved you are still able to communicate."
0,154,23,PENEGAL,It may not last long. Were you able to procure a means of fighting the Replicators?
0,154,23,THOR,Possibly. It still requires more research.
0,154,23,PENEGAL,You should know those infesting the colony are behaving in an organised fashion unlike any Replicators we have encountered before.
0,154,23,THOR,Perhaps they are being controlled by a human-form leader who has yet to reveal itself.
0,154,23,DANIEL,"If a human-form Replicator survived, its possible Sam survived too, isnt it?"
0,154,23,THOR,It is also possible the old-version Replicators created a new human form to lead them as before.
0,154,23,DANIEL,"Yeah, but theres a chance. Can you scan the planet for life signs?"
0,154,23,PENEGAL,We already have. There are none.
0,154,23,THOR,"Penegal, can you hear me? We have lost contact."
0,154,23,CARTER,Did you really think you could convince me that this illusion was my life? That I would just accept it?
0,154,23,FIFTH,If it was something you wanted badly enough in your mind.
0,154,23,CARTER,Is that why you tortured me for so long? So I would want this as an alternative?
0,154,23,FIFTH,"No, I tortured you because I was mad. Why do you think I hated you so much for what you did to me? From the first moment we met, when you let me inside your mind, I saw you like no-one else ever could."
0,154,23,CARTER,Human emotions can be very overwhelming. The fact that you feel anything at all is a miracle. It makes you very special.
0,154,23,FIFTH,Im glad you see that.
0,154,23,CARTER,"No, you dont understand. I could never be happy this way."
0,154,23,FIFTH,Then you will be unhappy for a very long time.
0,154,25,AMATERASU,Make sure Camulus knows he will forever be branded a traitor and a coward.
0,154,26,THOR,Most intriguing.
0,154,26,DANIEL,Can you make it work?
0,154,26,THOR,"To be honest, I am still unsure of exactly what *it* is."
0,154,27,O'NEILL,Dont look at me.
0,154,27,AEGIR,"Thor, this is Commander Aegir of the Valhalla. We have lost contact with the colony."
0,154,27,THOR,"Aegir, communications are down. What have you to report?"
0,154,27,AEGIR,"We have located what appears to be the remains of a human-form Replicator floating in space. It obviously survived the destruction of its ship. By all appearances, it is currently inactive."
0,154,27,THOR,Transmit co-ordinates.
0,154,27,AEGIR,"Use caution, Thor."
0,154,27,DANIEL,What are you gonna do?
0,154,27,O'NEILL,Where are you goin?
0,154,27,THOR,I am going to transport it aboard.
0,154,27,O'NEILL,Why?
0,154,27,THOR,We must learn the location of the human form controlling the Replicators on the planet.
0,154,28,DANIEL,Anybody recognise him?
0,154,28,TEAL'C,No.
0,154,28,O'NEILL,Is it dead?
0,154,28,THOR,"Hopefully not completely. All Replicators are linked by a sophisticated communication system. If we can use this one to tap into the network, we will be able to see what any of the Replicators can see."
0,154,28,O'NEILL,"And if he wakes up, this pod gonna hold him?"
0,154,28,THOR,Probably not.
0,154,28,O'NEILL,Then perhaps there is no great wisdom in this.
0,154,28,THOR,"I will transport it back into space if necessary, but we must take the risk."
0,154,29,O'NEILL,Good.
0,154,29,DANIEL,Whats that?
0,154,29,THOR,Replicator communication data. I am searching for any references to other human forms.
0,154,29,CARTER,You cant just keep me here forever.
0,154,29,FIFTH,Yes I can.
0,154,29,CARTER,"No matter what you do, I will never, ever participate in this fantasy. What?"
0,154,30,O'NEILL,Zoom in!
0,154,30,DANIEL,Thats Sam.
0,154,30,O'NEILL,Can you pinpoint her location?
0,154,30,THOR,"She is in a small Replicator structure on the planet. It is some distance outside the colony, near a rich vein of neutronium."
0,154,30,TEAL'C,They must be using it to create more human Replicators.
0,154,30,DANIEL,I thought the ship was destroyed.
0,154,30,THOR,At least one of the human Replicators must have separated from the main ship with Major Carter prior to exiting hyperspace.
0,154,31,O'NEILL,Beam it out!
0,154,31,THOR,I am trying. It has made itself resistant. It has breached the internal barrier and interfaced with my ships computer.
0,154,32,O'NEILL,Had to do *somethin*.
0,154,32,THOR,"It seems to have permanently disrupted communication between the individual cells, rendering each one inert. We explored such a technology in the past with no success."
0,154,32,O'NEILL,"Great. I mean, we can use this thing to whack the rest of those bugs?"
0,154,32,THOR,"Even better, ONeill. Now that I have seen what the device does, I may be able to modify a larger version to broadcast a disruption wave over all of Orilla."
0,154,32,O'NEILL,"Well, good. While youre doing that"
0,154,32,THOR,I cannot transport you inside the Replicator ship on the planet. Their defences prevent it. But I can get you close.
0,154,32,O'NEILL,Close is good.
0,154,32,THOR,"Take this, so we may communicate."
0,154,33,O'NEILL,Whos your daddy?!
0,154,33,FIFTH,"Stop! If you harm me or any more of my brethren, I assure you Major Carter will die instantly."
0,154,35,THOR,ONeill. I have successfully modified my ship to emit a massive disruption wave.
0,154,36,O'NEILL,Excellent! I knew you could do it.
0,154,36,THOR,"It is fifty percent charged. If this works, you will have saved the Asgard once again."
0,154,36,O'NEILL,"Im real happy for you. Im extremely proud, but we got a little bit of a problem down here. Fifth detected our approach and he claims he can kill Carter instantly."
0,154,36,THOR,ONeill ...
0,154,36,O'NEILL,"Hey, I know what youre gonna say. Her life was already sacrificed, and youve got your whole planet to worry about. But Ive got problems too."
0,154,37,DANIEL,Jack ...
0,154,37,O'NEILL,Hang on a second. What?
0,154,38,DANIEL,This could be very bad.
0,154,38,O'NEILL,"What are they doing? Its like theyre running away. Thor, are you ready yet?"
0,154,38,THOR,"What is happening, ONeill?"
0,154,38,O'NEILL,Theyre retreating!
0,154,38,THOR,"You must stop them, ONeill. The weapon is not yet ready. They cannot be allowed to escape."
0,154,38,O'NEILL,Come on.
0,154,39,CARTER,"I know you can hear me! Whats happening? Fifth, where are you?!"
0,154,40,FIFTH,We must leave.
0,154,40,CARTER,Why?
0,154,40,FIFTH,Theyve found a means to fight us.
0,154,40,CARTER,The Asgard? How?
0,154,40,FIFTH,The one you call ONeill.
0,154,40,CARTER,What?!
0,154,40,FIFTH,So many of us are left in the city. We cannot wait for them. They will be killed.
0,154,40,CARTER,Dont expect me to be sorry.
0,154,40,FIFTH,Your friends. They are killing ...
0,154,41,FIFTH,... trying to stop us.
0,154,41,CARTER,Trying to save me.
0,154,41,FIFTH,No. They do not care about you. I told them I would kill you if they did not stop.
0,154,42,CARTER,Then why dont you kill me? You know why my friends wont stop just to save me?
0,154,42,FIFTH,No.
0,154,42,CARTER,"Because they know, when it comes right down to it, I would rather be dead than be trapped like this forever. No matter what you feel for me, I will *never* love you back. Kill me if you want, but if you have even one shred of humanity in you, if you really truly love me, youll let me go."
0,154,44,THOR,"ONeill, the weapon worked. Reports from the colony say all the remaining Replicators have been neutralised. While the ship did escape, at least we have an effective means of fighting them now."
0,154,44,O'NEILL,"Yeah, well, at least theres that."
0,154,44,THOR,ONeill  I am detecting a fourth lifesign in your immediate vicinity.
0,154,45,DANIEL,Sam! Sam!
0,154,45,O'NEILL,Carter!
0,154,45,TEAL'C,ONeill!
0,154,45,O'NEILL,You OK?
0,154,45,CARTER,"Glad to see you, sir."
0,154,45,O'NEILL,Likewise.
0,154,46,WEIR,"Colonel, come in. How are you feeling?"
0,154,46,O'NEILL,Not bad. Havent had the urge to go anywhere or build anything lately.
0,154,46,WEIR,"Well, you have been given a clean bill of health as far as the finest medical professionals on *this* planet are concerned."
0,154,46,O'NEILL,"Well, what do they know?!"
0,154,46,WEIR,The President asked me to extend an invitation to you. Dinner at the White House.
0,154,46,O'NEILL,Do you know what theyre having?
0,154,46,WEIR,I dont think Ive had the chance to personally thank you yet.
0,154,46,O'NEILL,For what?
0,154,46,WEIR,"You risk your life over and over, and ask for nothing in return."
0,154,46,O'NEILL,"Well, dont be fooled. Im makin a list."
0,154,46,WEIR,Well I doubt very much theres anything that could properly repay you.
0,154,46,O'NEILL,Are you goin somewhere?
0,154,46,WEIR,"As a matter of fact, the President has asked me to supervise the research of the Ancient outpost. Its gonna be a bit of a delicate situation, given all the various international claims already being made on the site."
0,154,46,O'NEILL,Sounds right up your alley.
0,154,46,WEIR,"Yeah, well, much more so than this job."
0,154,46,O'NEILL,Does that mean Hammond will be coming back?
0,154,46,WEIR,"No. General Hammond is being promoted. Hell be overseeing all things relating to Earths defence on behalf of the Pentagon and Washington  the SGC, the 303 programme, the Antarctic site. Unofficially its being called Homeworld Security."
0,154,46,O'NEILL,Any idea who were gonna be stuck with?
0,154,46,WEIR,"The Pentagon has convinced the President that there is one man who could run the SGC and make it politically viable from an international perspective, despite the fact that he is part of the American military establishment."
0,154,46,O'NEILL,Do we *know* this ... shrub?
0,154,46,WEIR,"Well, *you* know him rather well ... Brigadier General Jack ONeill."
0,154,46,O'NEILL,Me?!
0,154,46,WEIR,"Yeah, you."
0,154,46,O'NEILL,Brigadier ... Its on my list.
0,154,46,WEIR,Congratulations.
0,154,46,O'NEILL,"I should be clear  Id like the promotion, pay cheque and the parking spot. But I dont really wanna be in charge of anything. No."
0,154,46,WEIR,"Well, sadly, all those things kind of go together. So I guess you have some thinking to do."
0,154,46,O'NEILL,I *hate* that.
0,154,47,DANIEL,Maybe you should break it down into the pros and the cons.
0,154,47,O'NEILL,"Ive spent my whole life sticking it to the man. If I do this, Ill *be* the man. I dont think I can be the man."
0,154,47,CARTER,Youll be inheriting a pretty big can of worms with the state of affairs out there.
0,154,47,TEAL'C,"If Baal truly is on the verge of dominance of the System Lords, we face a formidable challenge ahead."
0,154,47,CARTER,Plus who knows where and when Fifth and the other Replicators will turn up.
0,154,47,DANIEL,Here on Earth weve never been under so much scrutiny as we will be be now that so many governments know about the Stargate.
0,154,47,O'NEILL,Ive never had a desk.
0,154,47,DANIEL,"Thats, a, uh ..."
0,154,47,ONEILL,Con. DANIEL. Con.
0,154,47,CARTER,"For the record, sir, you *do* have a desk."
0,154,48,O'NEILL,I do?
0,154,48,DANIEL,"On the flip side of the coin, theres the fact that nobody knows how this place should be run better than you."
0,154,48,O'NEILL,"Why thank you, Daniel."
0,154,48,DANIEL,"With a little guidance from your good friends and advisors, of course."
0,154,48,CARTER,"If you dont take the job, we could end up with someone much worse. OK, that didnt come out right."
0,154,48,TEAL'C,
0,154,48,O'NEILL,"Yeah, now, see, Im not sure Im ready to give that up either  sitting back watching you guys go off and have all the fun."
0,154,48,DANIEL,Risking our lives in the face of grave danger ...
0,154,48,ONEILL,"Yeah, that."
0,154,48,CARTER,"Well, Im sure therell be situations in which you can accompany us in the field, sir."
0,154,48,DANIEL,Youll be in charge  you can do whatever you want.
0,154,48,O'NEILL,Ill be able to do whatever I want.
0,154,49,CARTER,"Within reason, sir."
0,154,50,WEIR,"Although my time here has been brief, it has been without a doubt indelible. I will remember every one of you, and I thank you all for your hard work. Im not one for long goodbyes, so without further ado it is with great pleasure I introduce you to your new commanding officer, Brigadier General Jack ONeill."
0,154,51,O'NEILL,"At ease. You all know how much I *love* speeches, so Ill make this short. I wish I could say I didnt owe anything to anyone, but the truth is I wouldnt be standing here if it wasnt for the courage and support of each and every one of you. I hope I can be as good a leader as weve had in the past, and as good as you deserve."
0,154,51,DANIEL,"Hear, hear!"
0,154,51,O'NEILL,The other reason I took this job was so I could do really cool stuff like this: it is with great pride that my first order of business as commander of this base is the announcement of the promotion of Major Samantha Carter to Lieutenant Colonel.
0,154,53,DAVIS,"The President of the United States has placed special trust and confidence in the patriotism, integrity and abilities of Major Samantha Carter. Major Samantha Carter is promoted to the grade of Lieutenant Colonel, United States Air Force."
0,154,54,O'NEILL,"Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter. Now, raise your right hand and repeat after me: I, insert name."
0,154,54,CARTER,
0,154,55,FIFTH,"Dont be afraid. I know the first moment of consciousness can be frightening. I will show you everything, share with you all I know. You have no idea how happy I am we were able to collect enough neutronium."
0,154,56,FIFTH,"We have much time to share. We must search for a new home for our brethren to propagate. It will pass quickly for us, though. Soon enough, *everyone* will know. Together, we *cannot* be stopped."
