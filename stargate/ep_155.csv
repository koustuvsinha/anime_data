0,155,0,"""LOCKDOWN""",By Joseph Mallozzi & Paul Mullie Transcribed by
0,155,2,DANIEL,Whats going on?
0,155,2,CARTER,Its our Russian team on the International Space Station. Theyre adjusting the orbit to avoid some debris left over from our ... little incident in Antarctica.
0,155,4,TECHNICIAN,It worked.
0,155,4,DANIEL,"He said, If the Americans wanna keep blasting alien ships out of orbit, theyve gotta do a better job of tracking their own mess."
0,155,5,CARTER,Whats going on?
0,155,5,TECHNICIAN,I dont know. We lost contact.
0,155,6,O'NEILL,Come in.
0,155,6,VASELOV,"General ONeill. It is an honour to meet you, and may I say an even greater honour to finally serve under your command."
0,155,6,O'NEILL,Wow. That was a load. Who are you?
0,155,6,VASELOV,"I am Colonel Alexi Vaselov, sir. I assumed you were expecting my arrival."
0,155,6,O'NEILL,"Uh, yeah. Sure. Umm ... yeah, heres the memo. Right there."
0,155,6,VASELOV,"I want you to know, sir, that I personally requested this transfer. After my many years of service with Russian Air Force, I feel confident that I can make a positive contribution to Stargate Command."
0,155,6,O'NEILL,Great!
0,155,6,VASELOV,"If I may be so bold, sir, I understand that with your recent appointment as base commander, a position has become available on SG-1. I would of course relish the opportunity to serve on the SGCs elite team."
0,155,6,O'NEILL,"Yes. You and everyone else on this base. Colonel, not gonna happen."
0,155,6,VASELOV,"I understand your reluctance, sir. If you look at my record, I think it will satisfy any of your concerns. I have over three thousand flight hours on more than thirty-five types of aircraft and prototypes. In addition, I have been awarded the High Order of Russia, the Gold Star, the ..."
0,155,6,O'NEILL,"Yes, thats very impressive. Very. But its not gonna get you on SG-1."
0,155,6,VASELOV,Understood. I am of course willing to accept a position on a different team.
0,155,6,O'NEILL,"Colonel, until you go through the proper training, youre not going anywhere near that Gate."
0,155,6,VASELOV,"Perhaps I could assume a role as a non-combat observer on one of the exploration units, sir."
0,155,6,O'NEILL,It was nice meeting you. Very nice. Youre dismissed.
0,155,8,TEAL'C,"If all goes to plan, barring any unforeseen circumstance, I will acquire possession of my apartment on Tuesday."
0,155,8,CARTER,"Hey, congratulations!"
0,155,8,DANIEL,"So whens the apartment-warming party? Uh, when someone gets a new place its customary for them to throw a party."
0,155,8,TEAL'C,Would I be required to prepare a meal?
0,155,8,CARTER,"No, make it pot-luck. Well all bring something."
0,155,8,TEAL'C,Very well. Next Saturday.
0,155,8,O'NEILL,"Im only gonna say this once, Carter. At ease."
0,155,9,DANIEL,So hows the new job?
0,155,9,O'NEILL,Oy! One crisis after another. This morning the Mess got a shipment of Yukon Gold potatoes instead of the usual Russets.
0,155,9,DANIEL,No!
0,155,9,O'NEILL,Oh yes! The Golds dont make for good mash. Consistencys all wrong.
0,155,10,CARTER,I hear the new Russian colonel came to see you  made a pitch to join SG-1.
0,155,10,O'NEILL,Yeah.
0,155,10,DANIEL,Whatd you say?
0,155,10,O'NEILL,Told em to make French fries instead.
0,155,10,DANIEL,About the Russian.
0,155,10,O'NEILL,"Oh. Well I made it clear he shouldnt expect preferential treatment, that hed have to prove himself before Id consider him for offworld travel."
0,155,10,CARTER,"He is one of the most highly decorated officers in Russian military history, and he has over twenty years flight experience."
0,155,10,O'NEILL,And exactly no years in offworld travel. Im not gonna risk the lives of anyone under my command on a slick résumé.
0,155,10,CARTER,"How ... uncharacteristically cautious of you, sir."
0,155,10,O'NEILL,Yes  theres that.
0,155,10,DANIEL,And theres also the fact that the Russians must be pressuring you to put em on the team.
0,155,10,O'NEILL,Yes  theres that too.
0,155,10,DANIEL,You cant exactly blame them  we havent been making good on our promises.
0,155,10,O'NEILL,We gave them their own team!
0,155,10,DANIEL,That was two years ago  what have we done for them lately?
0,155,10,O'NEILL,Forget it! Im not putting him on SG-1.
0,155,10,TEAL'C,"Do you have someone else in mind for the position, ONeill?"
0,155,10,O'NEILL,No.
0,155,10,DANIEL,So were sticking with the three-man team?
0,155,10,O'NEILL,Why not? Its one less decision I have to deal with.
0,155,10,CARTER,Theres nothing in the regulations that says an SG team has to be made up of four people.
0,155,10,O'NEILL,There you go. Problem solved.
0,155,10,O'NEILL,Thank you.
0,155,11,DANIEL,Colonel Vaselov.
0,155,11,VASELOV,Doctor Jackson. Of course. Come in. . Your reputation precedes you. Im well acquainted with your work.
0,155,11,DANIEL,I just wanted to come by and welcome you to the neighbourhood.
0,155,11,VASELOV,Thats very kind of you. I only wish others were as open to my presence here.
0,155,11,DANIEL,"Yeah, dont take General ONeills decision personally."
0,155,11,VASELOV,Its difficult not to. Frankly his attitude is offensive. It leads me to wonder he if knows the Cold War is over.
0,155,11,DANIEL,Yeah  his attitude has nothing to do with your being Russian. Hes an equal opportunity offender.
0,155,11,VASELOV,And I am supposed to find this comforting?
0,155,11,DANIEL,"Uh, he doesnt respond well to outside pressure."
0,155,11,VASELOV,Our nations are supposed to be partners in the Stargate programme.
0,155,11,DANIEL,"Yes, Im well aware of the deal, Colonel, I helped broker it."
0,155,11,VASELOV,Well then you more than anyone can understand our frustration.
0,155,11,DANIEL,"Okay, what you have to realise is, um, Colonel ONeill ... General ONeill just assumed command of this facility and, uh, and hes got a lot on his plate. Quite frankly, making demands on him right now is just bad timing on the part of your government. Colonel? Colonel?"
0,155,13,BRIGHTMAN,What happened?
0,155,13,DANIEL,I dunno. We were just talking and all of a sudden he just collapsed.
0,155,13,BRIGHTMAN,Alright. I know youre scheduled to go offworld. Well take care of him.
0,155,15,O'NEILL,Hows he doin?
0,155,15,BRIGHTMAN,Confused. Apparently the last thing he remembers is being in Russia. He doesnt know where he is or how he got here. Hes also exhibiting certain physical symptoms which have me concerned. He has lesions over forty percent of his body and a highly elevated white blood count which indicates some sort of infection.
0,155,15,O'NEILL,Is he contagious?
0,155,15,BRIGHTMAN,"Its a distinct possibility. Sir, we need to examine everyone whos been in contact with this man."
0,155,16,O'NEILL,Daniel! Report back to the Infirmary.
0,155,17,DANIEL,"Open the Gate! Do it, now!"
0,155,18,DANIEL!,
0,155,19,BRIGHTMAN,Hes lost a lot of blood but his life is no longer in any immediate danger.
0,155,19,CARTER,"The members of SG-11 insisted he seemed perfectly normal. Did you notice anything peculiar about him, sir?"
0,155,19,O'NEILL,I thought it odd he was shooting up the Gateroom.
0,155,19,TEAL'C,He reacted immediately after the Gate was shut down.
0,155,19,BRIGHTMAN,Why was he so desperate to go through?
0,155,19,CARTER,Does he have any of Colonel Vaselovs symptoms?
0,155,19,BRIGHTMAN,"No lesions yet, but that may just be a matter of time. He does have an elevated white blood count."
0,155,19,TEAL'C,Yet Colonel Vaselov displayed no unusual behaviour.
0,155,19,BRIGHTMAN,"That doesnt necessarily mean theyre not something from the same condition. If an infection reaches the brain, it can manifest itself in a variety of ways, from memory loss to full-blown psychosis."
0,155,19,O'NEILL,You dont think its a coincidence?
0,155,19,BRIGHTMAN,"Seems unlikely, sir. I think theres a high probability that we have a contagion on the base."
0,155,20,O'NEILL,"Contact all teams that are offworld. Tell them that the SGC is off limits. Have them proceed to the Alpha site til further notice. Effective immediately, the SGC is under lockdown."
0,155,22,CARTER,Hi. Hows Daniel?
0,155,22,BRIGHTMAN,Hes still unconscious but hes improving. Hes responding well to treatment and his white cell count is coming down.
0,155,22,CARTER,What about Colonel Vaselov?
0,155,22,BRIGHTMAN,Its not so good. Were treating him with antibiotics but his condition is deteriorating. Until we know more about the source of the infection theres not much else we can do.
0,155,22,CARTER,"Well, since it started with Vaselov we can be pretty sure it didnt come through the Gate."
0,155,22,BRIGHTMAN,Im waiting to hear back from the Russians about possible sources of the infection from their end.
0,155,22,CARTER,Anyone else showing symptoms?
0,155,22,BRIGHTMAN,Not yet.
0,155,23,VASELOV,How is he? Doctor Jackson. Doctor Brightman told me what happened.
0,155,23,TEAL'C,His condition is improving.
0,155,23,VASELOV,Good.
0,155,23,TEAL'C,And your condition?
0,155,23,VASELOV,"Not so good. But not so bad as the time I went drinking with General Darshkevich in Novgorod. That was worse headache. Doctor Jackson is good friend of yours, yes?"
0,155,23,TEAL'C,"Indeed he is. Despite what you are thinking, you bear no responsibility for what has transpired."
0,155,23,VASELOV,My presence here has resulted in the quarantine of this entire complex.
0,155,23,TEAL'C,"Had you remained in your homeland, you would have faced a similar situation, only in a different setting  again, through no fault of your own."
0,155,23,VASELOV,Perhaps. But at the moment I cant be sure of anything.
0,155,23,TEAL'C,Has your memory not yet returned?
0,155,23,VASELOV,"In my dreams I have begun to see flashes  glimpses of these past few days: walking these halls, talking to people  and yet its as if I am not even here. Im just a helpless observer inside my own body."
0,155,24,BRIGHTMAN,One month ago Anatole Konstantinov fell ill after completing a tour on the International Space Station.
0,155,24,CARTER,I remember. We monitored the mission. We lost contact for almost thirty seconds and we never figured out why.
0,155,24,BRIGHTMAN,"Well, I dont know if theyre connected but he died less than a week later in a Moscow hospital. Now, officially the cause of death was renal failure but unofficially the Russian authorities havent a clue what killed him."
0,155,24,CARTER,You think it might be our mystery disease?
0,155,24,BRIGHTMAN,"Among the symptoms he exhibited were memory loss, skin lesions and a highly elevated white blood count."
0,155,24,TEAL'C,Is there any connection to Colonel Vaselov?
0,155,24,BRIGHTMAN,Apparently Vaselov visited Konstantinov in the hospital just before he died. They were old friends  they served together in the Russian Air Force.
0,155,24,CARTER,Why didnt they tell us this?
0,155,24,BRIGHTMAN,The Russians determined that Konstantinovs condition wasnt contagious. He came into contact with many people between the time he returned to Earth and the time he checked into the hospital but no-one else ever showed any signs of being infected.
0,155,24,CARTER,Makes it an oddly selective disease.
0,155,24,TEAL'C,"Perhaps we are not dealing with a disease at all. Colonel Vaselov possessed only vague random memories of his time at Stargate Command, and yet the instances he could recall he described himself as a mere observer to the actions of his body."
0,155,24,BRIGHTMAN,Like being host to a symbiont.
0,155,24,CARTER,"Yeah, but tests ruled out the possibility of a Goauld."
0,155,24,BRIGHTMAN,Could we be looking at some other form of alien possession?
0,155,24,CARTER,"Yeah, its possible  an entity capable of moving from individual to individual. Might explain some of the inconsistencies."
0,155,24,BRIGHTMAN,"If thats true, it could be in anyone right now. Hello? ... Ill be right there. Daniels awake."
0,155,25,DANIEL,Will someone please tell me what the hell is going on?!
0,155,25,BRIGHTMAN,Youre recovering from a gunshot wound.
0,155,25,DANIEL,What?!
0,155,25,TEAL'C,You have no recollection of the incident?
0,155,25,DANIEL,No! Who shot me?
0,155,25,O'NEILL,Dont ... change the subject. What do you remember?
0,155,25,DANIEL,"Uh, I went to see Colonel Vaselov and right in the middle of our conversation he collapsed and I went to help him and ... thats it."
0,155,25,CARTER,You dont remember accompanying him to the Infirmary?
0,155,25,DANIEL,No! ... Who shot me?
0,155,26,O'NEILL,You were shooting up the Gateroom.
0,155,26,CARTER,"You wounded two guards. We think we may be dealing with a Foothold situation, specifically an alien entity capable of taking over human hosts, not unlike the Goauld, and it seems to be able to travel from person to person."
0,155,26,TEAL'C,Although at present we have no knowledge of how this is possible.
0,155,27,CARTER,Daniel?
0,155,27,DANIEL,Anubis!
0,155,27,TEAL'C,Daniel Jackson.
0,155,27,DANIEL,"It was Anubis  or rather, Anubis was controlling me."
0,155,27,O'NEILL,Anubis is dead.
0,155,27,DANIEL,No hes not  and hes here on the base.
0,155,28,O'NEILL,Youd think that getting blasted outta orbit woulda slowed the guy down.
0,155,28,TEAL'C,"According to Daniel Jackson, Anubis surrendered his mortal form when he was ascended, only to be cast down by the Ancients. As a result he exists purely as an immaterial being."
0,155,28,CARTER,"See, in the past when we encountered Anubis, the physical form we were seeing was actually a forceshield designed to contain his essence. When it was destroyed, that essence was released."
0,155,28,TEAL'C,"Anubis was trapped in Earths orbit, inhabiting debris from his ship, millions of light years away from his power base."
0,155,28,O'NEILL,So he hitched a ride on a cosmonaut?
0,155,28,CARTER,"Yes, sir, and then abandoned him for Colonel Vaselov."
0,155,28,TEAL'C,No doubt attempting to escape through our Gate.
0,155,28,O'NEILL,"Why doesnt he just use his ... freaky, super-cosmic powers and just ... ... go?"
0,155,28,TEAL'C,Doing so would alert the Ancients and only serve to bring down their wrath upon him.
0,155,28,CARTER,"See, in order to interact with the physical world, he has to get himself a new shield, but he cant do that here on Earth. Hell need a body to dial the Gate and get through."
0,155,28,TEAL'C,"Eventually, Anubis will attempt escape again."
0,155,28,O'NEILL,"Well, hes on the base, obviously not going anywhere. Tell me theres something we can do."
0,155,28,CARTER,"Well, as a matter of fact, sir, I think there is."
0,155,29,DANIEL,Whats going on?
0,155,29,CARTER,General ONeill has ordered compulsory physicals for all the SGC personnel. Were operating under the assumption that retaining Anubis essence exacts a physical toll on the carrier. You were only exposed for a couple of hours but your body reacted as though you were fighting off an infection.
0,155,29,DANIEL,So whoevers retaining his essence should start showing symptoms.
0,155,29,CARTER,"Yeah, thats the theory."
0,155,29,DANIEL,What about Vaselov?
0,155,29,CARTER,"Well, his is a more extreme case. He was exposed for over a week, thats why his symptoms are more advanced."
0,155,29,DANIEL,You mean with the lesions and the ...
0,155,29,CARTER,"Yeah, its actually more than that. His entire immune system was affected."
0,155,29,DANIEL,"But Anubis is out of him  he should start getting better, right? Sam?"
0,155,29,CARTER,Doctor Brightman says hes not responding. She thinks the exposure may have simply gone on for too long. The damage is done.
0,155,29,DANIEL,"Oh, there has to be something we can do for him."
0,155,29,CARTER,"We can help him manage the pain, thats about it."
0,155,31,O'NEILL,"I said the situation was contained  I did not say it was resolved. ... No, I cant do that. Command will stay under lockdown until I decide otherwise. Yes, sir, it is my call. ... Yes, sir. Pentagon. Getting a little antsy."
0,155,31,BRIGHTMAN,Theyre not the only ones. We got a bunch of very anxious people out there.
0,155,31,O'NEILL,"Yeah, Ill bet. What can I do for you, Doctor?"
0,155,31,BRIGHTMAN,"Its concerning Colonel Vaselov. His condition hasnt improved and hes not responding to treatment. Unless circumstances change, Id give him a week, two weeks tops."
0,155,31,O'NEILL,Ill inform the Russians.
0,155,31,BRIGHTMAN,"Thank you, sir."
0,155,32,VASELOV,Doctor Jackson?
0,155,32,DANIEL,"Oh, Alexi, sorry, I didnt mean to disturb you."
0,155,32,VASELOV,"No, no, Im glad to see you are up and about. Are you being discharged?"
0,155,32,DANIEL,Yeah  Doctor Brightman caught me stealing jello from the other patients tray so she kicked me outta here.
0,155,33,VASELOV,"Doctor, I wonder if you could do me a favour. I have a sister in Briansk. When the lockdown has ended, could you see that she gets this?"
0,155,33,DANIEL,Alexi ...
0,155,33,VASELOV,"The nurses have been careful not to say anything. That is always a bad sign. Please. Da. You know, in Russia, we have a saying: The cord may coil long, but an end will appear. That holds true for everything in this world, myself included. I accept this."
0,155,33,DANIEL,
0,155,33,VASELOV,"In the kingdom of hope, there is no winter."
0,155,33,DANIEL,I prefer that one.
0,155,33,VASELOV,"Da, its a nice saying."
0,155,33,DANIEL,"Ill come see ya. (He smiles, and puts the envelope back on the trolley before turning to walk away. Then he stops as he gets another flashback. He is lying on a gurney as hes being wheeled from the Gateroom. Doctor Brightman and a female nurse, Lieutenant Evans, are walking either side of the gurney, looking down at him."
0,155,33,EVANS,His pulse is weak.
0,155,33,BRIGHTMAN,"Hes lost a lot of blood. Doctor Jackson, can you hear me?"
0,155,35,VASELOV,Doctor Jackson?
0,155,35,DANIEL,Lieutenant Evans. Hes in Lieutenant Evans.
0,155,37,EVANS,I was examined by Doctor Brightman a couple of hours ago. She said I was fine.
0,155,37,CARTER,Its possible you havent started manifesting signs yet.
0,155,38,EVANS,"Colonel, I would know. If something like that happened to me, I would know. Im not lying."
0,155,38,CARTER,"Lieutenant, tell me what you did Tuesday afternoon."
0,155,38,EVANS,I dont understand.
0,155,38,CARTER,Just tell me. Lieutenant?
0,155,38,EVANS,I dont know.
0,155,38,CARTER,You dont know.
0,155,38,EVANS,I cant remember.
0,155,38,TEAL'C,ONeill. I have been informed that Airman Malcolm McCaffrey has missed a scheduled appointment at the Infirmary. He remains unaccounted for.
0,155,39,O'NEILL,Carter.
0,155,41,KEARNEY,General ONeill.
0,155,41,O'NEILL,"Yeah. ONeill here, go."
0,155,41,KEARNEY,"This is Major Kearney. Ive got a wounded man here claims he was jumped by Airman McCaffrey. We think hes headed for the Control Room. Advise caution, General  target is armed."
0,155,41,O'NEILL,On our way.
0,155,42,MCCAFFREY,Dial the Gate.
0,155,43,DANIEL,Mind if I come in?
0,155,43,O'NEILL,Youre not supposed to be walking around.
0,155,43,DANIEL,Its my arm.
0,155,43,O'NEILL,You were shot.
0,155,43,DANIEL,I know  you shot me.
0,155,43,O'NEILL,Not the point.
0,155,43,DANIEL,"Look, I heard what happened. Anubis is still here."
0,155,43,O'NEILL,"Daniel, he can pass through walls. Hes welcome to leave the base at any time."
0,155,43,DANIEL,"He has to go through the Stargate, otherwise hes trapped on Earth."
0,155,43,O'NEILL,"Yeah. Well, theres not much we can do. Cant kill him."
0,155,43,DANIEL,No.
0,155,43,O'NEILL,Cant catch him.
0,155,43,DANIEL,No.
0,155,43,O'NEILL,So ...
0,155,43,DANIEL,We let the Ancients deal with him.
0,155,43,O'NEILL,Yes  because theyve always been so helpful.
0,155,43,DANIEL,"If he uses his powers as an Ascended being, hes breaking the rules. They will take action. We just have to, uh, take away his other options."
0,155,43,O'NEILL,Uh-huh. I assume you have a plan?
0,155,44,DANIEL,Anubis has now made two attempts to get through the Gate. Now in both instances we were able to stop him but theres no guarantee well be so lucky the next time. We have to take steps to make it as difficult as possible for him to access the Stargate.
0,155,44,CARTER,"To that end, were proposing a division of the facility into three separate sections designated Zones 1, 2 and 3. Power to the Gate has been shut off and will no longer be accessible from the Control Room. Instead, it can now only be re-established from a relay centre located here in Zone 1. The Control Room, Gateroom and surrounding areas have been designated Zone 2. Intermediate corridors linking the two zones will be sealed. Corridors linking directly to the Gateroom will also be sealed. The only means of unsealing these corridors will be from a Security Control Centre located here in the section designated Zone 3."
0,155,44,DANIEL,"All personnel will be restricted to one of these three zones. Standing food and medical supplies will be divided amongst the three sections. Doctor Brightmans team will be split into three units and continue monitoring personnel through daily physical examinations. Now no-one, not even General ONeill, will be permitted access to a neighbouring zone until lockdown ends."
0,155,44,CARTER,Any questions so far?
0,155,44,KEARNEY,"With all due respect, Colonel, given everything we know about Anubis, do you really think this is going to stop him?"
0,155,45,DANIEL,"The point is to make it impossible for him to get through the Gate in the body of any one person. Now, when he realises he cant get out that way, hell have no choice but to risk revealing himself to the Ancients."
0,155,46,SILER,Zone 1 secure.
0,155,46,CARTER,Zone 3 secured.
0,155,46,O'NEILL,Zone 2 secure. Good luck.
0,155,51,O'NEILL,"ONeill. ... Yes, Mr President. ... Y-Yes, sir, its six days without incident. ... Yes, all SG personnel present and accounted for. ... No, no-one has shown any physical symptoms, sir, but that doesnt mean Anubis is gone. Its the President. Well, yes, sir, of course I understand the importance of the programme but I would be ... I understand, sir ... Hello? Ive got twenty-four hours to re-establish normal Gate operations."
0,155,51,TEAL'C,It was unreasonable to assume the lockdown could be maintained indefinitely.
0,155,51,O'NEILL,"Yeah, I suppose."
0,155,52,O'NEILL,"Attention all personnel. This is General ONeill. I know the current situation has been tough on all of you. Youve been cut off from your families, your homes; youre wondering how much longer this can go on. But the fact is, theres a threat on this base that cannot be allowed to escape. Knowing that, the President has authorised me to maintain this lockdown indefinitely. Weve only got food enough for another month, so well find a secure way to bring supplies down from the surface. In the meantime, I suggest you all get comfortable. Were not going anywhere."
0,155,54,CARTER,I need to run a diagnostic.
0,155,54,DANIEL,"Hey, Sam."
0,155,58,DANIEL,"Tealc, this is Daniel."
0,155,58,TEAL'C,"Proceed, Daniel Jackson."
0,155,58,DANIEL,Anubis has got Sam. Shes headed your way.
0,155,58,TEAL'C,Understood.
0,155,60,DANIEL,Jack?
0,155,60,O'NEILL,Go ahead.
0,155,60,DANIEL,Anubis tampered with the security system  he set up a sequence of timed commands. Were trying to override but were not having much luck.
0,155,60,O'NEILL,"Keep me posted. Keep an eye on em. Kearney, youre with me."
0,155,61,KEARNEY,General?
0,155,61,O'NEILL,Major.
0,155,61,KEARNEY,Sir?
0,155,61,O'NEILL,"Ready your key. Major, base security is being compromised. Ready your key. Thats an order."
0,155,62,KEARNEY,"Yes, sir."
0,155,62,O'NEILL,"Counting down  on three, two, one, turn."
0,155,64,TANNOY,Five minutes til self-destruct.
0,155,65,O'NEILL,"You did good, son."
0,155,66,TANNOY,Four minutes til self-destruct. Four minutes til self-destruct.
0,155,68,GUARD,Sir!
0,155,68,TEAL'C,Come no further.
0,155,68,CARTER,"Tealc, you have to give me access to the base computer. Someone activated the self-destruct  let me shut it down."
0,155,68,TEAL'C,You are infected.
0,155,68,CARTER,I was infected. Anubis left me for someone else.
0,155,68,TEAL'C,Of this I cannot be certain.
0,155,68,CARTER,"Tealc, Im not Anubis. Its me, Carter."
0,155,69,TANNOY,Three minutes til self-destruct.
0,155,69,CARTER,"Tealc, please."
0,155,69,TEAL'C,Very well.
0,155,69,TANNOY,Self-destruct aborted. Self-destruct aborted.
0,155,70,TEAL'C,Well done.
0,155,72,CARTER,Someones activated the Gate.
0,155,72,DANIEL,"Tealc, this is Daniel. I think Anubis is headed for the Gateroom."
0,155,72,TEAL'C,Understood.
0,155,72,CARTER,Ill see if I can override the dialling sequence.
0,155,73,TEAL'C,ONeill.
0,155,74,O'NEILL,Stand aside.
0,155,74,VASELOV,Niet. You need a body to go through the Gate. Take mine. Take mine or Ill kill us both.
0,155,76,CARTER,General.
0,155,76,O'NEILL,Im OK. Ish.
0,155,76,O'NEILL,"He got through, didn't he?"
0,155,76,CARTER,Sort of. I was able to override the established dialling sequence and input an alternate address. I sent him to KS7-535 instead.
0,155,76,O'NEILL,Chilly.
