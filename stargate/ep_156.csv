0,156,0,"""ZERO HOUR""",By Robert C. Cooper Transcribed by
0,156,1,WALTER,"Morning, sir."
0,156,1,O'NEILL,Walter.
0,156,1,WALTER,"At oh seven thirty this morning, SG-8 made scheduled contact from P6J-908. They requested permission to bring an alien lifeform back to the base for further study. Sir, its just a plant. Your oh eight thirty debriefing is SG-2 regarding their mission to P8F-809. Folders on your desk, and with the personnel files you have yet to review."
0,156,1,O'NEILL,How many do I have left?
0,156,1,WALTER,All of them.
0,156,1,O'NEILL,Right!
0,156,1,WALTER,"Colonel Rudnell has asked me to show you some bunting samples, and, um, Captain Corrigans still awaiting approval on the buffet menu."
0,156,1,O'NEILL,Bunting. John.
0,156,2,PRIOR,General.
0,156,2,O'NEILL,You are aware of the fact that this is the most secure military facility on the face of the planet.
0,156,2,PRIOR,"Well, actually, sir, there are still a number of issues to be resolved."
0,156,2,WALTER,"Ten hundred hours, sir."
0,156,2,O'NEILL,Thank you.
0,156,2,O'NEILL,Walter!
0,156,2,WALTER,"Sorry, sir. General ONeill - Mark Gilmor. Hes your new administrative aide."
0,156,2,GILMOR,General.
0,156,2,O'NEILL,Did I order a new ...
0,156,2,WALTER,"No, sir."
0,156,2,O'NEILL,Do I really need ...
0,156,2,WALTER,"Yes, sir."
0,156,2,O'NEILL,Civilian?
0,156,2,GILMOR,"Ive, uh, been an analyst at the CIA for the last eight years - mostly background checks but I did have top-level clearance."
0,156,2,WALTER,He was assigned by General Hammond.
0,156,2,O'NEILL,"Ah, well, in that case welcome aboard. How about if I give you a tour around?"
0,156,2,GILMOR,"Ah. Had one, sir."
0,156,2,O'NEILL,Damn.
0,156,2,GILMOR,Very exciting to finally see it all in action.
0,156,2,O'NEILL,Mm.
0,156,2,WALTER,"General, your oh eight thirty."
0,156,2,O'NEILL,"Yes. Youre here to assist me, right? How about if you dive into"
0,156,2,WALTER,"Sir, sir, sir, you really need to read the file yourself. Yeah. Yeah."
0,156,2,O'NEILL,"Thank you, Walter. Does Mr Gilmor have ..."
0,156,2,WALTER,Follow me.
0,156,3,GILMOR,"Well, hes not like other generals."
0,156,3,WALTER,"Actually, hes not like other ... people."
0,156,3,GILMOR,Ah. I take it Ive got some catching up to do.
0,156,3,WALTER,"Yeah, and those are just the files pertinent to todays agenda, so ..."
0,156,3,GILMOR,"Well, Id better get started."
0,156,3,WALTER,I cant tell you how happy we all are to have you here.
0,156,3,GILMOR,"Thank you, Sergeant."
0,156,3,WALTER,"Really, really happy."
0,156,3,GILMOR,"Thank you, Sergeant."
0,156,3,GILMOR,"Im in position. ... No, sir, he does not suspect a thing."
0,156,4,O'NEILL,Nothing in peridot?
0,156,4,WALTER,"Well, traditionally, sir, this type of event calls for red, white and blue."
0,156,5,GILMOR,"Scuse me, sir, General Hammond is on the phone from the Pentagon, and SG-1 is here for the thirteen hundred briefing."
0,156,5,O'NEILL,"Thank you. Walter, I just dont have the decorating gene - would you mind?"
0,156,5,WALTER,"Yes, sir."
0,156,6,O'NEILL,"Sir. ... General, how are you? ... I know, sir, but every time I open my mouth to say George, General comes out."
0,156,7,O'NEILL,Okay.
0,156,7,CARTER,General.
0,156,7,O'NEILL,Colonel! Weve all met.
0,156,7,DANIEL,"Yes, actually, we know each others life stories."
0,156,7,O'NEILL,That snippiness?
0,156,7,DANIEL,Is that a word?
0,156,7,O'NEILL,What you got?
0,156,7,DANIEL,A Gate address. A planet formerly in Anubis domain that apparently Baal hasnt discovered yet.
0,156,7,CARTER,We believe it may be home to an abandoned base.
0,156,7,O'NEILL,And just chock full of abandoned weapons?
0,156,7,DANIEL,Wouldnt you know?!
0,156,7,TEAL'C,This device was procured from Jaffa formerly loyal to Anubis. It should allow us access to the base.
0,156,8,O'NEILL,Whens the next opening?
0,156,8,GILMOR,Oh eight hundred tomorrow morning.
0,156,8,CARTER,Tomorrow?
0,156,8,O'NEILL,Ive got fourteen teams out there.
0,156,8,CARTER,Im sorry - operations protocol?
0,156,8,O'NEILL,Is it?
0,156,8,CARTER,"Sir, the MALP showed no indication of any Goauld activity."
0,156,8,O'NEILL,I still want SG-3 to cover your flanks.
0,156,8,CARTER,Its just recon.
0,156,8,O'NEILL,All the more reason you can wait another day.
0,156,9,WALTER,Incoming wormhole.
0,156,9,GILMOR,
0,156,9,O'NEILL,Oy! Love to stay and chat.
0,156,9,DANIEL,"Jack, if those rebel Jaffa know about it, its only a matter of time before Baal knows about it."
0,156,9,O'NEILL,"One day, Daniel! One day."
0,156,9,DANIEL,Theres one negotiation Im glad Im not part of.
0,156,10,O'NEILL,Its a plant.
0,156,10,LEE,Exactly. Twenty minutes ago it was a seed.
0,156,10,GILMOR,"E-excuse me, sir, if you dont mind my asking - is it really wise to be bringing alien lifeforms through the Gate?"
0,156,10,O'NEILL,Its a plant.
0,156,10,LEE,"Yeah. And besides, offworld teams follow strict safety protocols in determining what to bring back to Earth. Yknow, if humankind is gonna benefit from what we find out there, we have to be able to study it in controlled situations."
0,156,10,O'NEILL,Its a plant.
0,156,10,LEE,"I know, I-I know - and I know our mandate is to seek our new weapons and technology to defend the planet from our enemies, but wouldnt it be cool if we could exploit the wonders of the galaxy for other beneficial purposes, like curing disease or, well - in this case - possibly, solving world hunger."
0,156,10,O'NEILL,Speaking of which ...
0,156,10,LEE,Doctor Lee speaking. ... General! They want you in the Briefing Room!
0,156,11,DANIEL,"Hey! You, uh, wanna get some lunch?"
0,156,11,CARTER,"No, Im fine."
0,156,11,DANIEL,"You just gonna sit in here all day and, uh ..."
0,156,11,CARTER,Im not sulking.
0,156,11,DANIEL,Working. Gonna say working.
0,156,11,TEAL'C,ONeill merely believes that ...
0,156,11,CARTER,"Guys, Im fine."
0,156,11,DANIEL,You can hardly blame him for wanting to send in back-up. Im sure it has nothing to do with you ...
0,156,11,CARTER,"I understand. Hes just being cautious. Thanks, guys."
0,156,13,DAVIS,"General, if I might have a moment with you. Were completely stalled. The Amrians cant agree with each other, let alone us. Theyre like bickering children."
0,156,13,O'NEILL,Maybe they need a time-out.
0,156,14,AMRIAN 1,The Plains of Goran are sacred ground.
0,156,14,AMRIAN 2,To the Plainsmen.
0,156,14,AMRIAN 1,I am a Plainsman.
0,156,14,AMRIAN 2,I know.
0,156,14,AMRIAN 1,I take offence at that.
0,156,14,AMRIAN 2,Offence - now theres an idea!
0,156,14,O'NEILL,"Howdy, folks."
0,156,14,AMRIAN 1,"General, I think it would be best ..."
0,156,14,O'NEILL,"What dyou say we take a little break? All this negotiating, its just exhausting, and youve been at it a whole hour already. Weve prepared special quarters for you. You can relax, get a massage, room service, whatever you need. Cmon, Ill show you."
0,156,15,O'NEILL,"Huh?! Fellas! What dyou think? Alright, so its not the Ritz but we do what we can around here. Knock twice when youre ready to talk like adults, alright?"
0,156,15,AMRIAN 1,"W-w-wait, General!"
0,156,15,AMRIAN 2,You dont expect us to share one room?!
0,156,15,O'NEILL,"Not ... amicably at first, but I have great hope for you boys."
0,156,16,AMRIAN 1,You cant do this!
0,156,16,AMRIAN 2,Open this door at once!
0,156,16,O'NEILL,Nobody gets out.
0,156,17,O'NEILL,Dear General Hammond. Wish you were here and that I was not.
0,156,18,O'NEILL,ONeill.
0,156,20,GILMOR,"Good morning, sir. The delegates from Amra are furious - they are demanding to be released and say theres no chance that a trade agreement will ever happen between our governments now."
0,156,20,O'NEILL,"Did they try the donuts? You made sure they were Krispy Kremes, right?"
0,156,20,GILMOR,"Uh, shall I release them and send them home, sir?"
0,156,20,O'NEILL,Give em another day.
0,156,20,GILMOR,"But, sir, I ..."
0,156,20,O'NEILL,No coffee?
0,156,20,GILMOR,"Uh, sorry, I can get some ..."
0,156,20,O'NEILL,Whats next?
0,156,20,GILMOR,"Uh, well, uh, Doctor Lee needs to see you right away concerning the plant from P6J-908; uh, SG-1 and -3 are in the Gateroom preparing to embark; and, oh, it turns out that the red, white and blue bunting is ... unavailable."
0,156,20,O'NEILL,No bunting.
0,156,20,GILMOR,They can get some blue and white and mix in some red.
0,156,20,O'NEILL,It just wont be the same.
0,156,21,CARTER,Sir.
0,156,21,O'NEILL,"Good morning, people. Sure wish I was going with you, but Ive got a big day planned, tasting menu items for the buffet!"
0,156,22,CARTER,"Have fun, sir."
0,156,22,O'NEILL,You know I will. Watch your back. Mind the curfew.
0,156,23,CARTER,
0,156,23,REYNOLDS,Colonel?
0,156,23,CARTER,Colonel?
0,156,23,REYNOLDS,Boscoe and Peterson can watch the Gate.
0,156,23,CARTER,Were fine. Simple recon - well stay in radio contact.
0,156,23,REYNOLDS,Standard perimeter.
0,156,24,LEE,"Well, the good news is it hasnt eaten anybody yet."
0,156,24,O'NEILL,"Well, thank you, Seymour!"
0,156,24,LEE,"Yeah, obviously we underestimated its growth properties. It seems to respond really dramatically to any kind of visible light. Yeah, well, I thought of that. I just thought you might like to see it. Dont worry, well get it under control. Sir?"
0,156,25,TEAL'C,There are signs of recent Jaffa activity in the area.
0,156,26,CARTER,Try the wrist device again.
0,156,26,TEAL'C,I have tried it several times.
0,156,26,CARTER,Im getting some faint energy readings.
0,156,28,REYNOLDS,
0,156,29,GILMOR,"Sir, Colonel Reynolds has dialled in from P2X-887. Hes lost contact with"
0,156,30,REYNOLDS,"One alkesh. It buzzed the Gate and flew off. No sign of the enemy since then, sir. Ive been unable to make radio contact with SG-1 going on nineteen minutes. Requesting back-up and permission to begin searching."
0,156,30,O'NEILL,
0,156,30,REYNOLDS,"Thank you, sir."
0,156,31,LEE,"Well have to close down the entire level; seal it off. Not only does it have amazing growth properties but its proving extremely difficult to eradicate. We think its, uh, using the ventilation shafts to spread airborne spores."
0,156,33,REYNOLDS,"We looked everywhere. No sign of them. Im sorry, sir."
0,156,33,O'NEILL,You were there to watch their backs.
0,156,33,REYNOLDS,"Yes, sir. Colonel Carter insisted we secure the Gate."
0,156,34,WALTER,Unauthorised incoming wormhole.
0,156,34,WALTER,"No IDC yet, sir."
0,156,34,O'NEILL,"Stand down, boys. And what do you want?"
0,156,34,BAAL,I have your friends.
0,156,34,O'NEILL,And?
0,156,34,BAAL,I propose an exchange.
0,156,34,O'NEILL,For what?
0,156,34,BAAL,Not what - whom.
0,156,34,O'NEILL,Whatever.
0,156,34,BAAL,Camulus.
0,156,34,O'NEILL,Who?
0,156,34,BAAL,Ill transmit a Gate address. You will send him to me if you want to see your friends alive again.
0,156,34,O'NEILL,Let me think about it.
0,156,34,BAAL,You have one day.
0,156,34,O'NEILL,"Is that, like, one Earth day, or ... ."
0,156,37,GILMOR,"Nothing reported from the teams in the field, rebel Jaffa, the TokRa , nobody seems to have any intel on SG-1; and as ordered Camulus is being transferred here from the facility where he was being held. He should be here shortly."
0,156,38,REYNOLDS,"Even if we did comply and send Camulus to the address Baal transmitted, we cant risk opening the iris here to let SG-1 through. This could all be a trick to get us to do just that."
0,156,38,O'NEILL,I know.
0,156,38,REYNOLDS,Any type of exchange would have to involve a Stargate on another planet. I made some suggestions. Are you really considering turning Camulus over to Baal?
0,156,39,O'NEILL,Its on the table.
0,156,39,GILMOR,Hes here.
0,156,39,O'NEILL,"Colonel, have your team ready."
0,156,39,REYNOLDS,"Yes, sir."
0,156,39,GILMOR,Isnt it already too late?
0,156,39,REYNOLDS,"General ONeill was once captured by Baal. He was tortured, killed, and brought back to life using a sarcophagus more times than you would care to imagine. SG-1 never gave up then, and General ONeill wont now. There isnt a man or woman on this base that would."
0,156,40,O'NEILL,"Baal has three of my people, and hes offered up an exchange."
0,156,40,CAMULUS,For me.
0,156,40,O'NEILL,Any idea why?
0,156,40,CAMULUS,There are many possible reasons.
0,156,40,O'NEILL,Pick one. Nothin? You offered to help us if we granted you asylum.
0,156,40,CAMULUS,I did not expect to be treated like a prisoner.
0,156,40,O'NEILL,Youre a Goauld!
0,156,40,CAMULUS,What are you going to do?
0,156,40,O'NEILL,Give me one good reason why I shouldnt turn you over.
0,156,40,CAMULUS,Baal cannot be trusted.
0,156,40,O'NEILL,Yeah.
0,156,40,CAMULUS,"No matter what you do, he will never return your friends to you."
0,156,42,GILMOR,I thought you were just going to question him.
0,156,42,O'NEILL,He didnt have the right answers.
0,156,42,GILMOR,"General, this goes against official policy regarding prisoner exchanges."
0,156,42,O'NEILL,Hes not a prisoner. He requested asylum - Im ungranting it.
0,156,42,GILMOR,You could be court martialled.
0,156,42,O'NEILL,"You know, if it gets my team back, I dont care."
0,156,42,GILMOR,But you know it wont - youre sacrificing him for nothing.
0,156,43,O'NEILL,"Go, go, go."
0,156,43,O'NEILL,"Lets take a walk, you and me. Cmon. Ive done everything I can. Its up to you. Last chance."
0,156,43,CAMULUS,"In spite of what you think, I am not a coward."
0,156,43,O'NEILL,"I think you are. Well, it was worth a try. Take him back to his cell."
0,156,44,WALTER,It was a bluff.
0,156,45,GILMOR,"You could have told me, sir. How can I do my job if you dont trust me?"
0,156,46,O'NEILL,Not my problem.
0,156,46,GILMOR,"Wait, wait, wait, Camulus would like to talk to you."
0,156,47,CAMULUS,"I cannot stay here. If Baal is truly so determined to have revenge, he will not stop at this. It is not safe for you to harbour me any more."
0,156,47,O'NEILL,So what?
0,156,47,CAMULUS,I am saying I am willing to leave.
0,156,47,O'NEILL,Out of the goodness of your heart?
0,156,47,CAMULUS,Of course not. When I asked for asylum I did not expect to rot in a cell for the rest of my life.
0,156,47,O'NEILL,"Well, work with me. Give me something. Ill see what I can do."
0,156,47,CAMULUS,I can tell you a planet where there is a device created by the Ancients.
0,156,47,O'NEILL,Whats it do?
0,156,47,CAMULUS,I do not know. I never could discover its secrets. Perhaps you can.
0,156,47,O'NEILL,You think this is what Baals really after?
0,156,47,CAMULUS,"While I never disclosed its location, I once made the mistake of bragging that I had found the device at a meeting of the System Lords."
0,156,47,O'NEILL,"Hard to believe, you bragging"
0,156,48,O'NEILL,"I knew it wasnt easy for you, but had I known what it was really like, I would have tried to be less ... of a pain in the ... ass. At least, I would have tried harder."
0,156,49,WALTER,Unscheduled offworld activation.
0,156,50,O'NEILL,Walter?
0,156,50,WALTER,"Receiving SG-3s IDC, sir."
0,156,50,O'NEILL,Open it.
0,156,50,WALTER,"Yes, sir."
0,156,51,REYNOLDS,"Just like you said, sir, some sort of Ancient device, the size of a large room."
0,156,51,O'NEILL,Any idea what it does?
0,156,51,REYNOLDS,Ill leave that up to the tech guys. But I can tell you this: I know why he couldnt turn it on.
0,156,52,REYNOLDS,It wasnt plugged in.
0,156,52,GILMOR,What is it?
0,156,52,O'NEILL,Its a ZPM.
0,156,52,GILMOR,Whats that?
0,156,52,LEE,"A Zero Point Module. Um, its an Ancient power source that draws its energy from subspace."
0,156,52,REYNOLDS,Its the only thing powerful enough to activate the Ancient defence weapons SG-1 found down in Antarctica. The one we have is pretty much dead ...
0,156,53,LEE,"We-he-hell, this one sure isnt!"
0,156,53,GILMOR,How good is it?
0,156,53,LEE,"Well, Im gonna have to do some more detailed analysis but these preliminary readings indicate at least fifty percent capacity."
0,156,53,GILMOR,"Well, thats, thats good, isnt it?"
0,156,54,LEE,Scuse me.
0,156,54,O'NEILL,Its that damn plant.
0,156,55,WALTER,"Weve lost power to all control systems. ... Yes, sir."
0,156,56,O'NEILL,We paid the electric bill. I checked.
0,156,56,LEE,The plant is in the wall. Its interfering with power and communication lines.
0,156,56,O'NEILL,Theres no light in the walls.
0,156,56,LEE,"I know, but as long as any part of it is exposed to light, it seems like it can feed the unexposed areas. Now, Im recommending we keep the whole base on minimal emergency lighting, just until we get the problem under control."
0,156,56,O'NEILL,How long?
0,156,56,LEE,"Well, thats a little difficult to say, because first we have to figure out how to get the problem under control."
0,156,58,O'NEILL,Where are we?
0,156,58,WALTER,The dialling computers offline.
0,156,58,SILER,There must be a circuit board that got fried when we tried to restore power to the system.
0,156,58,WALTER,Incoming wormholes will connect and we can still receive radio communication and IDCs but ...
0,156,58,O'NEILL,The iris?
0,156,58,WALTER,Manual control.
0,156,58,O'NEILL,What about dialling the Gate manually?
0,156,58,SILER,"Uh, thats a problem. The inner ring seems to be locked in place. We tried disconnecting the control interface but ..."
0,156,58,WALTER,There was a Gate diagnostic running when the power went down. Could be something to do with the commands being exchanged at the time.
0,156,58,O'NEILL,Bottom line.
0,156,58,WALTER,We cant dial out.
0,156,58,O'NEILL,Okay.
0,156,58,O'NEILL,"What? Oh, God."
0,156,58,GILMOR,"Sorry to wake you, sir."
0,156,58,O'NEILL,Feels like its been ten minutes.
0,156,58,GILMOR,"Yeah, it has. Theres an incoming wormhole - Baal wants to talk."
0,156,59,O'NEILL,Baal - sorry to keep you waiting. Just taking a little nap.
0,156,59,BAAL,The deadline has passed.
0,156,59,O'NEILL,"Yeah, look, were having a little technical difficulty here."
0,156,59,BAAL,Are your friends lives meaningless to you?
0,156,59,O'NEILL,Hey! This is not a stall tactic. I would have called you sooner but we cant dial out at the moment.
0,156,59,BAAL,Why not?
0,156,59,O'NEILL,"Well, Im not really sure. Heres some irony for you: Carter - have this thing fixed like that. No offence there, Siler."
0,156,59,SILER,"Uh, none taken, sir."
0,156,59,O'NEILL,"Good. So, why dont you just send her on through. Before you know it youll have old Camel-ass back in your grubby little mitts."
0,156,59,BAAL,You dare mock me.
0,156,59,O'NEILL,"Baal, cmon, you should know ... Of course I dare mock you."
0,156,59,BAAL,You have one more day.
0,156,59,GILMOR,Is it really wise to provoke him?
0,156,59,O'NEILL,Its what I do.
0,156,60,DAVIS,"Over two years ago, the TokRa provided us with the formula for a Goauld poison theyd developed. Weve been modifying it - manufacturing as much as we can use as a defensive option in the event of another attack on Earth. Area 51 is confirming that there is currently enough to negate a sizeable enemy force."
0,156,60,REYNOLDS,We think we can effectively neutralise and invade three Goauld-occupied planets.
0,156,60,DAVIS,"Now, the poison is non-persistent, so a limited time before potential reinforcements become a factor."
0,156,60,REYNOLDS,And determining which of Baals planets to target is still an educated guess.
0,156,60,DAVIS,Were still gathering intel on exactly where SG-1s being held.
0,156,60,O'NEILL,This poison - does it kill Jaffa as well as Goauld?
0,156,60,DAVIS,Thats right.
0,156,60,O'NEILL,How many casualties are we talking about?
0,156,61,REYNOLDS,Thousands. Tens of thousands.
0,156,61,O'NEILL,So its not really a rescue plan - its a full-scale attack.
0,156,61,REYNOLDS,That would most certainly provoke a reaction - possibly another attack on Earth.
0,156,61,DAVIS,"But considering the fact that we now have a ZPM to power the Ancient defences, I dont think ..."
0,156,62,GILMOR,"Sorry to interrupt, sir, but Camulus is insisting that he speak with you again."
0,156,62,CAMULUS,Did you not find something of value on the planet of which I spoke?
0,156,62,O'NEILL,"Oh, yeah, we did."
0,156,62,CAMULUS,Then why have you not released me? Or do you still believe you can trade me for your friends?
0,156,63,LEE,"Gamma radiation seems to work. Were preparing a method of delivering a strong enough level to the entire base all at once. Now, non-essential personnel are going to have to be evacuated; everyone else is going to have to wear protective suits. You have to get General ONeill to sign off on this right away."
0,156,63,GILMOR,"Y-you know, he hasnt slept in over two days."
0,156,63,LEE,Yeah. Thats why Im asking you to do it!
0,156,63,GILMOR,Right.
0,156,64,PRIOR,Im cancelling the Presidents visit.
0,156,64,O'NEILL,Really? Why would you do that?!
0,156,64,PRIOR,Im surprised you can joke at a time like this.
0,156,64,O'NEILL,"Ah, its pretty much all I can do at the moment."
0,156,64,PRIOR,The flagship team is in the hands of the enemy. You cant dial the Stargate. The base is overrun by an alien plant!
0,156,65,O'NEILL,We did find a ZPM.
0,156,65,PRIOR,Sure.
0,156,65,O'NEILL,Give it another day.
0,156,65,PRIOR,You think you can get everything resolved by then?
0,156,65,O'NEILL,Wait a minute - think theres a joke in there somewhere. Got nothing.
0,156,66,O'NEILL,And so I regretfully submit my resignation. And to be clear - the regret is not so much about the resigning part but the fact that I was deluded enough to think I had possessed even one iota of the ability needed to fill your sizeable and shiny shoes.
0,156,67,GILMOR,"Doctor Lee just called down, sir. He feels confident the plant has been fully eradicated."
0,156,67,O'NEILL,I wish I did.
0,156,67,GILMOR,"Oh, and the dialling computer is back online."
0,156,69,WALTER,Chevron four encoded.
0,156,69,GILMOR,Youre releasing him?
0,156,69,O'NEILL,We made a deal. We got a ZPM.
0,156,69,GILMOR,"Look, I know we can finally dial Pegasus again and still defend Earth if we have to but ..."
0,156,69,WALTER,Chevron five encoded.
0,156,69,GILMOR,Control Room. ... Its Doctor Lee - he says its important.
0,156,70,O'NEILL,Yeah. ... Abort the dialling procedure.
0,156,72,LEE,"Basically, it shouldnt be glowing like this."
0,156,72,O'NEILL,Why is it?
0,156,72,LEE,"Well, its funny really ..."
0,156,72,O'NEILL,I like funny.
0,156,72,LEE,"No, this isnt the good kind of funny. I-I-I think it was the gamma radiation we used to kill the plant that revealed this."
0,156,72,O'NEILL,Revealed what?
0,156,72,LEE,It illuminated a substance foreign to what we know to be the normal molecular make-up of a ZPM.
0,156,72,O'NEILL,And?
0,156,72,LEE,"Well, we managed to scrape some microscopic fragments from the casing and run some tests and, uh, well, youre gonna want these."
0,156,73,LEE,This is what happens when you introduce a constant electric charge.
0,156,74,O'NEILL,The ZPM is booby-trapped?
0,156,74,LEE,"We were gonna send it to Antarctica! Look, can you imagine if someone had taken it and plugged it into the chair in the Ancient outpost? I-I cant even imagine the magnitude of the explosion. A charged ZPM detonating that - I dont know, I mean, it could have destroyed the whole planet."
0,156,74,GILMOR,Thats why Camulus was so eager to leave.
0,156,74,O'NEILL,Can you undo it?
0,156,74,LEE,"Uh, well, you know we havent actually"
0,156,74,O'NEILL,Yes or no?
0,156,74,CAMULUS,I have no idea what youre talking about.
0,156,74,O'NEILL,"When you couldnt figure out what the Ancient device was for, you tampered with the power source so nobody else could."
0,156,74,CAMULUS,I did nothing of the kind.
0,156,74,O'NEILL,Cami.
0,156,74,CAMULUS,Worth a try.
0,156,74,O'NEILL,Heres the deal: howd you like a chance to kill Baal?
0,156,74,CAMULUS,An exchange. You want me to use the Ancient device to trade for the lives of your friends.
0,156,74,O'NEILL,Exactly.
0,156,74,CAMULUS,Amusing.
0,156,75,O'NEILL,Alright?
0,156,75,CAMULUS,Coming with me?
0,156,75,REYNOLDS,Were taking you to another planet first. Well wait for SG-1 there.
0,156,76,WALTER,"Receiving SG-3s IDC, sir."
0,156,76,O'NEILL,Open it.
0,156,76,O'NEILL,Youre late.
0,156,76,REYNOLDS,"We thought wed give it an extra hour, sir. We knew it was a long shot."
0,156,76,O'NEILL,"Thank you, Colonel. Dismissed."
0,156,76,GILMOR,"Sir. Uh, Colonel Reynolds would like a moment."
0,156,76,O'NEILL,Fine.
0,156,76,GILMOR,"Hes in the Gateroom, sir."
0,156,77,O'NEILL,Whats goin on?
0,156,77,REYNOLDS,"General, we just wanted you to know, whatever you decide, were behind you one hundred percent. You just need to give the order and were ready to go."
0,156,77,O'NEILL,"I know you are, Colonel. Thank you. All of you. Dismissed."
0,156,79,SILER,"Good night, sir."
0,156,79,O'NEILL,"Good night, Siler."
0,156,79,TANNOY,Unscheduled offworld activation.
0,156,80,GILMOR,Its SG-1s identification code. Sergeant OBrien transmitted a hold signal back through the Gate and is awaiting your instruction.
0,156,81,O'NEILL,OBrien?
0,156,81,OBRIEN,"We have audio contact, sir - its Colonel Carter."
0,156,81,O'NEILL,Carter?
0,156,81,CARTER,"Were under heavy fire, sir, open the iris."
0,156,81,O'NEILL,Negative.
0,156,81,O'NEILL,Can you reroute?
0,156,81,CARTER,Negative - the DHD is no longer accessible.
0,156,82,DANIEL,"Jack, whats goin on?!"
0,156,82,O'NEILL,Youve been in enemy hands. You know the protocol. Weve no way of knowing if your iris code is secure.
0,156,82,DANIEL,What the hell are you talking about?!
0,156,82,O'NEILL,You were captured by Baal.
0,156,82,DANIEL,Baal?! Were on P2X-887! We were trapped in Anubis secret base and when we came out a Jaffa force was waiting for us at the Gate.
0,156,83,TEAL'C,It appears these Jaffa are loyal to Baal.
0,156,83,CARTER,"Sir, the Gates gonna shut down and we wont be able to dial out again."
0,156,84,O'NEILL,Open it. Youre clear.
0,156,85,O'NEILL,"Nice! Hey, guys."
0,156,85,CARTER,"Thank you, sir."
0,156,85,O'NEILL,So - trapped in a secret base all this time. Go figure.
0,156,85,TEAL'C,The wrist device allowed us access.
0,156,85,DANIEL,We couldnt get back out.
0,156,85,CARTER,You thought Baal had captured us?
0,156,85,O'NEILL,Thats what he said.
0,156,85,CARTER,How did he even know we were missing?
0,156,85,O'NEILL,Reynolds saw an alkesh.
0,156,85,DANIEL,Baal must have had his Jaffa looking for the base.
0,156,85,CARTER,Probably intercepted any radio chatter.
0,156,85,TEAL'C,That would explain the ambush.
0,156,85,CARTER,Baals Jaffa couldnt find the base but they figured if we turned up ...
0,156,85,O'NEILL,"Its a great story. More importantly, did Anubis leave anything cool behind?"
0,156,86,DANIEL,"Not really, no."
0,156,86,O'NEILL,Nuts.
0,156,87,O'NEILL,Colonel Carter! How are ya?
0,156,87,CARTER,Im good. Thanks for asking.
0,156,87,O'NEILL,Yeah.
0,156,87,CARTER,"You not gonna dress for the occasion, sir?"
0,156,88,O'NEILL,"Well, you know me, I love dressing up. I was just on my way."
0,156,89,CARTER,"Sir, I wanted to talk to you ..."
0,156,89,O'NEILL,"Carter, your evaluation is done. And I think youd be very pleased."
0,156,89,CARTER,Really?
0,156,89,O'NEILL,You had doubts?
0,156,89,CARTER,Honestly? I was wondering whether you were completely confident in my leadership skills.
0,156,89,O'NEILL,Arent you?
0,156,89,CARTER,Ive been second-guessing myself for ordering SG-3 to remain at the Gate.
0,156,89,O'NEILL,"Oh, pshaw! It was standard recon. Your tactics in dealing with the ambush - perfect. You should read what Tealc and Daniel wrote about your conduct under fire."
0,156,89,CARTER,Can I?
0,156,89,O'NEILL,No.
0,156,89,CARTER,Damn!
0,156,89,O'NEILL,Tealc said you were an animal.
0,156,89,CARTER,Huh! Such an exaggerator.
0,156,89,O'NEILL,"Yeah, isnt he? Well, this is where I go to take off the clothes I prefer and don the clothes I abhor."
0,156,89,CARTER,"Uh, sir, quickly, I wanted to talk to you about something else. I was reading Doctor Lees report about the tainted ZPM. I think he may have underestimated the explosive potential. It could have actually destroyed the entire solar system."
0,156,89,O'NEILL,Whats the difference?
0,156,89,CARTER,"Well, my point is, if we figured it out, so could Baal. He could use it as a weapon against us."
0,156,89,O'NEILL,"All true, Carter - which is exactly why I didnt give Camulus the tainted one."
0,156,89,CARTER,Sir?
0,156,89,O'NEILL,"I gave him the dead one. Its worthless, right?"
0,156,89,CARTER,Baals gonna be pretty pissed at Camulus.
0,156,89,O'NEILL,Yeah.
0,156,89,GILMOR,"General, the Presidents motorcade is through the gates - he should be getting on the elevator momentarily. Sir, I-I think you should know Ill be leaving tomorrow."
0,156,89,O'NEILL,Really?
0,156,89,GILMOR,"Yes, sir. The truth is, Ive been here on a temporary special assignment from the President."
0,156,89,O'NEILL,Oh?
0,156,89,GILMOR,"Sort of a civilian audit, if you will."
0,156,89,O'NEILL,Of the SGC?
0,156,89,GILMOR,Of you.
0,156,89,O'NEILL,I know.
0,156,89,GILMOR,You do?!
0,156,89,O'NEILL,General Hammond told me.
0,156,89,GILMOR,"Well, he wasnt supposed to."
0,156,89,O'NEILL,"Well, dont tell anyone!"
0,156,89,GILMOR,"Ah. Well, then, you know the President wanted to make sure you were settling in before he came and shook your hand and fully endorsed you as the leader of this base."
0,156,89,O'NEILL,Uh-huh.
0,156,89,GILMOR,"Obviously, hes here, so, uh - what I mean is I just want you to know how much respect I have for what you do here - and for you."
0,156,89,O'NEILL,"Thanks. Shall we? Oh, by the way, did you, uh, let those Amran delegates go?"
0,156,89,GILMOR,"I did, sir, yes. Uh, Major Davis said they seem much more willing to negotiate now."
0,156,89,O'NEILL,Dyou think they liked the fruit basket?
0,156,90,GILMOR,"I think so, sir."
0,156,90,O'NEILL,I put a lot of thought into that.
