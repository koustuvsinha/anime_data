0,157,1,LEDA,Its time.
0,157,1,DANIEL,Wait.
0,157,1,LEDA,Its OK. Just relax. Give your vision a moment to adjust - you havent used it for a while. Hows that?
0,157,1,DANIEL,Better.
0,157,1,LEDA,Your eyes - its nice to finally see them.
0,157,1,DANIEL,Leda.
0,157,1,LEDA,Welcome back.
0,157,1,DANIEL,Where am I?
0,157,1,LEDA,Many miles from the city. This house belonged to my uncle. Were safe here.
0,157,1,DANIEL,The city - I remember being there. Something terrible happened. Many people died.
0,157,1,LEDA,"Theres food, if you feel strong enough to eat."
0,157,1,DANIEL,"Its our fault, isnt it? None of this would have happened if we hadnt come here."
0,157,1,LEDA,"Youre alive. And considering what youve been through, that alone is a miracle."
0,157,1,GUIDE,First discovered in the Corillian wastelands over one hundred and fifty years ago and the highlight of our antiquities collection - the Great Ring of Avidan.
0,157,3,GUIDE,"Researchers estimate the Ring to be at least several thousand years old, and while its origin remains a subject of debate, many believe it was created by ancient worshippers to honour their gods. Its thought that the peculiar symbols on the Ring itself represent the names of the gods. However, no-one has been able to decipher ... ... exactly what they mean ..."
0,157,4,TOURIST,Is that part of the exhibit?
0,157,5,CARTER,Commander Gareth.
0,157,5,GARETH,"In the name of the people of the Rand Protectorate, I welcome you. Youre Colonel Carter?"
0,157,5,CARTER,"This is Tealc, and Doctor Daniel Jackson."
0,157,5,GARETH,"It is a pleasure to finally meet you all face to face. But please, come. We have many questions, as Im sure you do as well."
0,157,6,CARTER,Sorry about scaring the tourists. Weve made first contact with a lot of planets but this is the first time weve found ourselves coming out of a museum piece.
0,157,6,GARETH,"One of our artefacts suddenly coming to life was a little surprising, but that pales in comparison to its purpose. It is almost beyond imagining."
0,157,6,KANE,As is the fact that youre human.
0,157,6,GARETH,My chief aide - Jared Kane.
0,157,6,DANIEL,"Well, believe it or not theres actually a good reason for us being human."
0,157,6,CARTER,Which well get to in due time.
0,157,6,GARETH,"Colonel, I hope that once we gain each others trust youll be able to shed some light on the technology that powers the Great Ring. It is unlike anything we have seen before."
0,157,6,CARTER,"We call it the Stargate, and our people share the same hope, Commander."
0,157,6,GARETH,"Of course, in due time."
0,157,6,DANIEL,I take it the Great Ring is a recurring motif in your culture.
0,157,6,GARETH,It is simply a reminder of certain traditions that pre-date our age of enlightenment. Most people wear them more for the sake of fashion than for religious belief.
0,157,6,KANE,Our history tells of an age when all-powerful gods ruled our world. The Great Ring was supposedly the source of their power.
0,157,6,GARETH,"Of course, we know these are merely legends from our ancient past. However, the activation of the Ring may well cause a stir amongst those few who still follow the old ways."
0,157,7,LEDA,Sorry. I didnt mean to wake you.
0,157,7,DANIEL,Its alright.
0,157,7,LEDA,For the pain. I wish I could give you more but our medicine is in short supply.
0,157,7,DANIEL,Thank you.
0,157,7,LEDA,Ill leave you alone.
0,157,7,DANIEL,No - please stay.
0,157,7,ONEILL,"How did it go with the, uh ...?"
0,157,7,DANIEL,"Caledonians? Not so well, actually. My time with the representatives was severely limited by Rand security forces. Apparently Gareth had national security concerns - mainly that wed tell the Caledonians too much about the Stargate."
0,157,7,ONEILL,Let me venture a wild guess: they dont get along so good.
0,157,7,DANIEL,The Rand Protectorate and the Caledonian Federation have been locked in a state of cold war for decades. Each nation has enough weapons to wipe each other off the face of the planet.
0,157,7,CARTER,Sounds depressingly familiar.
0,157,7,DANIEL,"Theres actually a third element which has me a little more concerned - a group of religious fundamentalists led by a man named Soren. Now, these people think that all life on the planet was created by ancient gods and that these gods will some day return and reward them for their faith."
0,157,7,CARTER,"And by coming through the Stargate, we confirmed their beliefs."
0,157,7,DANIEL,"Because the Gate was activated in a public place, the Rand government has been unable to prevent the rumours from spreading. Now, before we made contact with them, these people were considered zealots who took the ancient texts too literally. The Gate being activated has given them all they need to prove that they were right all along. Their numbers will grow."
0,157,7,ONEILL,Thats terrible And yet - not our problem.
0,157,8,DANIEL,"Jack, you have to let me go back."
0,157,8,ONEILL,"If what you say is true, things are gonna get a little out of hand over there."
0,157,8,DANIEL,"Yes, because of us. If we hadnt chosen to pay them a little visit ..."
0,157,8,ONEILL,"... theyd be far better off, I know. Daniel, were always sticking our collective noses where they dont belong. Its what we do."
0,157,8,DANIEL,"I could help them understand what theyre facing - make them see its not the end of the world. If we leave now, who knows what could happen? We have to help them. You know that."
0,157,8,ONEILL,"Regular contact, no exceptions. The second things start getting a little squirly ..."
0,157,8,DANIEL,Thank you.
0,157,8,ONEILL,Daniel! Squirly.
0,157,8,DANIEL,Squirly.
0,157,9,LEDA,You shouldnt be standing.
0,157,9,DANIEL,"Oh, dont let appearances fool you, I still feel terrible. Leda, everything youve done for me ..."
0,157,9,LEDA,... has been for my own sake as well as yours. So much has happened. Caring for you has helped me continue on.
0,157,9,DANIEL,"Yeah - what has happened exactly? I mean, uh, I remember being in the bunker with Commander Gareth, and we were attacked, and the rest is a fog."
0,157,9,LEDA,Jared is away searching for survivors. He should be back in a few days time. I think it would be best if he answered your questions.
0,157,9,DANIEL,"Jared Kane. Yeah, I remember him - he was in the bunker as well."
0,157,9,LEDA,My husband was chief aide to Commander Gareth.
0,157,9,DANIEL,Husband. Was.
0,157,9,LEDA,He insisted I move here when the fighting reached the capital. He felt you would be safest in my care.
0,157,9,DANIEL,"Yeah. Look, no offence, but Ive really gotta get back to my own world, or at least contact them and let them know Im OK, so ..."
0,157,9,LEDA,"Trying to reach the Great Ring will be impossible. Rebel patrols have been sighted in the area. Even to leave the estate grounds would be dangerous. Not to mention the fact that you are far from healed. You must rest, Daniel."
0,157,9,DANIEL,"Leda, what happened to Commander Gareth?"
0,157,11,ONEILL,"Give me good news, Colonel."
0,157,11,CARTER,"I wish I could, sir. We met with Soren, leader of the rebels, but it was less constructive than wed hoped."
0,157,11,ONEILL,How much less?
0,157,11,CARTER,We were only allowed to see him for fifteen minutes.
0,157,11,TEALC,After keeping us waiting for several hours.
0,157,11,ONEILL,"Well, important matters of state, no doubt"
0,157,11,CARTER,"Hes managed to unite all the fundamentalist factions in the Rand Protectorate, which effectively puts him in control."
0,157,11,TEALC,He was most unwilling to allow us to search for Daniel Jackson.
0,157,11,CARTER,"Before he insisted we leave, he did promise he would look into the matter on our behalf. Whatever that means."
0,157,11,ONEILL,Right. What about a UAV?
0,157,11,CARTER,"He wont give us access to the surface, plus he claims it would interfere with their own radio communication systems. Im sorry, sir, but at this point we have no way of knowing if Daniel is still alive."
0,157,11,DANIEL,And what does blue mean?
0,157,11,KANE,Its our second-highest level of military alert status. Theres been civil unrest in several urban centres across the country. Over a dozen municipalities have fallen into the hands of Sorens troops. Our forces are in the process of pacifying those areas as we speak.
0,157,11,DANIEL,Pacifying?
0,157,11,KANE,Reclaiming our cities from the hands of religious madmen.
0,157,11,DANIEL,So civil unrest means you go to blue.
0,157,11,KANE,"Under normal circumstances, no. Unfortunately, the situation has caused other problems."
0,157,12,DANIEL,Whats going on?
0,157,12,KANE,We were forced to heighten our alert status to match that of the Caledonians.
0,157,13,GARETH,"... and I promise you, we will share this technology with you once we fully understand it."
0,157,13,TREYDAN,You mean once youve assessed its advantages to your national security. You have refused to allow our scientists access to the Great Ring. You have limited our access to the offworlders. We do not feel as much a part of this great discovery as you do.
0,157,13,GARETH,"And had the Ring been activated on Caledonian soil, you would have done no differently. Minister Treydan, I am simply asking your government for patience. Stand down your high alert. We will do the same."
0,157,13,TREYDAN,"Typically you trust your people too much, Commander. Caledonia has been under strict martial law since news of the offworlders arrival began to spread. Our domestic security remains intact."
0,157,13,GARETH,The citizens of this world are not children. They just need time to come to terms with this information.
0,157,13,TREYDAN,"Soren and his followers have already seized control of more than a dozen of your cities. Your people are panicked, and your country is on the verge of collapse. I urge you to deal with the situation in a swift and decisive manner. Should control of the Rand Protectorate fall into Sorens hands, well consider it an act of war."
0,157,14,DANIEL,"This is Daniel Jackson calling Stargate Command, come in, please. ... This is Daniel Jackson calling Stargate Command, please respond. ... This is Daniel Jackson calling Stargate Command, come in, please. ... This is Daniel Jackson calling Stargate Command, please respond."
0,157,15,LEDA,Any luck?
0,157,15,DANIEL,"No, nothing yet."
0,157,15,LEDA,Youve been trying for days.
0,157,15,DANIEL,"Something seems to be jamming all the signals Im picking up. I mean, theres people out there but nothing clear enough for me to respond to."
0,157,15,LEDA,But you think your friends will be able to hear you.
0,157,15,DANIEL,"Yeah ... thats kind of a timing thing. You see, if the Stargates open theyll be able to pick up my signal - if your Gate isnt buried in rubble, or worse."
0,157,15,LEDA,"Well, while youre waiting to be rescued, you could use some fresh air. Do you think youre up to it?"
0,157,16,LEDA,How can you be sure Soren and his followers arent right? How can you know for certain that the gods they worship arent ...
0,157,16,DANIEL,"Benevolent? Because Ive met more than a few of them. Trust me, theyre the opposite. Theyre definitely not gods."
0,157,16,LEDA,Then what are they?
0,157,16,DANIEL,"Short form? Theyre a parasitical race that steals advanced technology and rules via fear and intimidation. Has a penchant for melodrama. Trust me, if Soren ever actually met one, hed be singing a different tune."
0,157,16,LEDA,But you said you fought them and won.
0,157,16,DANIEL,"Yeah. We got lucky a few times, thats all."
0,157,16,LEDA,"Theres hope, isnt there? You think what happened was your fault, dont you? From what youve told me, it was better that your people activated the Great Ring than the Goauld."
0,157,16,DANIEL,"You think so? Cos right now, Im not so sure."
0,157,16,LEDA,"You couldnt have known what was going to happen. When the fighting began, you could have gone back to your planet but you chose to stay."
0,157,16,DANIEL,Yeah.
0,157,16,LEDA,To try and help us.
0,157,16,DANIEL,For all the good it did.
0,157,16,LEDA,"Daniel, there has been distrust between our country and Caledonia for generations. It was only a matter of time before something set it off. We did this to ourselves. And since youve come here, Ive begun to think we may have a chance to undo it, to rebuild."
0,157,17,DAVIS,This is Stargate Command calling Doctor Jackson. Do you read me?
0,157,18,CARTER,Can you boost the signal?
0,157,18,DAVIS,"Were at maximum gain, Colonel. This is Stargate Command calling Daniel Jackson. Do you copy?"
0,157,19,ONEILL,Anything?
0,157,19,CARTER,"Not yet, sir. Were picking up a lot of transmissions from the planet but none of them are clear enough to tell if theyre from Daniel. We think both sides may have employed radio-jamming measures just prior to the attack, meaning any signals coming from outside the command bunker are a mess. Were working on it."
0,157,19,ONEILL,Anything from SG-9 yet?
0,157,19,CARTER,"Yeah, they just reported in. Sounds like the negotiations are going nowhere, sir. Soren is still refusing to allow us to send any teams to look for Daniel. He said our presence on the planet would only cause more panic and fear."
0,157,19,ONEILL,"Well, OK. Sounds like I should meet these people myself."
0,157,21,DANIEL,Kane.
0,157,21,KANE,Doctor Jackson.
0,157,22,KANE,"We got as close to what was left of the capital as we could. Soren and his troops are conducting full sweeps of the region, searching for survivors. Any suspected of remaining loyal to the old government are executed on the spot."
0,157,22,LEDA,Havent enough people died?
0,157,22,DANIEL,"I dont think that matters to him. Its about continuing the chaos, not peace."
0,157,22,KANE,Youre right. People are too afraid to fight back. Most of them have already given up hope. Its just a matter of time before they pledge their loyalty to Soren.
0,157,22,DANIEL,"Kane, what the hell happened that night? I remember being in the bunker and then waking up here."
0,157,22,KANE,It was the end.
0,157,23,KANE,"Im sorry, Doctor Jackson, you really cant be in here right now."
0,157,23,DANIEL,"Kane, whats going on? I heard something about the Stargate being moved."
0,157,23,KANE,"Rebels have seized control of all of Rands major cities, including sections of the capital itself. We had the Stargate moved into the bunker complex for security purposes."
0,157,23,DANIEL,What are the Caledonians doing?
0,157,23,KANE,"Their missile systems are now fully deployed and primed. As a result, weve done the same. It might be best if you return to your planet now."
0,157,24,OFFICER,Commander. Minister Treydan for you on a coded frequency.
0,157,24,GARETH,Put him through.
0,157,24,TREYDAN,"Commander Gareth, weve been monitoring the situation in your country, and we are most concerned."
0,157,24,GARETH,"I understand, Minister. However, rest assured, we are close to reclaiming vital areas ..."
0,157,24,TREYDAN,"Now is not the time for rhetoric, Commander. Our reports indicate large elements of your military are on the brink of mutiny. Your civil unrest has become a civil war. Should any of your weapons systems fall into the wrong hands, no-one in my country would be safe."
0,157,24,GARETH,"That will not happen, I can promise you."
0,157,24,TREYDAN,"Just as you promised our scientists full access to the Stargate. First you hide information about the alien device, and now you deny your country has slipped into chaos."
0,157,24,GARETH,We respected the guidelines of our treaty to the letter. Our report to you on the Stargate outlined everything we know ...
0,157,24,TREYDAN,Except what you deemed advantageous to your national security.
0,157,25,GARETH,"One moment, Minister."
0,157,25,KANE,"Rebel forces just detonated a large explosive device near one of our missile deployment facilities. As of this moment, we understand the facility to be compromised."
0,157,26,GARETH,"Minister, forgive me. I must cut our conversation short."
0,157,26,TREYDAN,"Commander, my intelligence advisors have just informed me of a massive explosion near one of your missile facilities. Is this true?"
0,157,26,GARETH,We are still gathering information. We will contain the situation ...
0,157,26,TREYDAN,"The time for containment is long past, Commander. We cannot allow your missile facilities to fall into Sorens hands."
0,157,26,GARETH,"Treydan, give us time. This need not escalate."
0,157,26,TREYDAN,"We are targeting your missile sites only. If you do not wish a full-scale war, you will not retaliate."
0,157,26,GARETH,Treydan!
0,157,26,OFFICER,"Commander, weve detected multiple launch signals from Caledonian positions."
0,157,28,KANE,"Its possible the destruction could have been contained if Sorens forces hadnt gained control of one of our missile sites and launched a counter-attack on Caledonia. After that, it evolved into a full-scale war. Within a matter of days, all our cities were levelled. From what we can tell, only a fraction of our population has survived, existing mainly in outlying areas. As for the Caledonians, Ive heard rumours theyre trying to rebuild what they can. It wont be much. They may have struck first, but our missile systems were much more accurate than theirs."
0,157,28,DANIEL,And Soren?
0,157,28,KANE,He used the chaos to make his move on the bunker.
0,157,28,DANIEL,Then how did you save me?
0,157,28,KANE,"Actually, from what I understand, it was you who saved me."
0,157,29,GARETH,Kane ...
0,157,29,DANIEL,This is insane.
0,157,29,KANE,"Sorens forces are moving in on this facility. I can get you to the Stargate, but we have to go now."
0,157,30,KANE,This way!
0,157,30,KANE,Here. Through that door.
0,157,30,DANIEL,"Get down! (He pushes Kane down, then dives to the ground himself just as debris starts falling all around them."
0,157,30,KANE,Loyalist soldiers found us first and got us out of the city. Your wounds were much worse than mine. Bringing you here was the only option.
0,157,30,DANIEL,What happened to Commander Gareth?
0,157,30,KANE,"He was executed shortly after the bunker fell. Since he took power, Soren has set up a provisional government - not that theres much of Rand left to govern. However, we do know he does control whatevers left of the bunker complex, including the Stargate. Im sorry, Doctor Jackson."
0,157,31,ONEILL,"Howdy, fellas. Welcome to Earth."
0,157,31,SOREN,"General ONeill. It is an honour. I greet you in the name of our great nation, Avidan."
0,157,31,CARTER,You changed the name?!
0,157,31,SOREN,Avidan speaks more to our peoples beliefs.
0,157,31,TEALC,It is from an ancient Goauld dialect. It means the gods are just.
0,157,32,ONEILL,Good choice
0,157,33,DANIEL,So youre saying that Soren is still using the bunker as a command centre.
0,157,33,KANE,Damage in the city would be too severe.
0,157,33,DANIEL,"Then he hasnt totally consolidated his power yet, has he? Im saying that if we could somehow re-take the bunker, we would effectively overthrow Soren."
0,157,33,KANE,The bunkers heavily fortified and I have only a dozen men under my command. It would be suicide.
0,157,33,DANIEL,"No, not if we had help. See, if I could reach my friends on Earth, we could regain control of the Gate."
0,157,33,KANE,If you could reach them. I know that youve been trying to make radio contact with your planet since you regained consciousness - without success. I understand your wish to return to your world but it simply isnt possible.
0,157,33,DANIEL,This isnt about that. My people can help you.
0,157,33,KANE,"Like you helped us before? I admire your passion, Doctor Jackson, but too much has happened to fix with one heroic action. We have to accept the fact that Soren has won. Rand belongs to him now."
0,157,34,SOREN,"It is obvious you revere the Great Ring as much as we do, General ONeill."
0,157,34,ONEILL,Oh yeah! We love the old gal. Quite possibly for different reasons than you.
0,157,34,SOREN,"We both seek to defend our peoples way of life, do we not, General? To protect their very existence?"
0,157,34,TEALC,You do not represent the people of your world - you merely kill those who believe differently and would stand against you.
0,157,34,SOREN,You speak what is on your mind. I admire that.
0,157,34,ONEILL,"Actually, in your case, hes holdin back. Carter?"
0,157,34,CARTER,"Commander Soren, were prepared to offer you aid in exchange for help in locating Daniel Jackson: food and medical supplies, plus support personnel to help you stabilise the situation on your planet."
0,157,34,SOREN,You cannot truly believe that your friend is still alive.
0,157,34,ONEILL,"Oh, hes a resourceful fella."
0,157,34,SOREN,"Your offer is most generous, but Im afraid we must decline. We are, however, particularly interested in your weapons technology."
0,157,34,TEALC,Your people are facing starvation and disease.
0,157,34,SOREN,"What has happened to our world is most unfortunate, and yet vital. Those who refused to believe needed to be purged from existence so that we could begin anew."
0,157,34,ONEILL,"Yknow, in these parts, we like to call that crimes against humanity."
0,157,34,CARTER,"If all you care about is spiritual salvation, what do you need the weapons for?"
0,157,34,SOREN,The revolution is not yet complete.
0,157,34,CARTER,You mean you wanna take over Caledonia too.
0,157,34,SOREN,"As I said, the revolution is not yet complete."
0,157,35,DANIEL,"Leda, you have to talk to your husband."
0,157,35,LEDA,And what am I supposed to say to him?
0,157,35,DANIEL,"That its not too late to regain control, to rebuild your country, everything you told me before."
0,157,35,LEDA,"Daniel, I cant."
0,157,35,DANIEL,Why?
0,157,35,LEDA,"Because Id be lying. Jared is right - those of us who were unlucky enough to live through what has happened will die soon enough, either through disease or one of Sorens purges. There is no future."
0,157,35,DANIEL,"Leda, you were right - there is hope. Dont - dont doubt that, please."
0,157,35,LEDA,You believe your people can help us.
0,157,35,DANIEL,Yes.
0,157,35,LEDA,"And what if you do overthrow Soren, what then? You simply leave? When Jared became part of Commander Gareths inner circle, he changed, became remote, distant. Id forgotten what it was like just to talk to someone. To feel."
0,157,35,DANIEL,Leda ...
0,157,35,LEDA,"Ill speak to him, Daniel, but he wont hear me."
0,157,36,ONEILL,Waste of time. Waste.
0,157,36,CARTER,"Sir, I think the fact that he hasnt left yet could mean hes still willing to deal."
0,157,36,TEALC,He has no need for humanitarian aid. The chaos in his country has only served to strengthen his position.
0,157,36,CARTER,"Well, we cant just give up."
0,157,36,ONEILL,"Yes, I know that."
0,157,36,CARTER,Were continuing to monitor countless radio signals coming from the planet. One of them could be from Daniel. If we can find a way to contact him ...
0,157,36,ONEILL,Find it!
0,157,36,CARTER,"Yes, sir."
0,157,37,KANE,"Im telling you, Leda, its madness. All it will accomplish is to wipe out any chance we have to mount a unified resistance in the future."
0,157,37,LEDA,But what if hes right? What if this is our best opportunity to defeat Soren?
0,157,37,KANE,You would have me throw away my life and the lives of my men so that Daniel can return to his world?
0,157,37,LEDA,"Its not about that - its about rebuilding our world. His friends can help us do that. Jared, our people need this."
0,157,37,KANE,"You mean he needs this. Im not blind, Leda - I know that you and Daniel have grown close during his convalescence."
0,157,37,LEDA,"Jared, its not what you think."
0,157,37,KANE,"Let me speak. If I could live the last few years differently, Leda, I would; I would make the time. But we no longer have the luxury for regrets. I need to know: do you love him? Leda."
0,157,37,LEDA,I trust him.
0,157,38,SOREN,"Once order has been established, the people of Avidan will live differently than before - simply, humbly, waiting for our gods inevitable return."
0,157,38,ONEILL,"Yknow, weve met these gods upon whom youre so hot, and trust me when I tell you - theyre not what you think they are."
0,157,38,TEALC,They will reward your worship with enslavement.
0,157,38,SOREN,"You are not the first to try to sway our beliefs, but I can assure you our faith is unshakeable."
0,157,38,TEALC,This is not about faith - this is about a means to power.
0,157,39,ONEILL,That went well
0,157,39,CARTER,"Sir, youd better get up here."
0,157,39,ONEILL,What?
0,157,39,CARTER,"By implementing new spread-spectrum frequency, hopping into our communications"
0,157,39,ONEILL,"Carter, Carter, Carter!"
0,157,39,DANIEL,Helloo? Guys?
0,157,39,CARTER,We found him.
0,157,39,ONEILL,Sweet! Daniel?
0,157,39,DANIEL,Jack? Nice to hear your voice.
0,157,39,ONEILL,Likewise. You coming home or what?
0,157,39,DANIEL,Trying to. As soon as I find my kaltesh.
0,157,39,ONEILL,What?
0,157,39,DANIEL,"Err, looks a lot like my rinkalnok. You know, I lent it to the ... uh ... for grelka greenor day."
0,157,39,ONEILL,Hes changed.
0,157,39,CARTER,"Sir, hes speaking Goauld."
0,157,39,TEALC,Rinkalnok means strategy. Kaltesh speaks of a well-known Jaffa battle tactic - a flanking attack from two sides.
0,157,40,ONEILL,"Yes, Daniel, I remember exactly where I put it. Any other ... thoughts?"
0,157,40,DANIEL,No - just that I hope someones been feeding my lorsak while Ive been away.
0,157,40,CARTER,"Weve pieced together all the Goauld words Daniel gave us. If Tealcs translations are correct, hes suggesting a strategy to retake the bunker."
0,157,40,TEALC,He is proposing a co-ordinated attack against Soren.
0,157,40,CARTER,"We come through the Gate at the same time as Daniel and Kanes men enter from the surface. Im thinking we take SGs-3, -6 and -12 as back-up. We go in hot, secure the Gate, then extract Daniel."
0,157,40,TEALC,He has supplied an estimate of the strength of Sorens forces as well as a possible date and time for the assault.
0,157,40,CARTER,"Our next communication is in five hours. All we need to do is confirm everything and, of course, get a go from you, sir."
0,157,40,ONEILL,"Alright. Well, not to nitpick or anything here, T, but are you sure you got it right?"
0,157,40,TEALC,"I am certain, ONeill."
0,157,40,ONEILL,
0,157,41,KANE,Fifteen men? Thats hardly enough.
0,157,41,DANIEL,"Look, theyre some of the best people on my planet, and theyre trained for missions exactly like this. Itll be enough, trust me. If were gonna do this, we have to set it up now. Theyre waiting for your response."
0,157,42,LEDA,Jared! A rebel patrol is approaching. Hide in the cellar.
0,157,42,KANE,Leda ...
0,157,42,LEDA,I know what to do.
0,157,42,SOLDIER,"In the name of Soren, open the door!"
0,157,43,SOLDIER,Inspection. Stand aside.
0,157,43,LEDA,"Please, just tell me what youre looking for."
0,157,43,SOLDIER,Who owns this house?
0,157,43,LEDA,I do.
0,157,43,SOLDIER,And who else lives here?
0,157,43,LEDA,No-one. Youre hurting me!
0,157,44,SOLDIER,We know loyalist soldiers are in the area. Collaboration is punishable by death. Search the house!
0,157,44,SOLDIER2,"Theres no-one else here, but we found some mens clothes and boots."
0,157,44,SOLDIER,"Now, who else lives here?"
0,157,44,LEDA,"My husband did. He died last month from wounds suffered during the bombings. Please - I only wish to lead a simple life, as it is written in the ancient texts."
0,157,45,SOLDIER,Theres nothing here. Lets move.
0,157,46,KANE,"Once were close enough, well use the citys tunnel systems to get us near one of the bunkers access points. After were inside, well wait for Doctor Jacksons people to make their move, then we make ours. Understood? Lets hope your friends keep their end of the bargain."
0,157,47,DANIEL,If this works ...
0,157,47,LEDA,Youll be going home.
0,157,47,DANIEL,"Leda, I w..."
0,157,47,LEDA,No. Go.
0,157,52,AIDE,"Commander, several posts are no longer reporting in. Loyalist troops have entered from the surface and have managed to take several key sections."
0,157,52,SOREN,Then take them back.
0,157,52,AIDE,We cannot. Theyve co-ordinated an attack with help from the offworlders. We are losing control of the facility.
0,157,52,SOREN,"If youre suggesting that we evacuate, think again!"
0,157,53,KANE,Cease fire!
0,157,53,CARTER,"Daniel, you guys OK?"
0,157,53,DANIEL,"Yeah, were fine."
0,157,53,AIDE,All stations are dark. The loyalists have us surrounded. They are calling for our surrender.
0,157,53,SOREN,Engage them.
0,157,54,CARTER,Any chance hell just surrender?
0,157,54,AIDE,Commander. We are hopelessly outnumbered.
0,157,55,SOREN,Were all here for one purpose - to honour the will of our gods. In their names we rose up. In their names we purged the non-believers. And in their names we will die if necessary. We will not dishonour them with cowardice. Now engage them. Engage them! You question your faith? I will show you faith.
0,157,56,CARTER,"Drop your weapon. I said drop your weapon, now!"
0,157,57,KANE,Its over.
0,157,57,DANIEL,I hope so. You may have just made a martyr.
0,157,57,KANE,I had no choice. You can return to your world now.
0,157,57,DANIEL,Kane ...
0,157,57,KANE,What happened to us was not your fault.
0,157,57,DANIEL,I know. We made a promise and we intend to keep it. Well be back to help you rebuild.
0,157,58,CARTER,"Daniel, are you ready to go home?"
0,157,58,DANIEL,Yeah.
