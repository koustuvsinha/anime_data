0,159,1,THUG,What the hell were you doin?!
0,159,1,YOUNG MAN,I was trying to park.
0,159,1,THUG,"Did you ever hear of signalling, pal?"
0,159,1,YOUNG MAN,I did signal.
0,159,1,THUG,"Listen, man, if you dont know how to drive, maybe you should try stayin off the damn road!"
0,159,1,YOUNG MAN,"Well, maybe if you hadnt been tailgatin me, this wouldnta happened."
0,159,2,THUG,"Oh, no, you didnt just say that!"
0,159,2,YOUNG MAN,"Look, man, I dont want any trouble."
0,159,2,THUG,Too late.
0,159,2,TEALC,This is unlawful behaviour.
0,159,2,THUG,Who the hell are you?
0,159,2,TEALC,Collision procedure dictates that you exchange insurance information and if necessary notify the police.
0,159,3,THUG,What?!
0,159,3,TEALC,"This gentleman did indeed signal , which would indicate that it was you who was at fault."
0,159,4,THUG,"Pal, youd better learn to mind your own damned business."
0,159,5,ERIC,Woh!
0,159,5,TEALC,I believe it will now be necessary to notify the police.
0,159,5,YOUNG MAN,Yeah. Thanks.
0,159,7,HARRIMAN,"Sir, uh, Colonel Kendrick from the Office of Special Investigations is here to see you."
0,159,7,ONEILL,Does he have an appointment?
0,159,7,HARRIMAN,"No, sir ..."
0,159,7,KENDRICK,"You wouldnt return my phone calls, sir."
0,159,7,ONEILL,I was busy; didnt think it was important - take your pick.
0,159,7,KENDRICK,"You know as well as I do theres been another incident. When you petitioned the OSI to allow Tealc to live off-base, your request was approved under certain provisions. These provisions have clearly been violated."
0,159,7,ONEILL,"Oh, come on, Colonel. If you had saved Earth from total annihilation a couple of times and your government told you you couldnt go out to play, wouldnt you consider it more a ... guideline than a rule?"
0,159,7,KENDRICK,"We all appreciate what Tealc has done for us, sir, on numerous occasions - but that doesnt change the fact that hes a liability, and every day hes allowed to roam around in public jeopardises national security."
0,159,7,ONEILL,"Oh, dont be so dramatic, Dick - itll give you gas."
0,159,7,KENDRICK,Either you take action to ensure these provisions are met or the OSI will.
0,159,7,ONEILL,Hey. Watch it. Ill look into it.
0,159,7,KENDRICK,"Yes, sir."
0,159,8,DANIEL,Hey!
0,159,8,TEALC,Daniel Jackson.
0,159,8,DANIEL,Just wanted to come by and see how youre settling in.
0,159,8,TEALC,Please enter.
0,159,8,DANIEL,"Wow - I like what youre doin with the place - sort of, um, Jaffa chic with, er, East African flair."
0,159,8,TEALC,I have discovered there are many programmes on television which offer advice in the area of home design and decoration.
0,159,8,DANIEL,"Yeah, Im a little more into the History Channel myself."
0,159,8,TEALC,Can I offer you anything?
0,159,8,DANIEL,"No, Im fine. Um, hows the fern doin? Dont suppose youve tried talking to it."
0,159,8,TEALC,I have not. Perhaps you should tell me why you are here.
0,159,8,DANIEL,"A guy just cant come by and visit his friend? Yep - I heard what happened the other day. Three KOs, first round."
0,159,8,TEALC,ONeill sent you to speak with me.
0,159,8,DANIEL,No ... yeah.
0,159,8,TEALC,I broke no law. I intervened to prevent a criminal activity and was forced to defend myself.
0,159,8,DANIEL,"You see, thats kind of the point. Look, theres no reason why you shouldnt be allowed to live off-base, I mean, especially when youre not carrying a symbiont any more, but - youre supposed to be keeping a low profile."
0,159,8,TEALC,That is not always easy.
0,159,8,DANIEL,"Yeah, Im not just talking about the tattoo, although I do see how that could be a problem."
0,159,8,TEALC,I often cover it to avoid stares in public but I tell those who have seen it that it is a tribal mark from my home land.
0,159,8,DANIEL,"Yes, this is less about appearance than it is about behaviour."
0,159,8,TEALC,Have I not conducted myself as a typical member of this community?
0,159,8,DANIEL,"No - no, actually, no, you havent. Um, besides the other day, there was the incident with the old man and the teenagers in the park; there was that thing with the guy with the pit-bull"
0,159,8,TEALC,"In each case, I was only attempting to render assistance where it was needed."
0,159,8,DANIEL,"See, thats kind of the problem. Um, normally human beings are a little more ... careful about getting involved in business that isnt theirs. I know - that sounds bad but its just the way it is and, um, you cant afford to be drawing attention to yourself."
0,159,8,TEALC,I understand. Excuse me.
0,159,8,KRISTA,Hi.
0,159,8,TEALC,Krista.
0,159,8,KRISTA,Made you cookies.
0,159,8,TEALC,Please come in.
0,159,8,KRISTA,Im sorry - I didnt realise you had company.
0,159,8,TEALC,"Krista James, this is Daniel Jackson."
0,159,8,DANIEL,Hi!
0,159,8,TEALC,Krista lives in the apartment next door.
0,159,8,KRISTA,Wait a minute - Doctor Jackson? Youre the archaeologist who hired Tealc to come over from Mozambique.
0,159,8,DANIEL,Thats right!
0,159,8,KRISTA,"Well, then I should thank you. Its been great having him here. Its nice to have a man around who cares about his neighbours."
0,159,8,DANIEL,"Actually, we were just talking about that."
0,159,8,KRISTA,"In fact, thats why Im here. The cookies were a bribe. My pipes are doing that thing again."
0,159,8,TEALC,Normally I would be happy to provide assistance. However ...
0,159,8,DANIEL,"Nonononono - no, dont-dont let me interrupt - Ive gotta be going anyway, so, um ... Its very nice to meet you."
0,159,8,KRISTA,Nice to meet you.
0,159,8,DANIEL,"Uh, Tealc, that other thing we were talking about, um - every rule has its exceptions."
0,159,9,PETE,So - how are things in the galaxy?
0,159,9,CARTER,You know I cant talk about work.
0,159,9,PETE,Sorry - Im still getting used to the fact that my girlfriends a super-hero.
0,159,9,CARTER,Bit of an exaggeration.
0,159,9,PETE,The super-hero part or the girlfriend part? You travel to other planets to do battle with alien creatures bent on galactic domination. Just because you dont wear a tight spandex outfit doesnt mean that youre not ... although - its an idea you might wanna consider.
0,159,10,CARTER,"Look, I know this is hard for you. I mean, any other guy would have just freaked out and run away."
0,159,10,PETE,"You didnt run away when I stalked you. Anyway, I just want you to appreciate the position Im in here."
0,159,10,CARTER,"I do, believe me. And Im really glad you stuck around."
0,159,10,PETE,"Im glad to hear you say that, because I put in for a transfer to Colorado Springs PD."
0,159,11,CARTER,Are you sure?
0,159,11,PETE,Ive never been more sure of anything in my entire life. Thats why I got you this.
0,159,11,CARTER,Oh my God.
0,159,12,KRISTA,Im sorry to keep asking you to help with my plumbing but the supers never around and my boyfriends not very handy.
0,159,12,TEALC,There is no need to apologise.
0,159,12,KRISTA,"Anyhow, youll forgive me once youve tasted my lasagne."
0,159,12,TEALC,I am looking forward to it.
0,159,12,ERIC,"Yo, T!"
0,159,12,TEALC,"Greetings, Eric."
0,159,12,ERIC,I saw you take out those three gorillas the other day. Nice work!
0,159,12,TEALC,In retrospect it may have been unwise to intervene.
0,159,12,ERIC,Are you kidding? They deserved it.
0,159,13,WOMAN,"Hey! Hey, stop that guy, hes got my purse! Hey!"
0,159,14,ERIC,Arent you gonna do anything?
0,159,14,TEALC,I must not intervene.
0,159,14,ERIC,What?! Youre just gonna let him get away?
0,159,15,ERIC,"Oh-ho-ho, man! What a shot!"
0,159,15,KRISTA,How did you do that?
0,159,15,ERIC,"You the man, T!"
0,159,15,WOMAN,Thank you! That was amazing.
0,159,15,KRISTA,That was amazing!
0,159,15,ERIC,"T-money, you are the man! Gotta give the man his cross."
0,159,17,DOUG,"Krista! Krista! Cmon, Krista! Listen, listen, just let me in."
0,159,18,KRISTA,"Doug, I have to work tomorrow."
0,159,18,DOUG,So?
0,159,18,KRISTA,"So, youre drunk. Just go home, please."
0,159,19,DOUG,"No, no, no, honey, I aint goin nowhere."
0,159,19,KRISTA,Thats ...
0,159,19,TEALC,Is there a problem?
0,159,19,DOUG,"Oh, this-this is a private conversation."
0,159,19,TEALC,"If it were private you would not be conducting it in the hallway, nor speaking so loudly."
0,159,20,KRISTA,"Its alright, Mrs Conners - just go back inside."
0,159,21,TEALC,Do you require assistance?
0,159,21,KRISTA,"No, Im OK."
0,159,21,DOUG,Who the hell is this guy?
0,159,21,KRISTA,His name is Tealc - hes my neighbour.
0,159,21,DOUG,Tealc. What kind of a crazy name is that?
0,159,21,KRISTA,He just moved here from Mozambique.
0,159,21,DOUG,Oh. No doubt.
0,159,21,TEALC,Krista has requested that you leave. I suggest you comply.
0,159,21,DOUG,Youd better check yourself before you get hurt.
0,159,21,TEALC,"I have checked. I suggest you leave, before it is you that gets hurt."
0,159,21,KRISTA,Doug - go sober up.
0,159,21,DOUG,You know what? Im gonna call you tomorrow.
0,159,21,KRISTA,Im sorry about that. I hate when he gets that way.
0,159,21,TEALC,This is not the first time. So you have stopped receiving him.
0,159,21,KRISTA,Not exactly. Hes not always like that. Since he lost his job hes just been ... yknow.
0,159,21,TEALC,I do not.
0,159,21,KRISTA,Its been hard on him.
0,159,21,TEALC,And has it not been hard on you?
0,159,21,KRISTA,Im fine.
0,159,22,TEALC,I do not understand Kristas behaviour.
0,159,22,DANIEL,Yeah - thats a common problem. Most cultures on Earth recognise it as a significant gap between the experiences of men and women. Among the Masai of East Africa each newly-wed man is actually required to wear his wifes clothing for a month as a way of gaining insight into her life.
0,159,22,CARTER,If only it were that simple.
0,159,22,DANIEL,"The point is, while rituals and customs may vary, almost all cultures put significant pressure on single adults to form bonding pairs. In ancient Persia, if a girl died a virgin they would go so far as to marry her corpse off before burial."
0,159,22,CARTER,Thats horrible!
0,159,22,DANIEL,The groom was usually quite well-paid.
0,159,22,CARTER,Its bad enough being on your own without every TV show and commercial and magazine ad trying to tell you how abnormal it is.
0,159,22,DANIEL,I think thats what I just said.
0,159,22,CARTER,"I mean, they make you afraid of being alone but at the same time tell you not to settle for anything less than the perfect romantic ideal, like that actually exists anywhere in the real world. I mean, either way you cant win."
0,159,22,DANIEL,Hows things?
0,159,22,CARTER,"Good. We were talking about Tealcs friend, right?"
0,159,22,DANIEL,I thought we were.
0,159,22,CARTER,"Tealc, how do Jaffa couples handle their problems?"
0,159,22,TEALC,"On Chulak, a dispute between a man and a woman that cannot be resolved necessitates a pledge break. It must be requested by one and granted by the other."
0,159,22,DANIEL,And if that doesnt work?
0,159,22,TEALC,A weapon is required.
0,159,23,KRISTA,Sorry - I dont wanna interrupt you. I just came out for a little air.
0,159,23,TEALC,Are you alright?
0,159,23,KRISTA,I had another fight with Doug. I told him its over - that I dont wanna see him any more.
0,159,23,TEALC,Are you not happy with your decision?
0,159,23,KRISTA,"I guess it was the right thing to do, but hes not a bad person. Hes just going through a tough time."
0,159,23,TEALC,You have no cause to feel guilty.
0,159,23,KRISTA,What was that you were just doing?
0,159,23,TEALC,It is called loknel - an ancient form of martial arts training.
0,159,23,KRISTA,You think you could teach me?
0,159,25,KRISTA,"Oh, hi."
0,159,25,TEALC,You are late for your next training session.
0,159,25,KRISTA,"Yeah, I meant to tell you - I dont think Im gonna be able to train with you any more."
0,159,25,TEALC,You have been making tremendous progress.
0,159,25,KRISTA,"Well, I just dont have time, yknow?"
0,159,25,TEALC,Has something transpired?
0,159,25,KRISTA,"No, everythings fine. Look, Ive gotta go."
0,159,26,TEALC,You are injured.
0,159,26,KRISTA,Its nothing. Please.
0,159,26,DOUGS VOICE,"Krista, who is it?"
0,159,26,KRISTA,Its just my neighbour.
0,159,26,DOUG,"Oh yeah? Ah, the plumber, hmm. Ill handle this."
0,159,26,KRISTA,"Doug, its noth..."
0,159,26,DOUG,"I said, Ill handle it."
0,159,26,DOUG,Dont think I dont know whats been going on around here. She told me everything.
0,159,26,TEALC,Were you the one who injured her?
0,159,26,DOUG,What goes on between me and Krista aint none of your business.
0,159,26,TEALC,"If you ever injure her again, I will kill you where you stand."
0,159,28,ONEILL,Carter.
0,159,28,CARTER,Sir.
0,159,28,ONEILL,I never thought Id hear myself utter these words: I need that report.
0,159,28,CARTER,"Right! Um, I just need to, er, finish typing up my notes. Uh, yeah, Ill have it for you first thing tomorrow."
0,159,29,ONEILL,It is tomorrow.
0,159,29,CARTER,Oh.
0,159,29,ONEILL,Im joking! I dont need the report!
0,159,29,CARTER,"Well, then, why ...?"
0,159,29,ONEILL,Because somethings going on with you. You havent tried to confuse me with any scientific babble for the last couple of days and thats a red flag to me.
0,159,30,CARTER,Pete gave me this.
0,159,30,ONEILL,People normally wear these on their fingers.
0,159,30,CARTER,I havent said yes.
0,159,30,ONEILL,And yet - you havent said no.
0,159,30,CARTER,I told him I needed to think about it.
0,159,30,ONEILL,And?
0,159,30,CARTER,That was two weeks ago.
0,159,30,ONEILL,Ah!
0,159,30,CARTER,"Yknow, all these years Ive been concentrating on work - I just assumed that one day I would ..."
0,159,30,ONEILL,Have a life?
0,159,30,CARTER,Yeah!
0,159,30,ONEILL,Yeah.
0,159,30,CARTER,"And now it comes down to it, I dont know. I mean, every time we go through the Gate, we risk not coming back. Is it fair to put somebody else through that?"
0,159,30,ONEILL,Pete is a cop - I think he could handle it.
0,159,30,CARTER,What about kids?
0,159,30,ONEILL,What about em?
0,159,30,CARTER,"Do I take maternity leave and then come back? What, do I drop the baby off at daycare on my way to some unexplored planet on the edge of the Crab Nebula?"
0,159,30,ONEILL,"Carter, there are people on this base who have families."
0,159,31,CARTER,What about you? If things had been different ...
0,159,32,ONEILL,I wouldnt be here.
0,159,33,TEALC,Krista!
0,159,33,KRISTA,Hey - I was waiting for you.
0,159,33,TEALC,Has something happened?
0,159,33,KRISTA,"No, Im fine. Its just ... its over, with Doug - for real this time. Im sorry about what happened before. I need to get out of here. I cant even think in this place. Will you come with me?"
0,159,33,TEALC,Perhaps tomor...
0,159,33,KRISTA,"No, now, tonight. Well just get in the car and drive. Well take the whole weekend. It doesnt even matter where we end up, as long as its away from here. Please."
0,159,34,DANIEL,"Hey. What, uh, whats going on?"
0,159,34,CARTER,General ONeill just got off the phone with Colonel Kendrick. Kristas boyfriend was found dead in her apartment.
0,159,34,DANIEL,What?! What happened?
0,159,34,CARTER,"We dont have all the details yet but according to Kendrick, preliminary evidence indicates that Tealc may have been responsible."
0,159,34,DANIEL,Thats impossible.
0,159,34,CARTER,"Thats what I said. Unfortunately we cant ask him about it because hes missing. Sos Krista. As of right now, Tealc is wanted for kidnapping and murder."
0,159,35,KRISTA,Thanks for getting me out of there. I just couldnt be in that place tonight.
0,159,35,TEALC,Where do you wish to go?
0,159,35,KRISTA,Just keep driving. What? What is it?
0,159,35,TEALC,I do not wish to alarm you but I believe that we are being followed.
0,159,36,KRISTA,Who would be following us?
0,159,36,TEALC,Perhaps Doug.
0,159,36,KRISTA,No. He doesnt know Im gone yet.
0,159,36,TEALC,Then they are most likely following me.
0,159,36,KRISTA,You? Why would anyone be following you?
0,159,36,TEALC,It is difficult to explain.
0,159,36,KRISTA,Can you lose them?
0,159,36,TEALC,"I believe so. However, it will require me to violate posted speed limits and several of the safe driving regulations."
0,159,36,KRISTA,Im OK with that.
0,159,36,TEALC,Hold on.
0,159,37,KRISTA,Dont tell me you learned how to do that back in your village.
0,159,37,TEALC,There are aspects of my life which I am not at liberty to divulge.
0,159,37,KRISTA,What are you - a spy or something? One things for sure - youre not really Doctor Jacksons research assistant. That much I figured after about thirty seconds.
0,159,37,TEALC,"Krista, I ..."
0,159,37,KRISTA,"Its OK. For now, Im just glad youre here."
0,159,39,PETE,Hey.
0,159,39,CARTER,Thanks for meeting me.
0,159,39,PETE,No problem.
0,159,39,CARTER,"Pete, Im sorry. I need a little more time. Look, you know how I feel about you. Its just - theres some things I need to work out."
0,159,39,OK.,
0,159,39,CARTER,"Anyway, thats not what this is about."
0,159,39,PETE,Its not?
0,159,39,CARTER,No. I wouldnt ask if it wasnt so important.
0,159,39,PETE,Whats going on?
0,159,39,CARTER,I need your help.
0,159,40,TEALC,Krista? Krista!
0,159,40,SF,"Police! Turn around, lace your fingers behind your head."
0,159,42,KENDRICK,Well where is he being held?
0,159,42,ONEILL,Hes in his old quarters.
0,159,42,KENDRICK,Is he at least under guard?
0,159,42,ONEILL,Hes not going anywhere.
0,159,42,KENDRICK,Hes a murder suspect.
0,159,42,ONEILL,Yknow I talked to him. He said he didnt do it.
0,159,42,KENDRICK,"Thats good enough for you, is it?"
0,159,42,ONEILL,Pretty much.
0,159,42,KENDRICK,Well unfortunately youre not in charge of this investigation.
0,159,42,ONEILL,Yeah. He also said he felt like he was being followed last night.
0,159,42,KENDRICK,The OSI did not have Tealc under surveillance.
0,159,42,ONEILL,Yeah. Howd you find him?
0,159,42,KENDRICK,We received a tip.
0,159,42,ONEILL,That didnt strike you as ... odd?
0,159,42,KENDRICK,I told you something like this might happen - you flat-out ignored my warnings.
0,159,42,ONEILL,Not so much ignored as ... completely disregarded.
0,159,42,KENDRICK,"With all due respect, General, Im gonna have to insist that Tealc be placed in confinement immediately or I will recommend that he be held elsewhere."
0,159,43,DANIEL,What the hell?
0,159,43,DANIEL,Daniel Jackson.
0,159,43,VOICE,Did you get my message?
0,159,43,DANIEL,Who is this?
0,159,43,VOICE,"The symbols, Doctor Jackson, do you recognise them?"
0,159,43,DANIEL,"Uh, I dont know who you think this is ..."
0,159,43,VOICE,We need them translated into Goauld.
0,159,43,DANIEL,I have no idea what youre talking about.
0,159,43,VOICE,We know its the language of the Ancients but the dialect is obscure. Youre the one man on Earth who can translate them. Your friend Tealc is in trouble.
0,159,43,DANIEL,Howd you know about that?
0,159,43,VOICE,"We can help him. Weve been watching him. In fact, we saw the whole thing."
0,159,43,DANIEL,You witnessed the murder.
0,159,43,VOICE,"Weve got it all on tape - concrete evidence that proves Tealcs innocence, and its yours in exchange for the translation. Of course, if you tell anyone, well know, and the deals off."
0,159,44,PETE,The investigator who checked the position of the body concluded that the victim was pinned and choked against this wall and then fell to the floor.
0,159,44,CARTER,So ...?
0,159,44,PETE,So Im not so sure. The proximity of the body to the wall supports that but the position of the body suggests otherwise.
0,159,44,CARTER,What do you mean?
0,159,44,PETE,"If he fell into a slump, his legs and arms would be bent. His legs are straight, and his arms are placed by his sides, suggesting that the body was dragged here and placed in this position."
0,159,44,CARTER,Why move the body?
0,159,44,PETE,"Well, dying against the wall suggests that the victim was attacked by somebody bigger and stronger."
0,159,44,CARTER,Like Tealc. So it was a set-up?
0,159,44,PETE,"Its possible. Now, you said that Tealc thought he was being followed."
0,159,44,CARTER,Thats right.
0,159,44,PETE,The Air Force denies having him under surveillance?
0,159,44,CARTER,Yeah.
0,159,44,PETE,"If I was staking out Tealcs place , thats where I would be."
0,159,45,PETE,Hello?
0,159,45,PETE,From this vantage point you can easily see into both apartments. Three indentations.
0,159,45,CARTER,A tripod.
0,159,45,PETE,Unfortunately I think they cleaned the place up pretty good. I doubt well find anything.
0,159,45,CARTER,So its a dead end.
0,159,45,PETE,Not necessarily. Is there a pizza place nearby?
0,159,45,CARTER,Why?
0,159,45,PETE,One thing about a stake-out - you never eat healthy.
0,159,46,JENNINGS,Doctor Jackson. Keep walking. You came alone - Im impressed. I like a man who can follow instructions.
0,159,46,DANIEL,Youre the one who called me?
0,159,46,JENNINGS,It doesnt matter. Have you completed the translation?
0,159,46,DANIEL,"Yeah, see, thats why I wanted to talk to you - I need more time."
0,159,46,JENNINGS,"Youre playing with your friends life here, Doctor."
0,159,46,DANIEL,"I cant translate something unless I understand the context - where they were found, what theyre for."
0,159,46,JENNINGS,You think Im stupid.
0,159,46,DANIEL,Im not lying.
0,159,46,JENNINGS,I can see were going to have to do this the hard way.
0,159,46,DANIEL,What does that mean?
0,159,46,JENNINGS,"Either you give us the translation now, or Ill be forced to take this to the next level."
0,159,46,DANIEL,"So, beyond kidnapping and murder."
0,159,46,JENNINGS,We didnt kill the boyfriend - but well kill the girl if we have to.
0,159,46,DANIEL,How do I know you even have her?
0,159,46,JENNINGS,Come with me and Ill show you.
0,159,46,DANIEL,"Yeah - you know, Ive got a thing, so ..."
0,159,46,JENNINGS,"I have three snipers targeting your position at this very moment, Doctor."
0,159,47,DANIEL,Youre bluffing.
0,159,47,JENNINGS,Position one - go for the coffee cup.
0,159,48,DANIEL,"So are we gonna take your car, or mine, or, uh, shall I just follow you?"
0,159,49,CARTER,We checked a couple of pizza joints and all-night delivery places near your apartment to see if thered been any sudden repeat customers.
0,159,49,TEALC,An interesting investigative method.
0,159,49,CARTER,"Yeah - I thought it was a little crazy at first too, but we actually got a lead at one place. The owner reported a Caucasian male whod been in half a dozen times during the last two weeks."
0,159,49,TEALC,Is that unusual?
0,159,49,CARTER,Not necessarily but we thought it was worth checking out. We got a licence plate from the security camera out front and were running it down.
0,159,50,TEALC,ONeill.
0,159,50,ONEILL,"Well, Kendrick is finally convinced something else is going on here."
0,159,50,CARTER,What changed his mind?
0,159,50,ONEILL,Daniels missing.
0,159,51,DANIEL,"So you guys are ex-NID. You call yourselves The Trust now, right?"
0,159,51,JENNINGS,"We want the same thing you want, Doctor Jackson - were trying to protect the planet."
0,159,51,DANIEL,Thats why you were watching Tealc - you thought he was a significant threat to planetary security.
0,159,51,JENNINGS,Stargate Command may think its OK to let the alien roam the streets unsupervised. We beg to differ.
0,159,51,DANIEL,And never mind the fact that hes helped save the Earth more times than I can count.
0,159,51,JENNINGS,"He is an alien. Their motives can never be trusted. Anyway, he is partly responsible for the boyfriends death. If he hadnt shown the girl how to crush a mans windpipe, none of this would have happened."
0,159,51,DANIEL,So she killed him.
0,159,51,JENNINGS,"It was self-defence, really. He was getting out of hand."
0,159,51,DANIEL,And thats when you guys moved in and planted evidence to make it look like Tealc did it.
0,159,51,JENNINGS,We saw an opportunity and we took it.
0,159,52,HOSKINS,What the hells going on here?
0,159,52,JENNINGS,The situation is under control.
0,159,52,HOSKINS,You were supposed to get the information and leave.
0,159,52,JENNINGS,He wasnt going to co-operate.
0,159,52,HOSKINS,Hes a member of SG-1. Do you have any idea what kind of resources theyll mobilise to get him back?
0,159,52,JENNINGS,"Once we get the translation, itll be too late. Bring the girl."
0,159,53,CARTER,Carter.
0,159,53,PETE,"Sam, its me. I traced the car from the pizza place. Its a rental. The name on the agreements a fake I.D."
0,159,53,CARTER,Thats our man.
0,159,53,PETE,"Whoever set this up knew what they were doing. Ive got a bank account, social security number and credit cards, all from a guy who died six months ago."
0,159,53,CARTER,
0,159,53,PETE,Im on it. Ill call you as soon as I have something.
0,159,54,BROOKS,Uplink is established. Were ready to transmit.
0,159,55,HOSKINS,We need those symbols.
0,159,55,KRISTA,Daniel! Whats happening? Who are these people?
0,159,55,DANIEL,Its gonna be OK.
0,159,55,JENNINGS,"The symbols, now - or we kill the girl."
0,159,55,DANIEL,Shes got nothing to do with this.
0,159,55,HOSKINS,"Look, Doctor Jackson, if it had been up to me, things never would have gone this far. It was supposed to be a simple surveillance operation, but then this little domestic dispute happened, Tealc got involved, we knew you werent going to help us voluntarily ..."
0,159,55,DANIEL,So you decided to try a little blackmail instead.
0,159,55,HOSKINS,"Lets just say one thing led to another. But in any case, its too late for all that now , so either you give us what we want or I will kill her."
0,159,56,HOSKINS,"Oh, and by the way, well know immediately if the symbols are incorrect."
0,159,58,BROOKS,Scanning. Translating symbols. Translation confirmed.
0,159,58,HOSKINS,Good. Get up.
0,159,59,HOSKINS,Over there. Face the wall.
0,159,59,DANIEL,I gave you what you want.
0,159,59,HOSKINS,Move!
0,159,59,HOSKINS,I said face the wall.
0,159,59,DANIEL,"Look, you dont have to do this."
0,159,61,KRISTA,Daniel?
0,159,61,DANIEL,Its gonna be OK.
0,159,62,SERGEANT,Team two in position and ready.
0,159,63,CARTER,Go!
0,159,63,SERGEANT,Hes unconscious. Theres no-one here. Weve got all the exits covered - theres no way they could have gotten out.
0,159,63,PETE,How is that possible?
0,159,64,KRISTA,Thank you.
0,159,64,PETE,"So, its normal for the bad guys just to disappear into thin air, right?"
0,159,64,CARTER,Not really - although now I think about it its not the first time its happened.
0,159,64,PETE,Just another day at the office.
0,159,64,CARTER,Yes.
0,159,64,PETE,"Well, I figure you should be used to it by now."
0,159,64,CARTER,"No, I mean - yes."
0,159,64,PETE,"Yes, as in ..."
0,159,64,CARTER,Yes.
0,159,64,PETE,Are you messin with me?
0,159,64,CARTER,No.
0,159,64,PETE,Which means ...
0,159,64,CARTER,Yes.
0,159,64,PETE,You dont need more time?
0,159,64,CARTER,No.
0,159,64,PETE,Enough already?
0,159,64,CARTER,Yes.
0,159,65,TEALC,"Be careful with that package, Eric, its contents are ... ... fragile."
0,159,65,ERIC,Sorry.
0,159,65,TEALC,There is no need for an apology. I am grateful for your assistance.
0,159,66,KRISTA,Hey. So - youre really leaving.
0,159,66,TEALC,Indeed I am.
0,159,66,KRISTA,"Yknow, you dont have to do this. The whole thing was my fault."
0,159,66,TEALC,There is no need to blame yourself.
0,159,66,KRISTA,"The men in the warehouse - I didnt know who they were. No-one told me anything, but I know they were using me to get to you."
0,159,66,TEALC,If it had not been you it would have been someone else. They would not hesitate to exploit any relationship to their advantage.
0,159,66,KRISTA,What did they want?
0,159,66,TEALC,That I cannot say.
0,159,66,KRISTA,Right. So - where you gonna go?
0,159,66,TEALC,Back to where I came from.
0,159,66,KRISTA,What does that mean?
0,159,66,TEALC,It means I must say goodbye.
0,159,66,ERIC,This is all that was left.
0,159,66,TEALC,Thank you.
0,159,66,ERIC,Check it out.
0,159,66,TEALC,I am honoured.
0,159,66,ERIC,"Later, T."
