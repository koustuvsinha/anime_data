0,164,1,DANIEL,"Cmon, Jack!"
0,164,1,ONEILL,"Still no, Daniel!"
0,164,1,DANIEL,It doesnt even have to be on a permanent basis!
0,164,1,ONEILL,I didnt let you go in the first place - what makes you think Im gonna change my mind?
0,164,1,DANIEL,Because ...
0,164,1,ONEILL,Can you try to do better than that?
0,164,1,DANIEL,Because theyre gonna need somebody who can translate Ancient - Im the most qualified person left on the planet for the mission.
0,164,1,ONEILL,Which is exactly why youre gonna stay right here.
0,164,1,DANIEL,Because Ill quit!
0,164,1,ONEILL,Why dont you just hold your breath? You havent done that in a while.
0,164,2,ONEILL,General!
0,164,2,HAMMOND,Jack. I let myself in - hope you dont mind.
0,164,2,ONEILL,Absolutely not! Welcome.
0,164,2,HAMMOND,Thank you.
0,164,2,ONEILL,Miss the chair?
0,164,2,HAMMOND,"Actually, I do."
0,164,2,ONEILL,Want it back?
0,164,2,HAMMOND,"As a matter of fact, I do. My new one just isnt the same."
0,164,2,ONEILL,Thats not exactly what I meant.
0,164,2,HAMMOND,Doctor Jackson - nice to see you again.
0,164,2,DANIEL,"Likewise. We miss you around here, sir. So, to what do we owe this pleasure?"
0,164,2,HAMMOND,I came to ask if youd be interested in joining the mission to Atlantis.
0,164,2,ONEILL AND DANIEL,You did?
0,164,2,HAMMOND,"Hes the most qualified person on this planet, and the mission commander needs someone who can translate Ancient."
0,164,3,DANIEL,Really?!
0,164,3,ONEILL,"With all due respect, sir, I think you should tell the mission commander that I need Daniel right here."
0,164,3,HAMMOND,You just did.
0,164,3,ONEILL,"I did ... I did? You, sir?"
0,164,3,HAMMOND,"Yes. Request denied. Doctor Jackson, youre with me. Ill have the chair shipped to Washington. You can requisition a new one."
0,164,3,ONEILL,"Ill do that, sir."
0,164,3,HAMMOND,"We leave tomorrow. Oh, and Ill be taking Walter too."
0,164,5,DANIEL,General!
0,164,5,HAMMOND,Welcome aboard!
0,164,5,DANIEL,"Thank you, sir - again."
0,164,5,HAMMOND,"My motives were purely selfish, Doctor Jackson. We havent heard a word from the Atlantis expedition team since they first left. We have no idea what were going to find in Pegasus. Your knowledge and expertise will no doubt prove invaluable."
0,164,5,DANIEL,"General, if you dont mind my asking"
0,164,5,HAMMOND,Why am I going?
0,164,5,DANIEL,"Well, you couldve chosen anyone to command this mission."
0,164,5,HAMMOND,"Yknow, I sat back and watched you people go on a lot of adventures over the years."
0,164,5,DANIEL,"Its just that I thought that, when you were replaced at the SGC, you were sort of bucking for retirement."
0,164,5,HAMMOND,And then I led Prometheus against Anubis fleet.
0,164,5,DANIEL,Got your dander up!
0,164,5,HAMMOND,"Thats why I took the job as Head of Homeworld Security - and then this opportunity came along. Well, the President put me in charge, so I could choose anyone I wanted to lead the mission."
0,164,5,DANIEL,So why not choose yourself?!
0,164,5,HAMMOND,"Like I said, I sent a lot of people into action over the years. More than a few didnt come back. Id like to see this one through personally."
0,164,5,DANIEL,"Weve never left anyone behind, sir."
0,164,5,HAMMOND,And were not going to this time.
0,164,6,DANIEL,Last recorded MALP telemetry from Atlantis indicated an enclosed space with viable life support.
0,164,7,DANIEL,Now were going on the assumption that the expedition team found the lost city and was able to set up a base of operations there.
0,164,8,NOVAK,Sorry.
0,164,8,HAMMOND,Doctor Novak?
0,164,8,NOVAK,"The Asgard hyperdrive is functioning at one hundred percent, sir."
0,164,8,HAMMOND,Thank you. Doctor Jackson?
0,164,8,DANIEL,Im sorry - what-what was I saying?
0,164,8,NOVAK,"Oh, you were assuming the lost city is at the other end of this field trip. Please ignore me."
0,164,8,DANIEL,Its hard to.
0,164,8,HAMMOND,"You disagree, Doctor?"
0,164,8,NOVAK,"Well, as far as we know, the Atlantis team found another outpost like the one on Antarctica. It could be on a moon, or at the bottom of some deep, dark ocean."
0,164,8,HAMMOND,Which is why were going. If theyre trapped and need help ...
0,164,8,NOVAK,If theyre even alive at all.
0,164,8,DANIEL,"As for why theyve been unable to make contact with Earth, hopefully its just a matter of being unable to locate a viable power source."
0,164,8,HAMMOND,"Using information collected from the Ancient outpost on Earth, Doctor Jackson and his team have pinpointed our destination in the Pegasus galaxy."
0,164,8,DANIEL,Which is here.
0,164,8,NOVAK,Damn it to hell!
0,164,9,DANIEL,Doctor Novak.
0,164,9,NOVAK,Doctor Jackson.
0,164,9,DANIEL,Daniel.
0,164,9,NOVAK,"You can call me Lindsey. Um, sorry for contradicting you in the briefing."
0,164,10,DANIEL,"Oh, no, dont be. I mean, you were right - the fact that we havent heard from the Atlantis expedition since they left is a bad sign. Tried holding your breath?"
0,164,10,NOVAK,"Oh, God, Ive tried everything!"
0,164,10,DANIEL,"Yeah, it doesnt work for me either."
0,164,10,NOVAK,"Its been like this since I was a kid. It, er, it comes on when I get scared, but this is the worst its been since my PhD presentation. I mean, I dont really do well in stressful situations. I guess thats why I turned down going to Atlantis the first time."
0,164,10,DANIEL,"Well, Im sure youre gonna be fine. General Hammond says youre, er, youre very good at what you do, so ..."
0,164,10,NOVAK,"Oh, thank you!"
0,164,10,NOVAK,Whats that? Whats wrong?
0,164,10,DANIEL,I dont know.
0,164,11,HAMMOND,Were picking up what sounds like a distress call.
0,164,11,DANIEL,Where are we?
0,164,11,HARRIMAN,Were still well inside the Milky Way.
0,164,11,HAMMOND,Play it back.
0,164,11,HARRIMAN,"Yes, sir."
0,164,11,WOMANS VOICE,"Help ... require assistance ... have failed ... lost power to ... Repeat, stranded in ..."
0,164,11,DANIEL,She sounds human.
0,164,11,HAMMOND,What do you think?
0,164,11,DANIEL,"Well, as much as I hate to delay this trip, I think we have to check it out."
0,164,11,HAMMOND,How far away is it?
0,164,11,HARRIMAN,The message is originating just over fifty light years off our designated route. We could be there in ... twenty minutes?
0,164,11,HAMMOND,Set a course.
0,164,11,HARRIMAN,"Yes, sir."
0,164,12,HAMMOND,Set shields at maximum. Arm weapons.
0,164,12,REYNOLDS,Looks like an alkesh and a cargo ship.
0,164,12,HARRIMAN,Scans indicate theyve suffered significant damage. The distress signal is originating from within the alkesh.
0,164,12,HAMMOND,I dont understand. A human distress call from a Goauld ship - that makes no sense.
0,164,12,REYNOLDS,"I agree, sir. It could be a trap."
0,164,12,DANIEL,"Look, I know this looks suspicious but what if there was an uprising on board one of those ships? There could be human prisoners in need of our help."
0,164,12,HAMMOND,Open a channel.
0,164,12,HARRIMAN,"Yes, sir."
0,164,12,HAMMOND,This is General George Hammond of the Earth vessel Prometheus. Were answering your distress call and standing ready to assist you.
0,164,13,HARRIMAN,We can transport a portable sensor unit on board to determine life support viability.
0,164,14,REYNOLDS,"General - an alkesh is potentially a valuable ship. Even if there are no survivors, we need to determine if its spaceworthy. If it is, we should salvage her."
0,164,14,HAMMOND,Take a team.
0,164,14,REYNOLDS,"Yes, sir."
0,164,15,REYNOLDS,Prometheus - this is SG-3. We are on board.
0,164,16,REYNOLDS,"General, were seeing some energy weapon damage."
0,164,17,REYNOLDS,We have one Jaffa - KIA.
0,164,17,SG TEAM MEMBER,"Sir, over here!"
0,164,17,REYNOLDS,Make that four Jaffa. Looks like these folks had a little onboard fire fight. Still no sign of life. Were heading to the Bridge.
0,164,18,REYNOLDS,"Prometheus, someone just activated the ..."
0,164,18,HAMMOND,"Colonel Reynolds, say again?"
0,164,18,HARRIMAN,Sir! Our rings just activated.
0,164,18,HAMMOND,Security team to level four ring room. Visuals onscreen. Seal it off.
0,164,18,HARRIMAN,"Controls are not responding, sir."
0,164,19,REYNOLDS,Airman.
0,164,19,AIRMAN,"Its no good, sir. The rings will not activate."
0,164,19,HAMMOND,"Security team, report."
0,164,19,HARRIMAN,All shipboard communications are down.
0,164,19,HAMMOND,Initiate emergency lockdown.
0,164,19,HARRIMAN,"I cant, sir. It may be possible from the engine room."
0,164,19,HAMMOND,Go.
0,164,21,AIRMAN,"That wasnt me, sir."
0,164,21,REYNOLDS,Lets get em out of there.
0,164,25,HAMMOND,Can we pursue?
0,164,25,REYNOLDS,"Engines are offline. Controls are unresponsive. The weapons are offline too, sir. It looks like were dead in the water."
0,164,26,HARRIMAN,General. I just did a head count. Daniel Jackson is still aboard Prometheus.
0,164,27,DANIEL,"Oh, crap!"
0,164,28,HAMMOND,Are you OK?
0,164,28,NOVAK,"Oh, I feel like my heads gonna explode - but on the bright side, I think my hiccups are gone! What do you need, sir?"
0,164,28,HAMMOND,I need this ship operational - now.
0,164,28,NOVAK,"Yes, sir. Thank you."
0,164,29,HARRIMAN,"Near as I can tell, were lucky that the life support systems are still working, sir."
0,164,29,HAMMOND,How much time do you figure we have?
0,164,29,HARRIMAN,"Thats hard to say. Ive got some secondary systems online, including some short range sensors, sir. Scans of the cargo ship indicate that its in worse shape than this alkesh. Strange, isnt it, sir?"
0,164,29,HAMMOND,That a Goauld super-soldier would go to all this trouble to keep us alive?
0,164,30,DANIEL,"Hey, hows it going? Guess its just you and me, huh? Its a little strange, isnt it? See, that weapon I shot you with should have killed you. Whats even stranger is you guys usually dont take prisoners, either. I mean, its, uh, kinda kill first and ... No, thats generally just about it - just the killing. Im just gonna talk to myself here for a while, cos youre not gonna talk to me and ... Not that you guys are very talkative, but, uh ..."
0,164,31,SUPER-SOLDIER,You may prove useful.
0,164,31,DANIEL,
0,164,31,SUPER-SOLDIER,I transported them onto the alkesh.
0,164,31,DANIEL,"Well, you kept the wrong guy, cos I dont know anything about the ship."
0,164,32,SUPER-SOLDIER,But you are very attractive.
0,164,32,DANIEL,"What?! Hey, big guy, Im-Im flattered, really I am, its just that, uh, youre not my type. And Im more than a little disturbed that I might be yours."
0,164,33,DANIEL,"Woah, no, dont! You dont have to do that! Dont! Dont! Oh!"
0,164,34,VALA,Dont worry. Im not gonna hurt you.
0,164,34,DANIEL,Thank God.
0,164,34,VALA,Much ... I hope.
0,164,35,VALA,I wish to send a long range transmission using the communications systems.
0,164,35,DANIEL,"Sorry, dont have a clue."
0,164,35,VALA,You lie.
0,164,35,DANIEL,"In general? Uh, no. Yes. Well, I try to be honest but, you know, occasionally a little white one slips out every now and again ... Ah! Ow!"
0,164,35,VALA,Shall I kiss it better?
0,164,35,DANIEL,"Um, no. Just dont do it again. Hey, look, even if I knew what it is you wanted me to do, what makes you think Id tell you? How the hell do you think you can steal a ship when you dont know how it works?"
0,164,35,VALA,I got the sublight engines going.
0,164,35,DANIEL,"Yeah, so you did."
0,164,35,VALA,You really expect me to believe you dont know how your own ship works?
0,164,35,DANIEL,
0,164,35,VALA,No.
0,164,35,DANIEL,
0,164,35,VALA,I really dont care.
0,164,35,DANIEL,"Look, this really isnt necessary ..."
0,164,35,VALA,"Can I have this ship? No. OK. Discussion over. Oh. Here we go. Tennet OVoran. Tennet, this is Vala. If you can hear me, please respond. ... Ive managed to procure a vessel bigger and better than what I hoped for. Tennet, if you get this message, I apologise for the delay and will meet at the designated co-ordinates in one day. Vala out. Now, about the hyperdrive."
0,164,36,HAMMOND,Colonel. Doctor.
0,164,36,NOVAK,"Ive re-routed remaining power to shields and life support for the time being, but as far as the engines go ..."
0,164,36,REYNOLDS,The control crystals for both sublight and hyperdrive engines are totally fried.
0,164,36,NOVAK,Looks like they were deliberately sabotaged.
0,164,36,HAMMOND,Can they be repaired?
0,164,36,NOVAK,"In a word, no. We need new ones."
0,164,36,REYNOLDS,"I was thinking about that cargo ship, sir."
0,164,36,HAMMOND,Sergeant Harriman says life support over there is minimal - barely enough to sustain one person for a few moments.
0,164,36,NOVAK,And if we dont get new crystals ... sorry.
0,164,36,REYNOLDS,"Ill go, sir."
0,164,36,HAMMOND,"No, Ill go."
0,164,36,REYNOLDS,"Uh, with all due ..."
0,164,36,HAMMOND,"Colonel, someone took my ship. I want it back."
0,164,36,VALA,Access is restricted by a code.
0,164,36,DANIEL,Yeah? Too bad.
0,164,36,VALA,That hurt?
0,164,36,DANIEL,Uh! Yeah!
0,164,36,VALA,I can fix it.
0,164,36,DANIEL,I dont know the code!
0,164,36,VALA,There. Feel better?
0,164,36,DANIEL,Youre a Goauld.
0,164,36,VALA,. No - but I was once a host to one.
0,164,36,DANIEL,Which would explain the naqahdah in your blood that lets you use Goauld technology.
0,164,36,VALA,And how I can quickly learn to fly this rather primitive ship.
0,164,36,DANIEL,"Yeah, so primitive one would wonder if it was worth the bother."
0,164,36,VALA,"Well, in this case, its the size that matters. Actually, pretty much in every case. Tell me the code. Please."
0,164,36,DANIEL,Dont-dont know it.
0,164,36,VALA,Fine.
0,164,37,REYNOLDS,How much time will he have?
0,164,37,HARRIMAN,Im guessing a few minutes. Maybe less.
0,164,37,REYNOLDS,Sir ...
0,164,37,HAMMOND,"Not another word, Colonel. Do it now."
0,164,38,HARRIMAN,General. Godspeed.
0,164,39,NOVAK,"General? General, can you hear me?"
0,164,39,HAMMOND,Im here in the engine room.
0,164,39,NOVAK,Open the third panel down on the centre column.
0,164,40,HAMMOND,Done.
0,164,40,NOVAK,You want the blue one. It should be located at the centre of the panel.
0,164,41,HAMMOND,Got it.
0,164,41,NOVAK,"One panel up, you should find a clear one."
0,164,42,HAMMOND,Its hard to tell. The light in heres ... Somethings ...
0,164,42,NOVAK,"General, can you hear me?"
0,164,42,REYNOLDS,Its only been two minutes.
0,164,42,NOVAK,There was a firefight on board. If the life support is not cycling the air ...
0,164,42,REYNOLDS,What?
0,164,42,NOVAK,Staff blasts give off carbon dioxide. In a small enclosed space ...
0,164,45,REYNOLDS,General. General. Sir!
0,164,45,HARRIMAN,Is he breathing?
0,164,45,NOVAK,He may need mouth-to-mouth.
0,164,45,REYNOLDS,"Oh, excellent waking up, sir! Good job on the crystals, too."
0,164,46,HAMMOND,Get the ship moving.
0,164,46,NOVAK,What did he say?
0,164,46,REYNOLDS,"He said, Get the ship moving."
0,164,46,REYNOLDS,"Cmon, General, lets get you up."
0,164,48,VALA,Much better.
0,164,48,DANIEL,Lose the weapon - move away from the console.
0,164,48,VALA,I liked you better tied up.
0,164,48,DANIEL,Against the wall. Lose the weapon.
0,164,49,VALA,This suit will still absorb zat blasts.
0,164,49,DANIEL,What about your head?
0,164,49,VALA,"So, you should probably make me take it off."
0,164,49,DANIEL,I think well turn the ship around first.
0,164,49,VALA,"I dunno. If I had me at gunpoint, that wouldnt be my first choice."
0,164,49,DANIEL,"Yeah, well. Whats goin on?"
0,164,49,VALA,I rewrote the access codes so Im the only one who can use the navigation systems.
0,164,49,DANIEL,Undo it.
0,164,49,VALA,Listen - hundreds of lives are at stake. Im trying to save the last of my people and this ship is their only hope.
0,164,49,DANIEL,Maybe if youd mentioned that off the top.
0,164,49,VALA,Would you really have helped?
0,164,49,DANIEL,"Look, as I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, we were also on a rescue mission."
0,164,50,VALA,What is it?
0,164,50,DANIEL,A ship just appeared on our radar. Its an alkesh.
0,164,50,VALA,This quadrant is crawling with Goauld vessels. Chances are its not your friends. I made sure that ship was fully disabled when you showed up.
0,164,50,DANIEL,Well see.
0,164,50,VALA,We have to raise shields and arm weapons.
0,164,50,DANIEL,Im gonna try and hail them first.
0,164,51,VALA,Oh! Oh! Oh! You hit me!
0,164,51,DANIEL,You hit me!
0,164,51,VALA,"Yeah. You know, we could just have sex instead."
0,164,53,REYNOLDS,"Feeling better, sir?"
0,164,53,HAMMOND,"Yes, thank you."
0,164,53,REYNOLDS,We just caught up with Prometheus.
0,164,53,HAMMOND,Nice work!
0,164,53,REYNOLDS,"It was all Novak, sir."
0,164,53,HARRIMAN,"Theyre not responding to our hails, sir."
0,164,54,VALA,Are we done?
0,164,54,DANIEL,I am!
0,164,54,DANIEL,Youre a fruitcake!
0,164,55,HAMMOND,Weapons?
0,164,55,HARRIMAN,Online. We are in range.
0,164,55,HAMMOND,Target the rear thrusters. Take out her sublight capability.
0,164,56,REYNOLDS,She just jumped into hyperspace.
0,164,57,VALA,"Ow! Oh, thats just great!"
0,164,58,DANIEL,I see you!
0,164,58,VALA,Did you have fun taking off my clothes?
0,164,58,DANIEL,It was your idea.
0,164,58,VALA,"No, I meant when I was conscious - you know, so I could distract you and kick you in the head."
0,164,58,DANIEL,I kept my eyes closed the whole time.
0,164,58,VALA,Im sure you did.
0,164,58,DANIEL,"So, where we goin?"
0,164,58,VALA,I told you - to save my people. Can you please let me out of here?
0,164,58,DANIEL,"Ohhhhhhhhhhh, no."
0,164,58,VALA,"Yknow, I havent eaten in days."
0,164,58,DANIEL,Could you please tell me how to access the navigation controls?
0,164,58,VALA,"It isnt very nice, you know, starving a prisoner to death. Come on, Daniel, youve seen me naked. The least you could do is cook me dinner."
0,164,60,VALA,Arent you hungry?
0,164,60,DANIEL,No.
0,164,60,VALA,Thank you. You know the TokRa?
0,164,60,DANIEL,Yep.
0,164,60,VALA,"Ten years ago, a TokRa incited a rebellion on my planet. When people rose up against the ruling Goauld, and once the Jaffa had been overcome, the Goauld was captured alive, tortured, and beaten for days on end. I was host to that Goauld at the time. The people didnt understand that it was the symbiont that had ruled over them so harshly. I guess the TokRa felt responsible. He rescued me, removed the Goauld symbiont, nursed me back to health."
0,164,60,DANIEL,You said your people are in trouble now.
0,164,60,VALA,"Well, it was only a matter of time before the forces of another Goauld showed up - a System Lord named Camulus. Thats when the TokRa disappeared. People still refused to surrender; Camulus ordered that they be wiped out. We controlled several ships: troop transports, cargo ships, alkesh. Many people were saved, flown to an inhabitable nearby moon in the system. The ships made several trips before most of them were intercepted and shot down. Camulus never knew there were any survivors, so we were safe. Only problem was, the moon didnt have a Stargate."
0,164,60,DANIEL,So you were trapped.
0,164,60,VALA,We only had a few ships left - not enough to relocate everyone again. It wasnt a problem: Camulus seemed to have little interest in the other planets in the system. He left behind a small force to guard the Stargate. We used the ships to keep appraised of what was happening and to steal supplies and technology wherever we could.
0,164,60,DANIEL,You know that Camulus is gone now? He was beaten by Baal.
0,164,60,VALA,And Baals forces are searching every inhabitable world in Camulus territory. His ships are everywhere. Its only a matter of time before my people are found.
0,164,60,DANIEL,So you got desperate and tried to steal that alkesh.
0,164,60,VALA,"It was damaged in the firefight. I was hoping one of my ships would answer my distress call. Im sure you can imagine how lucky I felt when this ship showed up - its big enough to rescue all my people and take them to a world far away, free from the Goauld."
0,164,61,VALA,You dont have to lock me up.
0,164,61,DANIEL,"Uh, I think I do."
0,164,61,VALA,What difference is it going to make? This ship is automatically flying to my homeworld. You cant stop it.
0,164,61,DANIEL,"Well, when I get to your planet Ill just explain the situation to your people and maybe theres something we can work out."
0,164,61,VALA,My people - theyre not gonna trust you. You have to let me talk to them.
0,164,61,DANIEL,No.
0,164,61,VALA,Daniel! This is bad.
0,164,62,TENNET,"Vala, this is Tennet. We have you on our scanners."
0,164,63,DANIEL,"Uh, yeah. Hi!"
0,164,63,TENNET,Where is Vala?
0,164,63,DANIEL,Shes here; shes just ... indisposed at the moment.
0,164,63,TENNET,She did not mention she was working with someone.
0,164,63,DANIEL,"No, I guess not. Look, I realise I owe you an explanation. Its a bit of a long story, really."
0,164,63,TENNET,We will hear it in person and inspect your vessel.
0,164,63,DANIEL,"Thats good, cos apparently were coming in for a landing."
0,164,63,TENNET,We will meet you at the designated co-ordinates.
0,164,63,DANIEL,Okey-dokey. See ya there.
0,164,65,VALA,
0,164,67,DANIEL,"Hi, guys!"
0,164,67,TENNET,Who are you?
0,164,67,DANIEL,"Uh, the names Olo. Hans Olo."
0,164,67,TENNET,Where is Vala?
0,164,67,DANIEL,Shes inside.
0,164,67,TENNET,We will only do business with Vala.
0,164,67,DANIEL,"Business. Yeah. That figures. Not that Im surprised or anything. I dont look surprised to you, do I?"
0,164,67,TENNET,What?
0,164,67,DANIEL,Its just I was expecting some refugees in need of transport to another planet - human sort of refugees. Not that theres anything wrong with you guys that I know of.
0,164,67,SECOND ALIEN,We have the naqahdah.
0,164,67,TENNET,Refined weapons grade.
0,164,67,DANIEL,"Ooh, thats nice!"
0,164,67,TENNET,This was the price we agreed upon. This ship is impressive in size but we cannot
0,164,67,DANIEL,
0,164,67,TENNET,We had a deal! We must have this ship!
0,164,68,TENNET,Goauld gliders! Fool! You were followed!
0,164,68,DANIEL,"Of course we were! OK, you know what? Id love to stay and chat but ..."
0,164,70,VALA,Daniel? Whats going on?
0,164,70,DANIEL,Were being attacked by gliders. Tell me how to access the ships systems.
0,164,70,VALA,Let me out and Ill help you.
0,164,70,DANIEL,Youve gotta be kidding me!
0,164,71,DANIEL,Lets go. No funny stuff.
0,164,71,VALA,What did you do with my buyers?
0,164,71,DANIEL,"Oh, well talk about that later."
0,164,71,VALA,And the naqahdah?
0,164,71,DANIEL,Move!
0,164,71,VALA,"Do you have any idea what that is worth? Oh, watch out! Argh!"
0,164,72,VALA,"Alright, raise our shields."
0,164,72,DANIEL,What are you waiting for? Lets go into hyperspace.
0,164,72,VALA,I cant - its not working. Weve already taken too much hull damage. We have incoming - alkesh. Arm weapons.
0,164,73,VALA,Shields are failing.
0,164,74,VALA,Aft shields are down. We are almost out of weapons.
0,164,75,VALA,What just happened?
0,164,75,DANIEL,An alkesh just took out one of its own.
0,164,75,HAMMOND,"Nice work, Sergeant. Target the second alkesh. Fire at will."
0,164,75,HARRIMAN,"Roger that, sir."
0,164,75,HAMMOND,Doctor Jackson? This is General Hammond. Do you copy?
0,164,76,DANIEL,"General! Its me! Good to hear your voice, sir."
0,164,76,HAMMOND,"Likewise. You alright, son?"
0,164,76,DANIEL,"Were fine, sir."
0,164,76,HAMMOND,Are we clear to ring aboard?
0,164,76,DANIEL,Stand by. Unlock the system. Those gliders likely retreated to a nearby mothership. We have to get out of here now. Unlock the system.
0,164,77,DANIEL,"Youre all clear, sir."
0,164,77,VALA,Whatre you gonna do with me?
0,164,77,DANIEL,Im not sure.
0,164,77,VALA,"Look, Daniel, whatever happens, I just want you to know ..."
0,164,79,NOVAK,"We managed to get the shields and hyperdrive back online. However, there was significant hull damage. I wouldnt recommend a long journey in hyperspace."
0,164,79,HAMMOND,Im afraid we have no choice but to return to Earth.
0,164,79,DANIEL,How long before the ships ready to go again?
0,164,79,NOVAK,Hard to say.
0,164,79,HAMMOND,"Its good work, Doctor, both here and on the alkesh."
0,164,79,NOVAK,"Thank you, sir!"
0,164,79,DANIEL,"Hey! Hiccups are gone, huh?"
0,164,80,NOVAK,I didnt even notice! I guess I was having too much fun!
0,164,80,HARRIMAN,Security team to level four. The prisoner has escaped.
0,164,80,DANIEL,Ring room!
0,164,80,NOVAK,Wow!
0,164,81,HAMMOND,Status?
0,164,81,HARRIMAN,"Security Team One unresponsive. The rings on level four just activated, sir."
0,164,82,DANIEL,General Hammond? SG-3 was just transported here. Shes on the alkesh.
0,164,83,HAMMOND,Lock weapons on its engines.
0,164,83,HARRIMAN,Aft thruster is targeted.
0,164,83,HARRIMAN,Target is ...
0,164,83,HARRIMAN,"Its gone, sir."
0,164,83,HAMMOND,Can we track it?
0,164,83,HARRIMAN,"No, sir. Our long range scanners are being scrambled."
0,164,84,DANIEL,Shes good.
