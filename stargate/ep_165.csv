0,165,0,"""IT'S GOOD TO BE KING""",By Joseph Mallozzi & Paul Mullie Transcribed by
0,165,1,CARTER,"The war between Baal and the System Lords has reached a critical stage. According to TokRa intelligence, Bastet and Olukun are dead, Morrigan has capitulated, and Lord Yu and Amateratsu are rallying their armies for what will probably be their last stand."
0,165,1,TEALC,"As we predicted, the Jaffa were no match for the Kull warriors."
0,165,1,CARTER,"The TokRa also thought we should know, in the face of imminent defeat, some of the System Lords are actively seeking out areas of refuge. Planets they abandoned long ago are now being scouted as possible sanctuaries."
0,165,1,ONEILL,And this affects us how?
0,165,1,DANIEL,One of these planets which used to fall under the domain of the System Lord Ares also happens to be the place where the TokRa dropped off one Harry Maybourne two years ago.
0,165,1,ONEILL,And this affects us how?
0,165,1,CARTER,The TokRa have their hands full with more pressing matters. They strongly suggest we get to Maybourne before the Goauld do.
0,165,1,TEALC,"If we do not retrieve him, Harry Maybourne faces certain capture. Torture, interrogation - perhaps even death."
0,165,2,ONEILL,"Alright, fine. Go get him."
0,165,2,CARTER,"Yes, sir."
0,165,3,CARTER,According to the TokRa the people of this world are fairly primitive.
0,165,3,DANIEL,"No phones, no lights, no motorcars. I bet you Maybourne just jumps at the chance to leave."
0,165,3,TEALC,What of the other inhabitants?
0,165,3,CARTER,Well relocate them. We may not have a lot of time - Ares could be here in a matter of days.
0,165,4,CARTER,We dont mean you any harm.
0,165,4,TEALC,We are allies of the TokRa.
0,165,4,DANIEL,"Were just, uh, looking for a friend of ours - Harry Maybourne. Maybe youve heard of him? Shifty fella, beady eyes? No?"
0,165,5,GERRAN,You will follow us to the village and meet with King Arkhan. He will discern your true intentions.
0,165,6,DANIEL,Not exactly the trusting type.
0,165,6,TEALC,Which leads me to wonder whether Harry Maybourne is still alive.
0,165,6,CARTER,Presumably the TokRa put in a good word for him.
0,165,6,DANIEL,Maybe we should get them to do the same for us!
0,165,7,CARTER,Maybourne!
0,165,7,GERRAN,"This is King Arkhan. My Lord, our hunting party encountered these offworlders by the Gate."
0,165,7,MAYBOURNE,"Hey, guys! Long time no see!"
0,165,8,MAYBOURNE,I should have known. I should have known youd be the ones to come.
0,165,8,DANIEL,You were expecting us?
0,165,8,MAYBOURNE,"Well, sort of. Wheres Jack?"
0,165,8,CARTER,General ONeills back at the SGC.
0,165,8,MAYBOURNE,"No kidding. General ONeill? That doesnt sound right. Still, good for Jack. Nice to hear hes doing so well for himself."
0,165,8,TEALC,"As, evidently, are you."
0,165,8,MAYBOURNE,"Uh, this. Yes, well, uh, its a long story. Food, drinks for our guests!"
0,165,9,CARTER,We dont have time for this!
0,165,9,MAYBOURNE,"Uh, you should try one of these. Its called, um ..."
0,165,9,GERRAN,Ojun fruit.
0,165,9,MAYBOURNE,Right. Its sort of a cross between a guava and a mango.
0,165,9,DANIEL,Sort of a guango?!
0,165,9,MAYBOURNE,I like that! People! Henceforth ojun fruit shall be called guango! So shall it be! I get to name all kinds of stuff. You should see the Grateful Dead Burial Ground!
0,165,9,CARTER,"Maybourne, you have to get out of here. Youre in danger."
0,165,9,MAYBOURNE,"I know. The Goauld are coming. Now, you should peel it before you eat it. I find the skin kind of tart."
0,165,9,CARTER,You know about the Goauld?
0,165,9,MAYBOURNE,Oh yeah.
0,165,9,TEALC,You were warned by the TokRa.
0,165,9,MAYBOURNE,I havent heard from the TokRa since they dropped me off.
0,165,9,CARTER,Then how?
0,165,9,MAYBOURNE,I can read the future. Really!
0,165,9,CARTER,What are you trying to pull?
0,165,9,GERRAN,He speaks the truth. King Arkhan is a prophet. He foresaw your arrival and the hand you will play in defeating our enemy.
0,165,9,MAYBOURNE,Gerrans right. Its all part of the prophecy!
0,165,10,CARTER,"Maybourne, what the hell is going on here?"
0,165,11,MAYBOURNE,Lets go for a walk.
0,165,12,MAYBOURNE,
0,165,12,TEALC,It is quite a distance from the village.
0,165,12,MAYBOURNE,I enjoy long walks.
0,165,12,CARTER,"Right! Long walks, rainy nights, and candlelit dinners. Why are we here, Maybourne?"
0,165,13,DANIEL,This writing is in Ancient. What do the locals know about these ruins?
0,165,13,MAYBOURNE,"Well, not much. They generally avoid the area because its close to the naqahdah mines - the site of their former enslavement. Bad luck, an all."
0,165,13,DANIEL,This is incredible.
0,165,13,MAYBOURNE,"No, no, this is, uh, interesting. This is incredible."
0,165,14,TEALC,What is it?
0,165,14,MAYBOURNE,"Its a record of the planets history, covering major events. Only some of them havent happened yet."
0,165,14,CARTER,What are you talking about?
0,165,14,MAYBOURNE,"They have a complicated lunar calendar. It took me a while to figure it out, but once I did I realised there were references in the text to things that are gonna happen in the future. Yeah, I know - it sounds crazy. I didnt think much of it either at the time, but then this big meteor shower happened exactly on the date the stone predicted."
0,165,14,CARTER,Youre sure youre reading it correctly?
0,165,14,MAYBOURNE,"My skills may not compare with Doctor Jacksons but over the years Ive picked up a decent understanding of Ancient writing. As a result of my translations, I predicted a major flood would destroy the village unless I could convince the elders to move to higher ground."
0,165,14,CARTER,And of course you told them where these predictions came from.
0,165,14,MAYBOURNE,"No. Well, not in so many words. Look, these are simple people. This stuff would mean nothing to them. I had to play the role of a prophet to - to convince them."
0,165,14,TEALC,And out of gratitude they made you king.
0,165,14,MAYBOURNE,"Like I said, it was their idea."
0,165,14,DANIEL,"Well, hes partly right, anyway. It is a historical log. On the first moon of the forty-fifth cycle, the ground will tremble and devastation will be wrought."
0,165,14,MAYBOURNE,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, big earthquake, couple of years back - before my time. Skip ahead - were on the fifty-fourth cycle."
0,165,15,DANIEL,Commencing the third moon of the fifty-fourth cycle ...
0,165,15,MAYBOURNE,"Which is around now, give or take a few days."
0,165,15,DANIEL,... the oppressors of old will return
0,165,15,MAYBOURNE,Thats the Goauld.
0,165,15,DANIEL,... to seek dominion over the land. Those of a distant world will come ...
0,165,15,MAYBOURNE,Im guessing thats you guys.
0,165,15,DANIEL,... to vanquish the evil and restore order once again.
0,165,15,MAYBOURNE,"You see? They come, you defeat them, happy ending! Thats the prophecy!"
0,165,15,CARTER,"Sorry, but we didnt come here to fight the Goauld. We should get going."
0,165,15,DANIEL,"Actually, um, this is interesting, and, uh, theres a lot here to translate."
0,165,16,DANIEL,Sam?
0,165,16,CARTER,Go ahead.
0,165,16,DANIEL,Maybourne was right.
0,165,16,CARTER,What do you mean?
0,165,16,DANIEL,"Well, from what Ive been able to decipher, its pretty clear. The script on these walls is a historical log compiled by an Ancient who travelled through time to study the evolution of life on this world."
0,165,16,CARTER,"Daniel, we know the Ancients experimented with time travel but we have no evidence that they actually mastered it."
0,165,16,DANIEL,"Yeah, well, we do now. You see, to the best of my knowledge, these writings are only a couple of hundred years old, which means they were carved after the Goauld had already left."
0,165,16,CARTER,But the Ancients pre-date the Goauld.
0,165,16,DANIEL,"Right, so the only logical explanation is that an Ancient travelled to the future and then back to a time not too long ago."
0,165,16,CARTER,"I dunno, Daniel."
0,165,16,DANIEL,"There are references to the time travel device itself. Now, its described as being inside a small ship. Now if Im right, it may still be here. I think its worth a look."
0,165,16,CARTER,Alright. Were on our way.
0,165,17,CARTER,Daniel?
0,165,17,DANIEL,Go ahead.
0,165,17,CARTER,Weve been at it a while - are you sure its around here?
0,165,17,DANIEL,Just give it a little more time.
0,165,17,CARTER,"I hate to say it, Daniel, but we cant risk staying much longer."
0,165,18,CARTER,Im scrubbing the search. Fall back to the Gate.
0,165,18,DANIEL,Sam?
0,165,18,CARTER,"Daniel, we have no way of knowing when the Goauld will get here."
0,165,18,DANIEL,It could be days.
0,165,18,CARTER,And it could be hours.
0,165,18,TEALC,"Colonel Carter, Daniel Jackson. I have found something."
0,165,19,CARTER,It certainly looks like a ship.
0,165,19,TEALC,These appear to be flight controls.
0,165,19,DANIEL,So whats this?
0,165,19,CARTER,Could be the time device.
0,165,19,TEALC,It bears little resemblance to Ancient designs we have previously encountered.
0,165,19,DANIEL,"Well, judging from Maybournes wall, it must have worked at some point."
0,165,19,CARTER,"Well, Im guessing it must manifest some sort of energy field that encompasses the entire ship, allowing the traveller to literally fly through time."
0,165,19,DANIEL,I wonder ...
0,165,19,CARTER,Ah! Lets not touch anything just yet. Im kinda fond of this era.
0,165,19,DANIEL,
0,165,19,CARTER,"Well bring it back. Judging by the dimensions, it looks like it was actually designed to fit through the Gate."
0,165,19,DANIEL,
0,165,19,TEALC,This vessel appears to be relatively undamaged. The engine may yet be functional.
0,165,19,CARTER,This is Ancient technology. Wed need an Ancient to make it work.
0,165,19,DANIEL,Or someone close.
0,165,20,MAYBOURNE,Jack! Its great to see you. How longs it been?
0,165,20,ONEILL,"Oh, since that time you got us stranded offworld and tried to kill me."
0,165,21,MAYBOURNE,That takes me back! I guess congratulations are in order. You made general.
0,165,21,ONEILL,You made king!
0,165,21,MAYBOURNE,"Right, well, its not a contest."
0,165,21,ONEILL,Do you mind? These guys are torturing that ditty.
0,165,21,MAYBOURNE,"Right. Take five, guys! I, uh, taught em that expression."
0,165,21,ONEILL,Ah.
0,165,21,MAYBOURNE,"Im, uh, hoping that you can stay for a while, check out the sights, take in the culture. I want you to feel at home here."
0,165,21,ONEILL,"Harry, youre aware of the fact that this place is gonna be overrun by a gaggle of bad guys soon?"
0,165,21,MAYBOURNE,"Yeah, well, maybe."
0,165,21,ONEILL,"Right! Carter told me about this prophecy stuff. Its not gonna go down that way, yknow."
0,165,21,MAYBOURNE,"Oh, come on, Jack, youve defeated System Lords before."
0,165,21,ONEILL,No! Youve got to tell these people theyve gotta start packing. Well take as many as we can.
0,165,21,MAYBOURNE,I cant. I already told them youd save the day.
0,165,22,ONEILL,Lemme ask you a question. Did this prophecy mention anything about casualties - how many people would die in the fighting?
0,165,22,MAYBOURNE,Its not really that detailed.
0,165,22,ONEILL,Does it say anything about the king surviving at all?
0,165,22,MAYBOURNE,"Actually, theres, um, no reference to me specifically. I just assumed ..."
0,165,22,ONEILL,"Yeah. Dyou really wanna take that chance, Harry? Dyou wanna roll those dice?"
0,165,23,MAYBOURNE,"Its not gonna be easy to convince them, Jack."
0,165,23,ONEILL,"You can do it, Harry, youre the king. And remember - its good to be king."
0,165,24,ONEILL,Nice ride!
0,165,24,DANIEL,"Yeah, Ancients like to fly in style."
0,165,25,ONEILL,"Nice! Woo-hoo! Youre gonna have to help me out here, Carter. Got any quarters?"
0,165,25,CARTER,"Unfortunately I cant help you with this one, sir, youre on your own."
0,165,25,ONEILL,Fine! How do we know were not gonna end up back at the Alamo?
0,165,25,CARTER,"Um, well, for one thing, that was on Earth - but more importantly Ive separated the time device from the control circuits ... I think. Concentrate on powering up the engines."
0,165,25,ONEILL,Concentrate? Got nothin.
0,165,25,DANIEL,"Come on, Jack. Youve already proven that the Ancient gene you possess allows you to operate Ancient technology. Its no different than, uh, the device in Antarctica. Just ... focus your mind."
0,165,26,DANIEL,Good!
0,165,26,DANIEL,Not so good.
0,165,27,MAYBOURNE,"Tempus fugit, girls, tempus fugit. I sure collected a lot of stuff in only a couple of years. Guess Im a bit of a pack rat."
0,165,27,TEALC,When do you intend to address your people?
0,165,27,MAYBOURNE,"Im getting to that - its just ... Well, Im thinking about what Im gonna say."
0,165,27,TEALC,Perhaps you should consider telling the truth.
0,165,27,MAYBOURNE,Thats one strategy
0,165,27,TEALC,"Whatever you decide, we are running out of time. We must leave soon."
0,165,27,MAYBOURNE,"Yeah. I know. I know. No, no, just leave that. That stuff over there ..."
0,165,28,CARTER,The primary power source is depleted. We need to reroute the controls to the secondary output which was originally designed to power the time device.
0,165,28,ONEILL,Of course we do!
0,165,28,CARTER,
0,165,28,CARTER,Damn it!
0,165,29,CARTER,Im just not that familiar with Ancient technology. I need a little time.
0,165,29,ONEILL,"That is one thing I cant give you, Carter."
0,165,29,DANIEL,You cant be serious.
0,165,29,CARTER,"Sir, this technology is too valuable to lose."
0,165,29,ONEILL,"Carter, what do you want me to do? Call in reinforcements? Its not like were throwing down with a couple of Jaffa. Were taking on a System Lord and his band of merry bad guys. Inside and out, I want that thing gone."
0,165,30,GERRAN,"Surrender your weapons, or die where you stand."
0,165,30,ONEILL,"Oh, if I had a nickel!"
0,165,30,GERRAN,Lower your weapons.
0,165,30,ONEILL,I ... dont think so.
0,165,30,GERRAN,We will not allow you to take King Arkhan from us.
0,165,30,ONEILL,Good King Arkhan is a fraud.
0,165,30,MAN,Our king is wise. He is a seer.
0,165,30,ONEILL,"He may be your king, but hes no seer."
0,165,30,DANIEL,"He can only interpret whats been written on the pillars of the temple ruins not far from here. Now, those writings hold the prophecies, and anyone who can read them can make the same predictions."
0,165,30,GERRAN,That is a lie.
0,165,30,DANIEL,Why dont we just go back to the village and let King Arkhan explain everything?
0,165,30,GERRAN,First lower your weapons.
0,165,30,DANIEL,Jack?
0,165,30,ONEILL,Daniel?
0,165,30,DANIEL,Theyre not gonna shoot ... are ya?
0,165,31,ONEILL,"God, I miss goin offworld! Oh, yeah!"
0,165,32,ONEILL,Whoda thunk?
0,165,32,MAYBOURNE,"Oh, hey, Jack. I, uh, spoke with Gerran. I was sorry to hear about what happened at the ship. Believe me, I had nothing to do with it."
0,165,32,ONEILL,"I know, Harry, youre always the victim in these things."
0,165,32,MAYBOURNE,
0,165,32,ONEILL,"Oh, please!"
0,165,32,MAYBOURNE,"Its true, Jack. I care about these people. I wanna help them."
0,165,32,ONEILL,Then tell em the truth. Come clean on all this stuff.
0,165,32,MAYBOURNE,"Ive already arranged for an assembly with the, uh, village elders. Im gonna tell them we have to leave."
0,165,33,MAYBOURNE,"Well, here goes nothing. My friends. I wish I were here under better circumstances but the fact is, I come before you all to deliver a warning. The village is in danger, and the time has come for us to leave. We must abandon our world. Arrangements are being made to help us ... temporarily relocate to a safe place."
0,165,34,MAN 2,But the prophecy was clear. The enemy will be defeated.
0,165,34,MAYBOURNE,"Ah, yes, uh, the prophecy was clear, but only up to a certain point. After that it was somewhat, uh, unclear - uh, sort of, uh, murky clarity."
0,165,35,MAYBOURNE,"Of course the enemy will be defeated, but there is a chance that some of us may get hurt or even killed in the process, and I am not willing to ..."
0,165,35,MAN 3,Impossible! You assured us we would be safe!
0,165,35,MAYBOURNE,"Yes, I, I remember that. Uh, however ... The truth is, Ive not been entirely honest with you. I am not a seer. I dont possess insight into the future or divine powers that set me apart. Im just a regular guy, no more or less special than any of you."
0,165,35,MAN 3,But the prophecies!
0,165,35,MAYBOURNE,"The prophecies dont come from me. They come from the walls of the old temple, written in stone for all to see. I have the ability to interpret these writings and, with the proper understanding, any of you could do the same. I am a pretender. I took advantage of you and ... and for that I am deeply sorry."
0,165,36,GERRAN,What about the design for the new watermill? Was this written on the temple wall as well?
0,165,36,MAYBOURNE,"Uh, no, that was from me."
0,165,36,GERRAN,And our new medicines? Our legal code? The irrigation system? Were these things also found in the ruins?
0,165,36,MAYBOURNE,No.
0,165,36,GERRAN,"These were not the acts of a pretender, but of a leader!"
0,165,37,MAYBOURNE,"Uh, guys, Im touched, really."
0,165,37,GERRAN,"What does it matter where the prophecies came from? All we need know is that each one of them has been fulfilled, as this latest will be fulfilled."
0,165,37,MAYBOURNE,"Well, now, lets not get carried away here."
0,165,37,GERRAN,"We will defeat this enemy - and we will do so under the leadership of our great king, Arkhan the First! Arkhan! Arkhan! Arkhan!"
0,165,39,MAYBOURNE,"Uh, Jack. Look, uh, sorry about that."
0,165,39,ONEILL,"Not my problem, Harry. If these folks dont wanna go, they dont have to go. Tealc - you and Daniel head on back, secure the Gate. Carter - you and Ill take care of the ship."
0,165,39,MAYBOURNE,"Now, Jack, Jack, Jack, wait a minute. Uh, I know it sounds crazy, but Gerran was right about the prophecies. They have all come true."
0,165,39,ONEILL,"Harry, were not stayin - and if you wanna come with us, I suggest you get your royal butt to the Gate."
0,165,41,DANIEL,"Jack, come in."
0,165,41,ONEILL,Go ahead.
0,165,41,DANIEL,"Uh, weve got a little problem here. Ares Jaffa just came through the Gate. Were cut off. If you blow the ship now, youll give away your position."
0,165,41,CARTER,Guess were stayin for a while.
0,165,42,MAYBOURNE,"Welcome, strangers. I am King Arkhan the First. It is with a joyful heart and open arms that we welcome you ..."
0,165,42,TRELAK,"I am Trelak, First Prime to the great Lord Ares, your god, who will be returning to reclaim this land and his loyal followers."
0,165,42,MAYBOURNE,"Of course, of course. Glad tidings of comfort and joy ... comfort and joy."
0,165,42,TRELAK,Lord Ares demands nothing short of complete obedience from both you and your people. Any resistance will be dealt with harshly.
0,165,42,MAYBOURNE,Understood.
0,165,42,TRELAK,Gather your subjects. Inform them of our arrival.
0,165,42,MAYBOURNE,Of course. Ill address them immediately.
0,165,43,TRELAK,"Do you have something to say, slave?"
0,165,43,WOMAN,I am not a slave.
0,165,43,MAYBOURNE,I apologise. My servant spoke out of turn. She will be punished.
0,165,43,TRELAK,Of course she will.
0,165,43,WOMAN,"Kill me if you want, but know this: in the end, you and your people will be defeated just as the prophecy has foretold."
0,165,43,TRELAK,The prophecy.
0,165,43,MAYBOURNE,Pay no attention. Shes obviously frightened beyond reason.
0,165,43,WOMAN,It foretold of your arrival and of your defeat.
0,165,43,MAYBOURNE,"Another predicted rain today with a chance of morning frost, and yet what fine weather we are enjoying."
0,165,43,TRELAK,"Silence! Where may I find this prophecy? If what you say is true, then we would be fools to stay and meet our certain death."
0,165,43,WOMAN,It is written on the walls of the old temple.
0,165,44,TRELAK,Go with her.
0,165,45,DANIEL,"Sam, Jack, this is Daniel. Ares First Prime just sent some men out to check out the ruins. As soon as they see that Ancient writing, theyre gonna search the area."
0,165,45,ONEILL,Carter - hows it going in there?
0,165,45,CARTER,"Just a few more minutes, sir."
0,165,45,DANIEL,What are you guys doing? I thought you were going to blow it up?
0,165,45,CARTER,General ONeills given me one more chance to get the engines online so we can fly it out of here.
0,165,45,DANIEL,"Yeah, Im all for saving the ship but you could be kinda close."
0,165,45,CARTER,I know.
0,165,46,MAYBOURNE,"I have prepared a feast in your honour. Come! Please, sit, partake of our bounty. This fruit, for instance - its sort of a cross between a ..."
0,165,47,TRELAK,Im not interested in your offering. You were warned. Anyone who refuses to accept us will die.
0,165,47,MAYBOURNE,Youve made yourself perfectly clear.
0,165,47,TRELAK,"To you, perhaps, but your subjects seem less than willing to accept our terms. They cling to archaic beliefs - prophecies, portents - that threaten to undermine the rule of our god."
0,165,47,MAYBOURNE,That wont happen. I can see to it.
0,165,47,TRELAK,How?
0,165,47,MAYBOURNE,"Theyre simple folk, easily influenced. With my help, youll have no trouble bending them to your will."
0,165,48,WOMAN,Its here.
0,165,48,ONEILL,Dammit. Carter.
0,165,49,CARTER,Sir?
0,165,49,ONEILL,Theyre headed our way.
0,165,49,CARTER,I need more time.
0,165,49,ONEILL,"Yeah, of course you do!"
0,165,51,TRELAK,Those were Tauri weapons.
0,165,51,MAYBOURNE,Whats a Tauri?
0,165,52,ONEILL,Time to go.
0,165,53,TRELAK,Youre too late to save this world. Ive already received word. Lord Ares has just arrived.
0,165,55,CARTER,"Im done - I think. Were good to go, sir."
0,165,55,ONEILL,Im doing the best I can.
0,165,55,TRELAK,"What were you and your allies planning? Know this, sholva - Ill see to it that you suffer slowly."
0,165,55,TEALC,And I will see to it that you die quickly.
0,165,56,TRELAK,"I think not. My men guard the Gate, and the mothership descends as we speak."
0,165,58,TRELAK,You were plotting in concert with the people of this world. Treachery is something we cannot abide.
0,165,59,MAYBOURNE,I couldnt agree with you more. You think you feel outraged? Imagine how I feel - betrayed by my own people!
0,165,60,CARTER,"Sir, were detecting another ship. Its big."
0,165,62,TRELAK,Sholva!
0,165,62,TRELAK,You are a man of your word.
0,165,62,TEALC,Indeed.
0,165,62,CARTER,"Youre doing great, sir ... relatively speaking."
0,165,63,ONEILL,Weapons. Weapons.
0,165,64,CARTER,"Keep firing, sir."
0,165,64,ONEILL,Nothings happening.
0,165,64,CARTER,Weapons must be depleted. Hopefully you hit some vital systems.
0,165,65,ONEILL,Think that was vital?
0,165,65,CARTER,Relatively speaking.
0,165,66,ONEILL,You sure you dont wanna leave all this?
0,165,66,MAYBOURNE,"I cant abandon these people, Jack. I made a life here - I cant walk away from my home, my friends ... my wives."
0,165,66,CARTER,Wives?!
0,165,66,ONEILL,Go. Wives. Dog!
