0,17,0,"""TIN MAN""","By Jeff F. King SG1 arrive offworld. They are inside some sort of factory, or warehouse"
0,17,0,JACK,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is your Colonel speaking, welcome to P3X-niner-eight-niner, where it's a balmy room temperature. Fan out.Whoa,Well, the lights are on, but there's nobody home."
0,17,0,DANIEL,"The technology seems advanced by comparison, to what we've seen on most of the uman-inhabited planets. Maybe even more advanced then Earth."
0,17,0,SAM,Much more.
0,17,0,DANIEL,"Well it feels, older, somehow."
0,17,0,JACK,I know how it feels. This place has seen better days.
0,17,0,DANIEL,At least it doesn't appear to be of Goa'uld origin.
0,17,0,JACK,"Daniel:, ever run into something like this?"
0,17,0,TEAL'C,I have not.
0,17,0,SAM,A computer.
0,17,0,JACK,Well that sounds ominous! Fall back.
0,17,3,JACK,What the hell?
0,17,3,SAM,Colonel.
0,17,3,JACK,Carter.
0,17,3,SAM,How did we get in to these outfits?
0,17,3,JACK,I don't know. Welcome to PX3-989!
0,17,3,SAM,My transmitter's gone.
0,17,3,JACK,Daniel. Teal'c! You guys okay?
0,17,3,TEAL'C,I am well.
0,17,3,DANIEL,"Yeah, I'm fine. Better then fine actually, when you consider the fact that we were just."
0,17,4,HARLAN,Ah! Com-traya! Com-traya!
0,17,4,JACK,Daniel?
0,17,4,DANIEL,I think that's a greeting?
0,17,4,HARLAN,Yes it is.
0,17,4,DANIEL,"Oh! Well then,com-traya. We are explorers from a place called Earth. I'm Daniel, Hello."
0,17,4,HARLAN,"Oh! This is your custom, yes? Hello? You are the leader?"
0,17,4,DANIEL,"Oh, no, that would be."
0,17,4,JACK,"Me! Colonel Jack O'Neill, Kum by ya!"
0,17,4,HARLAN,Com-traya!
0,17,4,JACK,Whatever. Why did you attack us?
0,17,4,HARLAN,"Attack? Oh, attack, yes of course, it would seem that way from your perspective. Yes I did that!"
0,17,4,JACK,Why?
0,17,4,HARLAN,"It could not be helped! Oh! Are you suffering, any pain? Any after-effects? Or occasionally the heart must be restarted."
0,17,4,DANIEL,"Oh, no, I think we feel fine."
0,17,4,HARLAN,"Ah! Comtraya! You are all such wonderful specimens! You in particular, female!"
0,17,4,SAM,Colonel!
0,17,4,JACK,"Easy, Captain. Listen, we has some things, when we got here, some weapons."
0,17,4,HARLAN,"Oh those, yes, very dangerous."
0,17,4,JACK,"Very, can we have them back?"
0,17,4,SAM,And our uniforms?
0,17,4,HARLAN,"Sorry, but they are gone. This is better, yes?"
0,17,4,SAM,No.
0,17,4,HARLAN,"I am Harlan. I am the last survivor of, Altar."
0,17,4,JACK,Excuse me? The last survivor. You're the only one on this planet?
0,17,4,HARLAN,"Yes. And your weapons are, this way! We are in section three. There has been trouble here lately."
0,17,4,SAM,What kind of trouble?
0,17,4,HARLAN,Mechanical breakdowns. Very difficult to maintain this complex alone.
0,17,4,JACK,"Listen Harlan, is there an outside to this place?"
0,17,4,HARLAN,Outside is above. We are under.
0,17,4,DANIEL,Under the surface?
0,17,4,HARLAN,"Oh yes, under the surface, we could not survive. Mmm, radiation, very, very bad. Ah! This way to section four"
0,17,4,DANIEL,"Ah, what happened to your civilization? I'm sure you started on the surface and then moved under."
0,17,4,HARLAN,"Oh yes, long ago."
0,17,4,DANIEL,"We're curious to learn about other worlds and we'd love to hear what happened, on the surface."
0,17,4,HARLAN,All in time.
0,17,4,JACK,We've got all the time in the world.
0,17,4,HARLAN,"Yes you do. You understand, Comtraya!"
0,17,4,JACK,"Now what is that, Comtraya, is that like Aloha?"
0,17,4,DANIEL,"Harlan, how long have you been on your own?"
0,17,4,HARLAN,"Now, let's see, Wallis was the last one to go. I miss him. But you all remind me a little of Wallis! Except for you of course, you are, female.And you are, whatever you are. Hubald, he was the creator of all this. But he died very early, too early. Took many secrets with him, so long ago."
0,17,4,JACK,"How long, exactly?"
0,17,4,HARLAN,"Um, exactly? Ninety-nine million, two hundred seven thousand of your hours."
0,17,4,JACK,"That's 11,000 years."
0,17,4,SAM,How did you know that?
0,17,4,JACK,That's right?
0,17,4,SAM,Yeah.
0,17,4,DANIEL,"Wait, how did you know that?"
0,17,4,HARLAN,"See, everything is better, even your minds. You are all much, much better."
0,17,4,JACK,Better then what?
0,17,4,HARLAN,Do you not feel it? Are you not stronger? Smarter?
0,17,4,DANIEL,"I think he's right, I feel great!"
0,17,4,HARLAN,"Of course you do, because I have given you a great gift. I have made you all,better!"
0,17,4,JACK,Better how?
0,17,4,HARLAN,"Oh I have not hurt you, I have only made you, better!"
0,17,4,JACK,"Alright listen, listen closely, I'm going to ask you one more time very simply, better how? We're gone, were out of here!"
0,17,4,HARLAN,What
0,17,4,JACK,"Carter, dial us home. ."
0,17,4,HARLAN,Wait! You cannot leave! I cannot leave either. It is unsafe!
0,17,4,DANIEL,"What is unsafe, tell us!"
0,17,4,HARLAN,"All in time, there is so much you must know first."
0,17,5,HARLAN,You will be back! You will! You cannot leave me here all alone. Oh dear.
0,17,6,JANET,"Colonel, how do you feel?"
0,17,6,JACK,Never felt better in my life. It's got me a little worried actually.
0,17,6,JANET,"Yeah, well this has got me a little worried. Listen."
0,17,7,JACK,I don't hear anything.What this is better? I'm dead?
0,17,7,JANET,"Look Colonel, to make sense of this, I'm going to have to do a blood sample."
0,17,8,JACK,Oh God! What the hell is that? Get that out of me!
0,17,8,JANET,Look I'm going to need x-rays on all of them. Stat!
0,17,8,SAM,What did he do to us?
0,17,8,JANET,"I don't know, let's everybody stay calm."
0,17,8,DANIEL,s pouch is gone
0,17,8,TEAL'C,I no longer possess a Goa'uld.
0,17,9,SAM,"Colonel, what the hell are you doing?"
0,17,9,JANET,Colonel!
0,17,10,JACK,God!
0,17,10,JANET,Dear God.
0,17,11,JANET,Alert! Security to the infirmary!
0,17,11,DANIEL,"Whoa! Security! Dr. Fraiser, it's us."
0,17,11,JANET,"Just, don't come any closer."
0,17,12,JACK,"Stand down airmen, just a little misunderstanding. That's an order."
0,17,12,JANET,Belay that order. General that is not Colonel O'Neill.
0,17,12,JACK,"Oh for crying out loud, General, it's me!"
0,17,12,HAMMOND,Would you call that human blood?
0,17,12,JANET,"I have reason to believe they're all imposters. He, or whatever he is, has no detectable heartbeat."
0,17,12,HAMMOND,"Take them to the holding room, put a guard outside."
0,17,12,JACK,"General Hammond.I don't know what that son of a Bitch on 989 did, but I swear to God..."
0,17,12,HAMMOND,Follow the instructions
0,17,12,JACK,Your wife died of Cancer 4 years ago!
0,17,12,HAMMOND,And you will not be hurt!
0,17,12,JACK,Your granddaughters names are Tesea and Kayla!
0,17,12,HAMMOND,Any resistance made by any of you will be met with deadly force! Is that understood?
0,17,12,JACK,Understood. Perfectly.
0,17,13,HAMMOND,Looks and sounds like are people. They certainly believe they're SG1.
0,17,13,JANET,It may be another Goa'uld trick.
0,17,13,HAMMOND,"I don't know what to believe. He was right about the names of my grand children. How else would he have known, if he isn't Jack O'Neill?"
0,17,13,JANET,"Sir, given our history with the Goa'uld, I believe keeping them here would be extremely dangerous."
0,17,13,HAMMOND,"I'll take that under advisement, Doctor."
0,17,14,DANIEL,"It's incredible, it looks like mine, it feels like mine, it is mine, I mean I don't feel any different. If anything, I feel better!"
0,17,14,SAM,That's what Harlan said.
0,17,14,DANIEL,Well why didn't he just tell us?
0,17,14,SAM,Probably afraid we'd damage him.
0,17,14,JACK,Perceptive little runt.
0,17,14,SAM,"You know, Colonel, you can't blame General Hammond for confining us."
0,17,14,JACK,"Hey, I know who I am!"
0,17,14,SAM,So do I! In every respect I feel like Sam Carter.But the evidence.Harlan must have transferred our consciousness into these bodies!
0,17,14,JACK,"Bodies? Did you see the inside of this arm? We're machines, Carter."
0,17,14,DANIEL,Teal'c are you okay?
0,17,14,TEAL'C,Why?
0,17,14,DANIEL,"Well, for starters you've lost your Infant Goa'uld."
0,17,14,TEAL'C,I still feel it's presence
0,17,14,DANIEL,Really? That must be like continuing to feel a limb after it's been lost.
0,17,14,JACK,"Oh for crying out loud, Daniel! I'm glad you're so fascinated by all this, but it's time for a little reality check, okay? We are being help prisoner by our own people."
0,17,14,DANIEL,Well they can't hold us in here forever. I mean.
0,17,14,JACK,Why not? What do you think is going to happen? You really think military intelligence is going to let us continue as SG-1 like this?
0,17,14,DANIEL,We still have our rights Jack.
0,17,14,JACK,What rights are you talking about?
0,17,14,SAM,"Colonel, no matter what he's done to us, were still."
0,17,14,JACK,Human? Is that what you were going to say?
0,17,14,SAM,Harlan said we'd be back. Now we know why.
0,17,15,HAMMOND,Colonel O'Neill? Or whoever you are. I have decided to send SG-5 back to P3X-080. See if they can shed some light on this.
0,17,15,JACK,That's a mistake.
0,17,15,HAMMOND,Why?
0,17,15,JACK,Because old Harlan will do to them what he did to us.
0,17,15,HAMMOND,Harlan?
0,17,15,DANIEL,The indigenous person we encountered on the other side.
0,17,15,SAM,We believe he transferred out conciseness into these artificial bodies.
0,17,15,HAMMOND,Why would anyone do that?
0,17,15,DANIEL,"Well he thought he was doing us a favor. He thinks this is...better. And I never even really thought of it at the time, but he must be artificial too."
0,17,15,SAM,"That must explain how he got to be 11,000 years old."
0,17,15,HAMMOND,What?
0,17,15,JACK,General... I think it's imperative that we go back.
0,17,16,HAMMOND,Get Dr. Fraiser!
0,17,16,AIRMAN,Yes sir!
0,17,16,JACK,"General, we've got to go back."
0,17,17,HAMMOND,We'll send another team through within the hour!
0,17,17,JACK,Negative. Don't risk any more.
0,17,17,HAMMOND,Get this gate open!
0,17,17,HARRIMAN,Stand by.
0,17,18,TEAL'C,My strength returns.
0,17,18,SAM,We ran out of energy.
0,17,18,DANIEL,What?
0,17,18,SAM,"Well if these bodies are machines, they need a power source. It's here."
0,17,18,HARLAN,"Ah, Comtraya! Here is where you belong now. Here is the only place you can be."
0,17,18,JACK,You son of a bitch!
0,17,18,HARLAN,You nearly waited too long. I was worried. Feel better?
0,17,18,JACK,Better. What the hell did you do to us?
0,17,18,HARLAN,You are angry.
0,17,18,JACK,Yes. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't break you in half.
0,17,18,SAM,"Colonel, he's the only one who can put our consciousness back into our real bodies."
0,17,18,HARLAN,"Oh no, no, no, I cannot do that. In time you will see, I have transferred your consciousness into the synthetic."
0,17,18,JACK,Well transfer us back! Now!
0,17,18,HARLAN,"Oh, I cannot, it is permanent."
0,17,18,JACK,I do not want to hear that!
0,17,18,HARLAN,You are damaging me.
0,17,19,HARLAN,"I am sorry, but there is no way to do what you ask. Your bodies are all gone; it is all part of the process. This is what you are now. You will see. It is better."
0,17,20,HARLAN,"This way. Around the corner, just a few more steps and home again! You should rest now. Your internal systems are not yet fully recharged, and they were allowed to drain far too low."
0,17,21,HARLAN,"Section 2, you see now why I needed you? This place is more then one man can maintain! Oh, so much to do. You will see, you will all feel much better soon. Oh, this will not take long at all."
0,17,21,DANIEL,"Jack, he said we should rest. We don't want to run out of energy again."
0,17,21,SAM,"He's right about this place, half of this complex isn't working. The rest is marginal I mean, look around. He's been a jerry-rigging thing's for centuries. He was desperate."
0,17,21,JACK,I say let this place fall down.
0,17,21,TEAL'C,"To condemn Harlan, would be to condemn ourselves."
0,17,21,JACK,Your point being?
0,17,21,TEAL'C,What is done is done.
0,17,21,JACK,Oh please. Has it occurred to anyone that all we are now is robots?
0,17,21,DANIEL,Where are you going?
0,17,21,JACK,I'm going to find Harlan.
0,17,21,DANIEL,Jack!
0,17,21,JACK,"Don't worry, it's just to talk. Robot to robot."
0,17,22,SAM,What?
0,17,22,DANIEL,"Oh it's nothing.This notion of living a 11,000 years entered my mind for a moment and I couldn't, it's a lot to take in."
0,17,22,SAM,Apparently we've got time to adjust. We really do have all the same sensations and perceptions that we did in our human form.
0,17,22,DANIEL,"Well, if you think about it, the human body is just a machine. It's a vessel for our conciseness, I mean; it's just an organic one. It performs work requires fuel."
0,17,22,SAM,"It's not the same, Daniel."
0,17,22,DANIEL,"No it isn't, but maybe in a way Harlan was right, maybe in a way this is better. I mean we're still us, we're still unique. Every thought, every feeling"
0,17,22,SAM,"Have you felt hungry, or thirsty since this happened?"
0,17,22,DANIEL,No! Teal'c You still okay?
0,17,23,DANIEL,Where did he go?
0,17,23,SAM,Probably wants to be alone. I don't blame him.That way.
0,17,25,HARLAN,I do not understand this obsession of yours.
0,17,25,JACK,It's not an obsession. I just want to know what you did with out bodies.
0,17,25,HARLAN,You have no further use for them.
0,17,26,HARLAN,"Oh good, you are exploring, yes good, well there is much to see, much to learn from the station. And you are feeling better. Yes?"
0,17,26,SAM,"No. Colonel, have you seen Teal'c?"
0,17,26,JACK,I left him with you.
0,17,26,HARLAN,Perhaps he is best left alone. He is different. Yes?
0,17,26,JACK,"Yes. Look Harlan, I want to know why you did this, why you did all of this."
0,17,26,HARLAN,"Our race was facing destruction. The biosphere of this planet could no longer support us. This project was under taken to allow some of our people to continue to live, even if the planet could not. Our former bodies, would, who, never survive this."
0,17,26,SAM,"How many were there, originally?"
0,17,26,HARLAN,A thousand.
0,17,26,DANIEL,What happened to them.
0,17,26,HARLAN,"Oh, there were problems with he transfer process. Some were lost. Sekara, Bareth, Tira, very, very sad. We could not repair Hubald, creator of all this! His secrets were lost. But many survived for a while."
0,17,26,SAM,Where are they?
0,17,26,HARLAN,"Some left through the ring we discovered. The ring, which you went through. They carried along small, more portable sources with them. I expected them to come home, I waited. This is home, after all. But they...didn't. And the rest did not except the gift, they ended there existence."
0,17,26,DANIEL,How?
0,17,26,HARLAN,"They walked above the surface, far from here, Outside of the range of the power source. Wallas, he was the last one, he gave his life for the station. An accident. And I have been alone since Wallace. But you are here now, and everything is better now. Will you hold this for me?"
0,17,26,HARLAN,"Com-traya! Very helpful! We work together well. There see? We accomplish things.So we must remain near the power source incase it breaks down again. Without the continuous stream from the emitter, these bodies could not function for more then a few hours. And that is why I new you would come back."
0,17,26,JACK,"Harlan, we want to go home."
0,17,26,HARLAN,"No, no, you must stay, you are friends. New friends."
0,17,26,JACK,Friends? I don't even like you. Chances are I will never like you.
0,17,26,SAM,"Colonel. If we are ever going to get home, we need him."
0,17,26,HARLAN,"You still do not appreciate the gift? Immortality, 11000 going on infinity. I always say. Oh no!Very bad, very bad."
0,17,26,SAM,What is it?
0,17,26,HARLAN,"The power source, for us! I spent too much time away from the station to create you. Hurry, there's not much time, we must repair it or else we will all die."
0,17,27,HARLAN,"I think the thermo compensator has malfunctioned again. Ah-ha, tube 18 is lost. It draws heat in from the planetary core, must be vented. The surface wind drives irradiated acid rain into the ventilation system. It rust the valves closed."
0,17,27,SAM,So what's keeping us going?
0,17,27,HARLAN,"Reserve power, like when you went back to your world.Not much time!"
0,17,27,DANIEL,Has this ever happened before?
0,17,27,HARLAN,Not since Wallis was still alive. That is the reason I created you. We must work together. Please help!
0,17,27,JACK,"Alright, I'll help. Where's Daniel:, we could use him."
0,17,27,HARLAN,"It does not matter, he is different."
0,17,27,SAM,"Okay, so what do we do?"
0,17,27,HARLAN,"I had to shut down most of the vents. We have to open more and reroute the ventilation.There and there, I will stay here to operate the computer."
0,17,27,SAM,"How do we find these vents, how do we open them?"
0,17,27,HARLAN,"The automatic controls no longer work and the vent are rusted close. You will have to open up the vent shafts, and so it manually. Search your minds it is all there. I made sure of it. You have all the answers you need, now go! Go! Go! Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear."
0,17,28,DANIEL,This way.
0,17,31,DANIEL,There it is.
0,17,32,DANIEL,Did you see that?
0,17,32,SAM,Daniel.
0,17,32,DANIEL,"Oh. Harlan is right, it's rusted shut, I can feel it.There, I've got it."
0,17,33,JACK,"Not yet, Harlan. Not yet!"
0,17,34,JACK,Teal'c Thank God! Where have you been?
0,17,35,JACK,Teal'c
0,17,36,JACK,Teal'c what are you doing?
0,17,37,JACK,Come on. Teal'c come on! Teal'c
0,17,38,JACK,Teal'c
0,17,40,DANIEL,We did it.
0,17,41,SAM,Teal'c don't!
0,17,42,SAM,Colonel.
0,17,42,JACK,I'm alright.
0,17,43,SAM,I'm sorry but your not.
0,17,43,HARLAN,"It is only damage, I can repair it. All will be well, you will see. And your friend too."
0,17,43,JACK,What Teal'c?
0,17,43,DANIEL,You killed him!
0,17,43,HARLAN,He was malfunctioning.
0,17,43,DANIEL,How will all be well with him if he is dead?
0,17,43,HARLAN,"You will see. Now the station is repaired, go back to your quarters and wait. You will see."
0,17,44,JACK,Keep an eye on him!
0,17,45,DANIEL,"Harlan, open up!"
0,17,45,SAM,Harlan!
0,17,45,HARLAN,"No, no, no! Go away!"
0,17,45,DANIEL,"Harlan, What the hell are you doing?"
0,17,46,HARLAN,"All will be well, please I..."
0,17,46,SAM,He's making a new synthetic Teal'c.
0,17,46,HARLAN,"Please go back you your quarters, and I will bring him to you when..."
0,17,46,SAM,How is this possible?
0,17,46,HARLAN,"yes, um, there were two minds before, the creature he carried within. Two beings. The two minds could not co-exist, and your friend malfunctioned. I did not know he was different. I will not make that mistake this time."
0,17,46,SAM,"Answer my question this time. How can you make a new synthetic Teal'c, without the original?"
0,17,47,JACK,"Captain Carter. Stand aside. Harlan, turn off that machine."
0,17,47,HARLAN,"The process is incomplete, I can..."
0,17,47,JACK,Turn it off! Now answer the Captains question.
0,17,47,HARLAN,"Please if you destroy me, you will destroy the last survivor of an entire people, and yourselves too."
0,17,47,JACK,"I'm going to ask this question once. Do our bodies, our real bodies exist somewhere?"
0,17,47,HARLAN,Yes.
0,17,47,JACK,"Then I want you to put us back,now."
0,17,47,HARLAN,"I could not do that, even if I wanted to."
0,17,47,SAM,"Why? If you can transfer our consciousness into these bodies, surely you can reverse the process."
0,17,47,HARLAN,No it is impossible.
0,17,47,JACK,Why?
0,17,47,HARLAN,I will show you.
0,17,48,JACK,My God.
0,17,48,HARLAN,I meant no harm. I will return them through the ring as soon as I am certain you had accepted your transference.
0,17,48,CLONE SAM,"Except it's not really a transference, is it? From one to the other, we're copies."
0,17,48,HARLAN,"Yes, as good as the original. Better even. If you had not been so insistent you would have never seen each other. Once I new the transference was successful. I had intended to send your organic selves, back to your world, uh, their world. They would never have known of your existence. And in time would hope that you would have excepted yours."
0,17,48,CLONE JACK,We can never go back.
0,17,48,HARLAN,"No, you belong here. You are welcome here."
0,17,49,CLONE SAM,Teal'c
0,17,49,DANIEL,: Captain Carter.
0,17,49,CLONE SAM,"Colonel, he's alright."
0,17,49,CLONE JACK,"That's great, Captain."
0,17,50,JACK,Daniel?
0,17,50,CLONE DANIEL,"Ah, sort of. Here let me get that."
0,17,50,JACK,"Harlan, where have you been?"
0,17,50,HARLAN,Extremely busy.
0,17,50,JACK,"I can see that, doing what?"
0,17,50,HARLAN,"Oh, creating your synthetic others. Saving the planet. Busy, busy."
0,17,50,JACK,Synthetic?
0,17,50,HARLAN,"Yes. I am sorry for restraining you for so long, I am afraid my plan has failed rather miserably. But as I promised, you are free to go."
0,17,50,SAM,This is impossible.
0,17,50,CLONE SAM,It's true. At first we did not even know we had been changed.
0,17,50,SAM,Recreating the neurostructer on...
0,17,50,CLONE SAM,"I know! Defies the uncertainty principle. We are identical, right down to the mole on our..."
0,17,50,SAM,Shut up.
0,17,50,DANIEL,: Was not a copy made of me?
0,17,50,HARLAN,"Oh yes. But um, I had to disintegrate you."
0,17,50,DANIEL,: I see.
0,17,50,SAM,"You get it, you just don't like it."
0,17,50,DANIEL,"Ah, well..."
0,17,50,JACK,"Listen, I'm not to happy about this either you know."
0,17,50,CLONE JACK,You think you know how I feel?
0,17,50,JACK,"Well, yeah. Were basically the same guy aren't we?"
0,17,50,CLONE JACK,"Ah, have a look."
0,17,51,JACK,Ow. Sorry.
0,17,51,CLONE JACK,Yeah.
0,17,51,JACK,"So, um, what the hell happened here?"
0,17,51,CLONE JACK,Somebody stole my life. That's what happened.
0,17,51,JACK,You talking about my life?
0,17,51,CLONE JACK,"Hey, I've got every right to it that you do. I was kind of hoping I could figure out away to undo all this, get myself back into my body, where I belong."
0,17,51,JACK,"Well it's occupied, thank you."
0,17,51,CLONE JACK,I noticed that. What does that make me? What do you want?
0,17,51,JACK,Well there all debating the meaning of life out there; both Daniels think this is all fascinating. The Carters are arguing already. Teal'c feels left out. You and I have got a few things to talk about.
0,17,51,CLONE JACK,"I'm not going to give you a hard time about who gets to go back, if that's what you mean."
0,17,51,JACK,Thank you.
0,17,51,CLONE JACK,"It has nothing to do with generosity, believe me. I can't go back. If I could it might be a different story."
0,17,51,JACK,"Yeah well, there is a little issue of security. You know everything I know about Earth. Codes, defenses."
0,17,51,CLONE JACK,"Well bury the gate, don't worry. And don't even think about sending a bomb to make sure."
0,17,51,JACK,I wasn't.
0,17,51,CLONE JACK,Yes you were. I know you.
0,17,51,JACK,"Alright, alright, you have my word, Colonel."
0,17,51,CLONE JACK,Call me Jack.
0,17,51,HARLAN,Colonel O'Neill?
0,17,51,BOTH JACK'S,"Oh, for crying out loud."
0,17,51,CLONE JACK,I'll handle this.
0,17,52,HARLAN,"Aw, there you are, I was worried about you. Where is the other one?"
0,17,52,CLONE JACK,He's getting ready to go home.
0,17,52,HARLAN,"Yes, all for the best. I hope in time you will forgive me."
0,17,52,CLONE JACK,You were just trying to survive.
0,17,52,HARLAN,"Yes, and we will! All will be well, you will see!"
0,17,52,CLONE JACK,"Harlan, people are not supposed to live forever."
0,17,52,HARLAN,"Maybe not, but if you try just a few hundred years, perhaps you might change your mind. Yes?"
0,17,52,JACK,So don't forget to bury the gate when we're gone.
0,17,52,CLONE JACK,Like that's something I would forget.
0,17,52,JACK,"Well. See ya. And uh, you should have that looked at, it's..."
0,17,52,CLONE JACK,Have a good life.
0,17,52,JACK,See ya.
