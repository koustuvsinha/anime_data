0,170,1,ANUBIS,You have failed me.
0,170,1,BAAL,Weve known for some time that the Jaffa cannot be trusted any more. The remaining army of Kull warriors stand an excellent chance of retaking Dakara but ...
0,170,2,ANUBIS,"Worse than failure, worse than cowardice, you have betrayed me. Did you not think I wouldnt know what you had done? How can you still underestimate my powers?"
0,170,2,BAAL,Your methods were ultimately unnecessary - not when there was another way of defeating the Replicators.
0,170,2,ANUBIS,"I will spare your life for the moment, only so that you may witness the fruits of your labours. First, I will retake Dakara; then, thanks to the modifications you have made to the Stargate, I will destroy every living thing in this galaxy - including you - all at once."
0,170,2,BAAL,I do not understand. You could have modified the Stargate yourself.
0,170,2,ANUBIS,You have no way of knowing what is necessary and what is not in the grand design.
0,170,2,BAAL,Whose grand design?
0,170,2,ANUBIS,Mine.
0,170,3,CARTER,"Sorry, sir. I saw you were with someone - I didnt want to interrupt."
0,170,3,ONEILL,Whats up?
0,170,3,CARTER,Who was that?
0,170,3,ONEILL,"Um, Kerry Johnson, CIA."
0,170,3,CARTER,"Ive heard the name. Oh, yeah, she was heading up the investigation into, uh, Goauld still at large after the incident with The Trust."
0,170,3,ONEILL,Yeah.
0,170,3,CARTER,"Sir, I wanted to talk to you about ..."
0,170,3,ONEILL,Carter.
0,170,3,CARTER,We havent heard from him in a week.
0,170,3,ONEILL,Doesnt mean anything.
0,170,3,CARTER,"Sir, we know he was captured by Replicators. Chances are he was on board a Replicator ship when it disintegrated."
0,170,3,ONEILL,All we know for sure is that hes missing.
0,170,3,CARTER,Sooner or later ...
0,170,3,ONEILL,Forget it! Im not fallin for it this time.
0,170,3,CARTER,Falling for it?
0,170,3,ONEILL,"Yeah! How many times have you thought he was gone, and then he shows up - in one form or another. Im sorry, but were not having a memorial service for someone who is not dead. You hear that?! Im not buyin it! What? Hes just waitin for us to say a bunch of nice things about him. Next thing you know, hell come waltzin through that door, like, right now. Waltzing ... now."
0,170,4,WAITRESS,So - what can I get for you?
0,170,5,TOLOK,"Brothers Bratac of Chulak, and Tealc of the Tauri. For your enduring courage and vision, for the strength of will that has brought us to freedom from the Goauld, a future we have yet to even comprehend, but one that will be determined by our own unfettered will, I hereby bestow upon you the highest honour any Jaffa can know. From this day forward, you shall both be known as blood kin to all Jaffa!"
0,170,6,BRATAC,"Brothers! From this day forward, no Jaffa shall bow before anyone - and never again before a false god."
0,170,7,TOLOK,"Hail, brother Bratac! Hail, brother Tealc! . A Jaffa sounds a large, ornate horn. The Jaffa continue to cheer. Tealc and Bratac, their fists still on their hearts, turn and begin to walk out of the temple.)"
0,170,7,BRATAC,"Be proud, Tealc. Today we are free."
0,170,7,TEALC,"This day is not yet over, brother."
0,170,8,BRATAC,Then I shall be proud for you - and of you.
0,170,10,PETE,Hey!
0,170,10,CARTER,"Hi! Thank you, Airman."
0,170,10,PETE,"So, this is exciting! Whats the surprise?"
0,170,10,CARTER,Youll see.
0,170,10,PETE,"Do I get to go through the Stargate? I mean, what planet are we going to?!"
0,170,10,CARTER,You dont get to go through the Stargate!
0,170,10,PETE,
0,170,10,CARTER,"Oh, its big!"
0,170,10,CARTER,"Pete Shanahan - Jacob Carter. Dad, this is Pete."
0,170,11,PETE,Dad!
0,170,11,JACOB,Not quite yet. You have to actually marry my daughter before you can call me that.
0,170,11,PETE,"I was just ... I meant, duh, stammer, stammer! Its an honour to meet you, sir, really. Why didnt you tell me?"
0,170,11,CARTER,I didnt want you to be nervous.
0,170,11,PETE,
0,170,11,JACOB,I think it was Sam that was nervous.
0,170,11,PETE,How did not telling me help?
0,170,11,CARTER,It didnt.
0,170,11,PETE,This is great! Youve really got one of those things in your head?
0,170,12,JACOB,"If, by one of those things, you mean a two thousand year old TokRa symbiont, yes."
0,170,12,PETE,Seriously?! Go on! That has gotta freak you right out sometimes! Its weird!
0,170,14,JIM,Hey! What do I have to do to get some more coffee around here?
0,170,14,OMA,Find your enlightenment.
0,170,14,DANIEL,Menus?
0,170,14,OMA,We dont need them here - just order what youd like.
0,170,14,DANIEL,
0,170,14,OMA,"The Replicator version of Sam was in your head trying to access the knowledge buried in your subconscious, but you gained control of her instead. She killed you to stop you. Thats where I stepped in. Hows that?"
0,170,14,DANIEL,Pretty clear.
0,170,14,OMA,"Well, we aim to please. The customer comes first, you know!"
0,170,14,DANIEL,So Im ascended again.
0,170,14,OMA,Not exactly. Sort of a ... stop along the way. You have to make that choice for yourself.
0,170,14,DANIEL,Waffles.
0,170,14,OMA,Bacon on the side?
0,170,14,DANIEL,No - I remember this place.
0,170,14,OMA,You should - it came from your mind.
0,170,14,DANIEL,My grandfather brought me here after my parents funeral. I had waffles.
0,170,14,OMA,Waffles it is.
0,170,14,DANIEL,Wait. How do I know its really you this time? How do I know this isnt some trick Replicator Sams playing to stop me from controlling her?
0,170,14,OMA,How deep is the river if you cannot see the bottom?
0,170,14,JIM,"Deeper than the coffee in my cup, Ill tell you that!"
0,170,14,OMA,"Excuse me. Frank, I need a nose boy in a blanket, two hen fruit wrecked on a shingle with a mystery in the alley, a warm mead with a mouldy lid, and two checkerboards, alright? Oh yeah, hold the pig."
0,170,15,BRATAC,"We have dreamed of this day for so long, fought so hard for it, and sacrificed so much. Now that it is here ..."
0,170,15,TEALC,"It is not here, brother."
0,170,15,BRATAC,"The balance of power has shifted, Tealc. Our victory here at Dakara has turned the tide. Jaffa everywhere are abandoning the old ways, coming to see the Goauld for the false gods they are."
0,170,15,TEALC,"We are foolish to rejoice in conquest over the Goauld when they are not all dead. Anubis claim to be a god is false, but his powers most certainly are not."
0,170,15,BRATAC,"It is agreed. He must be dealt with. But for once, there may be greater concerns than the eradication of all the Goauld. So consumed were we in attaining freedom that we did not plan nearly enough for its aftermath. The Jaffa have fought with each other for so long that uniting them as one may prove as difficult a task as convincing them to free themselves from the Goauld. Generations of war and mistrust will not be healed overnight."
0,170,15,TEALC,"Indeed. If we do not organise quickly, freedom will become anarchy."
0,170,15,BRATAC,The high priests are proposing a leadership be assembled.
0,170,15,TEALC,That is wise.
0,170,15,BRATAC,They wish both of us to sit on the Council. You know that will take you from the Tauri. Your purpose in joining them was to one day free the Jaffa. Now that day is upon us. You must not abandon your people when we need you most.
0,170,15,TEALC,Of that I am aware.
0,170,15,BRATAC,"The Council will preside from the new Jaffa homeworld where a great city is to be erected - a haven for all those who have chosen freedom ... here, on the holy ground of Dakara."
0,170,16,JIM,Hey - I know you!
0,170,16,DANIEL,Really?
0,170,16,JIM,Yeah! The guy from the paper! Doctor Daniel Jackson.
0,170,16,JIM,"Its OK, keep it - Im done."
0,170,16,DANIEL,Thanks!
0,170,16,JIM,No problem!
0,170,18,CARTER,"So, you gonna visit Mark and the kids this trip?"
0,170,18,JACOB,Tomorrow.
0,170,18,CARTER,Is everything OK?
0,170,18,JACOB,Im just not very hungry.
0,170,18,CARTER,Youve been pretty quiet.
0,170,18,JACOB,Im fine.
0,170,18,CARTER,Dad?
0,170,18,JACOB,What?
0,170,18,CARTER,Its been two hours since Pete left. You havent said a word.
0,170,18,JACOB,I did so.
0,170,18,CARTER,He seems nice?!
0,170,18,JACOB,I believe thats three words.
0,170,18,CARTER,Im gonna marry him.
0,170,18,JACOB,I know. I just met him - what do you want me to say? I know how happy he makes you - thats all that matters to me.
0,170,18,OK.,
0,170,18,JACOB,Selmak really liked him.
0,170,18,CARTER,Selmak?!
0,170,18,JACOB,Yeah - and hes a great judge of character.
0,170,18,CARTER,"Well, OK!"
0,170,18,JACOB,"Look, Sam, Im tired. Its been a long day. I think Im gonna turn in early."
0,170,18,CARTER,Are you sure nothing else is wrong?
0,170,18,JACOB,Yeah. Ill see you in the morning.
0,170,18,CARTER,Goodnight.
0,170,19,ONEILL,What?
0,170,19,CARTER,"Sorry to wake you, sir. Tealcs back, and it sounds like we have a problem."
0,170,19,ONEILL,I knew it. Alright - Ill be there as soon as I can. Crap!
0,170,19,KERRY,What was that?
0,170,19,ONEILL,Trouble in Jaffaland. Gotta go. Im sorry.
0,170,20,DANIEL,You know about this?
0,170,20,OMA,Yes.
0,170,20,DANIEL,Youre not gonna do anything about it?
0,170,20,OMA,You know I cant.
0,170,20,DANIEL,Well Im certainly not just gonna sit here and let this happen.
0,170,20,OMA,"You cant leave - youre not ascended yet. You walk through that door, youre choosing the alternative."
0,170,20,DANIEL,Youre saying Ill be dead.
0,170,20,OMA,Pretty much.
0,170,20,DANIEL,
0,170,20,OMA,It doesnt mean youll be able to help your friends. You know the rules.
0,170,20,DANIEL,"Yes, but once Im ascended I can choose to take human form again, just like last time."
0,170,20,OMA,"Technically, yes, but you cant take that paper with you. You wont have any of the knowledge that youve gained here - and good luck ever ascending again. Im certainly not going to help you a third time."
0,170,20,DANIEL,So youre saying I can know Anubis is plotting to destroy all life in the galaxy and all I can do about it is stay here and contemplate my own enlightenment?
0,170,20,OMA,You can eat your waffles.
0,170,20,DANIEL,"No syrup?! Hi, hows it going? Im, uh, Daniel Jackson. Sorry to bother you - I just wanted to know if I could borrow your syrup. Although technically I know its not gonna be borrowing, because Im not actually gonna be giving back what I use. Enjoy your meal. Hey, guys! Hows it going?"
0,170,20,OMA,Theyre not going to talk to you.
0,170,20,DANIEL,Why not? Who are they?
0,170,20,OMA,Others. Youre not one of them yet.
0,170,20,DANIEL,You mean Ancients.
0,170,20,OMA,A couple of them.
0,170,20,DANIEL,What are they doing here?
0,170,20,OMA,Watching.
0,170,20,DANIEL,Me.
0,170,20,OMA,Me too. I told you before - theyre always watching. You wanted some motor oil?
0,170,22,ONEILL,I still wish you guys had blown that thing up when you had the chance.
0,170,22,CARTER,We had to at least be sure that all the Replicators really were eliminated.
0,170,22,JACOB,"And even though we apparently did get rid of them all in this galaxy, there may still be more elsewhere that could be a threat again."
0,170,22,CARTER,"So, we wanted to try to figure out how the device worked in case we ever needed something like it again."
0,170,22,ONEILL,"Great Well, now the Jaffa have something that can blow up the entire universe with the push of a button."
0,170,22,BRATAC,The Jaffa will defend Dakara with their lives.
0,170,22,ONEILL,You wanna explain to me why they dont wanna wreck it?
0,170,22,BRATAC,The ruins at Dakara have become a symbol of freedom.
0,170,22,TEALC,"Much more, the Jaffa believe that the devices power helped free them by destroying the Replicators. They also believe that controlling this power will help ensure their freedom in the future."
0,170,22,ONEILL,And get them virtually anything they want.
0,170,22,BRATAC,The Jaffa would never use it to that end.
0,170,22,JACOB,Jack is right. No-one should have that kind of power at their disposal.
0,170,23,CARTER,Sorry - thought Id turned it off.
0,170,23,ONEILL,"So - were all in agreement? One way or another, its gotta go, correct?"
0,170,23,TEALC,Indeed.
0,170,23,ONEILL,Thank you.
0,170,23,BRATAC,"If you are suggesting we destroy this device against the wishes of the High Council, I must point out that would not be a good first step in relations between the Tauri and the newly formed free Jaffa nation."
0,170,24,ONEILL,Why dont you do it? They already hate the TokRa.
0,170,24,JACOB,"To be honest, a plan may already be in the works, but as you know, Selmak and I arent fully in the loop any longer."
0,170,25,ONEILL,Mmm. Yes?
0,170,25,HARRIMAN,"Sorry to interrupt, sir. Colonel, theres a call for you. Apparently its urgent."
0,170,26,CARTER,Carter.
0,170,26,BRATAC,Tealc and I have arranged another meeting of the Jaffa Council.
0,170,26,TEALC,Our hope is to continue strengthening the bond between previously warring Jaffa by focusing on our common enemy.
0,170,27,CARTER,"Yeah, I know - its just that its not a good time right now."
0,170,27,TEALC,There are still many Goauld who remain a threat.
0,170,27,CARTER,"I know, Im sorry. ... I dont know - it could be an hour, it could be all day. ... Yeah. ... OK. ... Yeah, me too. Bye. Sorry about that, sir."
0,170,27,ONEILL,Emergency?
0,170,27,CARTER,"No, no. Just a, um, misunderstanding."
0,170,28,JACOB,"Hey, werent you supposed to meet Pete at the florists this morning?"
0,170,29,CARTER,"No, Dad."
0,170,29,JACOB,"No, Im sure thats what you said - for the wedding."
0,170,29,CARTER,I know.
0,170,29,ONEILL,"Go ahead, Carter. Its supposed to be your day off anyway."
0,170,29,CARTER,"Its OK, sir."
0,170,29,ONEILL,"Well, Tealc and Bratac are meeting with the Jaffa - theres nothin to do around here. Go pick flowers."
0,170,30,JACOB,What?
0,170,31,OMA,More coffee?
0,170,31,DANIEL,Sure. Can you sit a minute?
0,170,31,OMA,
0,170,31,DANIEL,Thats good!
0,170,31,OMA,How are your waffles?
0,170,31,DANIEL,Best I ever had. Can you tell me why you stopped me from killing Anubis the last time I was ascended?
0,170,31,OMA,"Because if I didnt stop you, the Others would have, and they wouldnt have been as nice about it."
0,170,31,DANIEL,You mean they wouldnt have erased my memory and left me naked on a planet?
0,170,31,OMA,"That was your choice. OK, maybe not the naked part. But I didnt totally erase your memory, even though I was supposed to."
0,170,31,DANIEL,"There - OK, why is it OK to break some rules and not others?"
0,170,32,DANIEL,"Look, if you knew I had a problem following the rules the last time, why offer me ascension again?"
0,170,33,OMA,"Because I didnt wanna see you die without at least giving you a second chance. Look, I have trouble following the rules. Im not really supposed to help people ascend. Youre supposed to do it on your own."
0,170,33,DANIEL,But you do it.
0,170,33,OMA,"I walk the line. Believe me - I crossed it a few times and paid for it dearly. My point is, you just need to be willing to put your prior human existence into the proper context. Sorry - I gotta get back to work."
0,170,33,JIM,"Coffee, please."
0,170,34,PETE,Chocolate or vanilla?
0,170,34,CARTER,Im sorry - what?
0,170,34,PETE,"Chocolate or vanilla - the cake, just in case you cant make the meeting with the caterer."
0,170,34,CARTER,Oh! Im sorry. I really do wanna be a part of this.
0,170,34,PETE,I hope so! Its your wedding too.
0,170,34,CARTER,I know!
0,170,34,PETE,"I realise this must be weird for you, worrying about place settings when we could be destroyed by aliens at any minute."
0,170,34,CARTER,A little.
0,170,34,PETE,"Were not about to be destroyed by aliens, are we?! Cos you seem a bit distracted."
0,170,34,CARTER,Im sorry.
0,170,34,PETE,So - did your dad like me?
0,170,34,CARTER,Of course! Why wouldnt he?
0,170,34,PETE,Tough guy to read.
0,170,34,CARTER,You just have to get to know him.
0,170,34,PETE,How bout ... Selmak?
0,170,34,CARTER,Ah! He thought you were very charming.
0,170,34,PETE,For a human.
0,170,34,CARTER,"Well, generally speaking, thats my type!"
0,170,35,PETE,Good! Did I tell you I also have a surprise for you?
0,170,35,CARTER,No! What is it?
0,170,35,PETE,Tricky! Youll see.
0,170,36,BRATAC,The Council remains unwilling to destroy the weapon for fear it will weaken the resolve of the Jaffa to stand united against the remaining Goauld.
0,170,36,ONEILL,You realise we have to consider that thing a threat to our security?
0,170,36,TEALC,Indeed.
0,170,36,BRATAC,"The Council recognises the danger and has decided to take action by aggressively seeking out and killing Anubis. Once that threat has been eliminated, they will reassess the decision to destroy the device."
0,170,36,ONEILL,"Well, we dont even know if Anubis can be killed yet, do we?"
0,170,36,TEALC,"We must not suggest to the Jaffa that he cannot be. At the very least, we can eliminate the remainder of the forces of Anubis."
0,170,36,BRATAC,I believe this quest will unite the remainder of the still-fractured armies by giving them focus on a common goal.
0,170,36,ONEILL,Got anything to go on?
0,170,36,TEALC,"Many of the Kull warriors were killed in battle with the Replicators, but intelligence gathered indicates that Anubis may be marshalling the remaining Kull warriors on Tartarus."
0,170,36,BRATAC,A pre-emptive strike is being prepared.
0,170,37,DANIEL,Hey.
0,170,37,JIM,Hey! Daniel! Hows it going?
0,170,37,DANIEL,Do we know each other? I feel like I know you.
0,170,37,JIM,Call me Jim. We ran into each other last time you were ascended.
0,170,37,DANIEL,Ah. Nice to meet you ... again!
0,170,37,JIM,"Still havent made up your mind, huh? Death - or everlasting enlightenment. I dont really see the choice, myself."
0,170,37,DANIEL,"Of course I dont wanna be dead - its just that, uh ... Listen, the reason I came over here was to ask you - why are you talkin to me?"
0,170,38,JIM,"Oh, you mean because these other snobs wont even look at you? Well, Im different, like Oma."
0,170,38,DANIEL,Really? Cos I kinda had the impression that you two dont quite see eye to eye.
0,170,38,JIM,"What, that little ...? Oh, that was nothing. We both operate somewhat outside the normal rules and regulations. Sometimes we disagree on how far outside we should go, thats all."
0,170,38,DANIEL,Really?
0,170,38,JIM,"Yeah. As long as these other guys dont strike me down, I figure Im OK."
0,170,38,DANIEL,"See, I guess thats what Im tryin to figure out. I mean, I feel like if I agree to ascend, Im signing a contract that I dont even know what it says. Now, obviously I had a little trouble with the fine print the last time."
0,170,38,JIM,You sure did!
0,170,38,DANIEL,You know about that?
0,170,38,JIM,"Well, its all out there."
0,170,38,DANIEL,I just dont see how I can agree to stand by and let Anubis destroy every living thing in the entire galaxy.
0,170,38,JIM,"I know. Thats a tough one. Speaking of which, have you seen the latest? Hes a crafty one. Really knows the ins and outs of the rules. I give him three to one odds to succeed. Wanna know the irony of it all? That device was originally used by the Ancients to create life in the Milky Way ... well, recreate it after the whole plague thing. No kidding. Now it all gets undone with the push of one button, leaving Anubis to recreate things all over to his own liking. Theres a waste of a million-odd years of evolution, huh? I say someone should really do something to stop him! But no-one will. Can I get a coffee?"
0,170,39,CARTER,Can I open them now?
0,170,39,PETE,Almost. OK. Now. What do you think?
0,170,39,CARTER,Uh ... well ... uh ...
0,170,39,PETE,"Speechless, huh?!"
0,170,39,CARTER,Yeah!
0,170,39,PETE,Yeah! Isnt it great?! Remember our first night together? You described the house you always wanted?
0,170,39,CARTER,I cant believe this.
0,170,39,PETE,"The kitchen isnt yellow, but we can paint. Cmon - Ill show you. And youre not gonna believe the back yard! The dogs gonna love it!"
0,170,39,CARTER,Dog?
0,170,40,DANIEL,This is bad.
0,170,40,JIM,"Yeah. And this pie is great, but theres nothing to wash it down with."
0,170,40,DANIEL,"Is there anything you can do to stop Anubis? I mean, you did say someone should do something."
0,170,40,JIM,"I did, didnt I? Well, as far as what can be done, its kinda complicated."
0,170,40,DANIEL,"Yeah, so Oma tells me."
0,170,40,JIM,"Yeah, well I dont think shes told you everything."
0,170,40,DANIEL,What does that mean?
0,170,40,JIM,Im sayin ... Ive already said too much.
0,170,40,DANIEL,"No, you havent - in fact, youve hardly said anything at all."
0,170,41,JIM,You gave up eternal enlightenment - all the knowledge and power of the universe. Why do you think you did that?
0,170,41,DANIEL,To fight for humanity any way I could.
0,170,41,JIM,"Yes, very big of you. You rejected everything Oma offered you, and now she just gives you another chance, based on the goodness of her heart?"
0,170,41,DANIEL,"Well, that is the point, isnt it? I mean, she is ascended - she is good."
0,170,41,JIM,"Sure, best intentions."
0,170,41,DANIEL,Do you know what happened between me and Oma? Why did I choose to take human form again?
0,170,41,JIM,You should ask Oma.
0,170,43,CARTER,"Hi, sir."
0,170,43,ONEILL,Carter!
0,170,43,CARTER,"Look, I-Im sorry to bother you at home like this, but, uh ..."
0,170,43,ONEILL,Howd you know I was here?
0,170,43,CARTER,I saw the smoke.
0,170,43,ONEILL,"Oh, yeah."
0,170,43,CARTER,"Look, is this, is this OK? I mean, I could have called first, but ..."
0,170,43,ONEILL,"No ... yeah ... I mean, its fine. So, um, what brings you to this neck of the woods on such a fine day in my back yard?"
0,170,43,CARTER,"Well, actually, Ive, um, Ive been sitting in your driveway for the last ten minutes trying to work up the nerve to come and talk to you. The truth is, Ive been trying to work up the nerve for a lot longer than that."
0,170,43,ONEILL,Oh?
0,170,43,CARTER,Pete put a down payment on a house.
0,170,43,ONEILL,"Well, thats great!"
0,170,43,CARTER,Its a beautiful house.
0,170,43,ONEILL,But?
0,170,43,CARTER,"The-the truth is, Im having second thoughts about the wedding."
0,170,43,ONEILL,Why?
0,170,43,CARTER,"See, the ... the thing is, the closer it gets, the more I get the feeling that ... Im making a big, huge, mistake."
0,170,44,ONEILL,"Look, Carter, the ... I dont know what"
0,170,44,CARTER,"Look, Im sorry to bother you with this, but, uh ... see, theres actually a very good reason that Im bothering you with this, and if I dont tell you now, I might never ..."
0,170,45,KERRY,"Jack, I looked everywhere - I could not find ... Colonel Carter."
0,170,46,ONEILL,Ms Johnson.
0,170,46,CARTER,"Yeah, I didnt - I didnt ..."
0,170,46,ONEILL,We were just ... meeting here in my back yard on this fine day to discuss the state of affairs.
0,170,47,KERRY,"Well, this is awkward!"
0,170,47,CARTER,Ya think?!
0,170,47,KERRY,Jack didnt want anyone at the SGC to know about us.
0,170,48,CARTER,"No, look, I, uh, uh, Im sorry, this is my fault, I really, I shouldnt have come by unannounced like this."
0,170,48,KERRY,"Well, yknow, now that the cats out of the bag, youre here, why dont you just stay? Im sure theres enough charred meat on the grill for all three of us."
0,170,49,CARTER,"No - thank you - I, um ... Its the SGC. Colonel Carter. What? When? ... OK, Im on my way. I-I gotta go. Uh, its my dad."
0,170,50,OMA,"Well, you cant stay here forever, you know. Actually, I suppose you could, I just dont know why youd really want to - except for the great service!"
0,170,50,DANIEL,"Look, obviously I dont wanna just die. I dont suppose theres any other options?"
0,170,50,OMA,I cant get into it. Whats stopping you from ascending?
0,170,50,DANIEL,I dont know.
0,170,50,OMA,Must be something holding you back - making you doubt yourself.
0,170,50,DANIEL,Maybe its not me Im doubting.
0,170,50,OMA,"Look, whether you choose to accept living on a higher plane of existence has nothing to do with me or anything that I can or cant tell you. Its all up to you."
0,170,50,DANIEL,But there is something youre not telling me.
0,170,50,OMA,Is that what Jim said? You shouldnt be listening to him.
0,170,50,DANIEL,Why not?
0,170,50,OMA,Because.
0,170,50,DANIEL,Good answer!
0,170,50,OMA,Yes.
0,170,51,CARTER,Dad?
0,170,51,JACOB,"Im sorry, kiddo. We both are."
0,170,51,CARTER,About what? Whats going on?
0,170,51,JACOB,I dont wanna ruin everything like this.
0,170,51,CARTER,Dad?
0,170,51,JACOB,Its Selmak - hes dying.
0,170,51,CARTER,Oh my God. Im sorry.
0,170,51,JACOB,Its OK. Hes OK. He led a pretty full life.
0,170,51,CARTER,"I didnt live with Jolinar that long, but I think I have some idea what its like."
0,170,51,JACOB,"Well, this is a little different, Sam. As you know, when a TokRa symbiont dies, they can prevent their host from dying as Jolinar did with you. The problem is, that last selfless act requires a certain amount of energy and a conscious effort."
0,170,51,CARTER,What are you saying?
0,170,51,JACOB,"By all rights, Selmak should have been dead weeks ago. I wouldnt let him go. I thought we needed him - that I needed him to help you stop the Replicators."
0,170,51,CARTER,Dad?
0,170,51,JACOB,"He hung on as long as he could, then he slipped into a coma just after we activated the weapon on Dakara."
0,170,51,CARTER,Youve known all this time since then?
0,170,51,JACOB,"I didnt wanna spoil your wedding. Now, I thought we could make it."
0,170,52,CARTER,We?
0,170,52,JACOB,"Hes barely alive. Im gonna die with him, Sam."
0,170,54,JIM,Where is she?
0,170,54,DANIEL,I dunno. Off doing whatever it is she does when shes not here.
0,170,54,JIM,You ask her?
0,170,54,DANIEL,Yep.
0,170,54,JIM,Wouldnt tell you?
0,170,54,DANIEL,Nope.
0,170,54,JIM,"Had to find out for yourself last time, too. Man, were you pissed!"
0,170,54,DANIEL,About what? Tell me.
0,170,54,JIM,What do you know about Anubis?
0,170,54,DANIEL,"I know hes half-ascended, whatever that means."
0,170,54,JIM,"There are many planes of existence between human existence and ascension. Basically, the Others use their collective powers to keep him from affecting anything on a grand, cosmic level."
0,170,54,DANIEL,But its OK for him to destroy an entire galaxy?
0,170,54,JIM,Its OK for him to do anything he could have done back when he was a regular old Goauld.
0,170,54,DANIEL,
0,170,54,JIM,Goaulds are bad. Anubis is as bad as they come.
0,170,54,DANIEL,And?
0,170,54,JIM,And?
0,170,54,DANIEL,"And ascension requires that somebody be pure of spirit. One must be good to the very core to achieve enlightenment, so how did someone like Anubis ascend?"
0,170,55,JIM,Now hes getting it!
0,170,55,DANIEL,"Oma helps people ascend, but shed never help somebody like Anubis!"
0,170,55,JIM,Maybe not on purpose.
0,170,55,DANIEL,"What, youre saying he tricked her somehow?"
0,170,55,JIM,"Rule Number One! No lone ascended being shall help a lower ascend. Lowers are what we call humans and such. If you deserve to be here, you should be able to get here on your own. If theres an exception - for whatever reason - a majority vote by the collective can get you in, but Oma thinks she knows better - and shes taken her licks for it. Now I admit, for the most part, shes brought good people on board but, as the old saying goes, nobodys perfect - not even us higher beings."
0,170,56,DANIEL,Oma helped Anubis ascend.
0,170,56,OMA,Get out. Get out now.
0,170,57,JIM,"Well, look at the time. Gotta go, kid - uh, business to attend to. It was nice talking to you, though."
0,170,58,CARTER,A number of the TokRa have responded. They wanna pay their respects.
0,170,58,JACOB,They can come.
0,170,58,CARTER,I cant believe theres nothing they can do. They can remove a Goauld. In the last few years youve almost perfected the process of saving a host.
0,170,58,JACOB,"That process instantly kills the symbiont before it releases toxins. Its too late for that, Sam. Im sorry. I hate to do this to you, but I should have been dead four years ago. Since then, Ive been all over the galaxy. Ive done things most men never dream of."
0,170,58,CARTER,Where have I heard that before?
0,170,58,JACOB,I just wanna know youre gonna be happy.
0,170,58,CARTER,I am.
0,170,58,JACOB,Dont let rules stand in your way.
0,170,59,CARTER,What are you talking about?
0,170,59,JACOB,You joined the Air Force because of me.
0,170,59,CARTER,I love my job.
0,170,59,JACOB,Mmm. You can still have everything you want.
0,170,59,CARTER,"I do, Dad. Really."
0,170,60,KERRY,Hows Colonel Carters father?
0,170,60,ONEILL,Doesnt look good.
0,170,60,KERRY,Sorry to hear that.
0,170,60,ONEILL,Closing the door.
0,170,60,KERRY,Yeah. Deeply symbolic.
0,170,60,ONEILL,Really?
0,170,60,KERRY,I really like you. Were good together.
0,170,61,ONEILL,Yes. We are. But?
0,170,61,KERRY,"You have issues. Its OK - we all do. Theres just one big one in particular that I dont think I can love with. Live with. I need to get out before I get more involved. We can still work together, cant we? Id hate to have to ask for reassignment. This is really important to me. We agreed this would never affect the job."
0,170,61,ONEILL,We did.
0,170,61,KERRY,"Good. You know, theres just one thing I dont understand."
0,170,61,ONEILL,Just one?
0,170,61,KERRY,"Is the Air Force the only thing keeping you two apart? Rules and regulations? Cos if it is, youre making a very big mistake."
0,170,61,ONEILL,And you know what I should do?
0,170,61,KERRY,Retire.
0,170,61,ONEILL,Again.
0,170,61,KERRY,"Dont get me wrong - you are considered invaluable to the programme by the Pentagon, but the President has appointed a civilian to run the SGC before. Just a thought."
0,170,62,BRATAC,The time has come for this ancient warrior to fight one final battle.
0,170,62,TEALC,"I think not, old man. This victory will present us with many new challenges that will require your wisdom and sound judgement."
0,170,62,BRATAC,"What our people will require is a youthful, vital, leadership, and that is something others are better suited to provide."
0,170,62,TEALC,You are only as old as you believe yourself to be.
0,170,62,BRATAC,Talk to me in fifty years!
0,170,62,TEALC,Indeed I will.
0,170,63,DANIEL,So its true.
0,170,63,OMA,He tricked me.
0,170,63,DANIEL,How? You couldnt tell?!
0,170,63,OMA,"No. He must have found some old Ancient research on ascension. When he came to Kheb, he knew what he was doing. When I realised the horrible mistake that I had made, I tried to undo it, but I couldnt. Thats when the Others stepped in."
0,170,63,DANIEL,I dont understand - they only sent him halfway back. Why not all the way?
0,170,63,OMA,Its complicated.
0,170,63,DANIEL,"Yeah, what isnt around here?"
0,170,63,OMA,They warned him - he wasnt allowed to use any knowledge or power unless he otherwise would have gained it as a Goauld.
0,170,63,DANIEL,I dont understand. They let him wreak havoc. They dont care if he destroys all life in the galaxy - life they themselves created?
0,170,63,OMA,They havent stopped me from continuing my work. Ive tried to make up for it - help when I can.
0,170,63,DANIEL,"Its your punishment. Youre forced to watch, powerless to interfere, and let Anubis do whatever he wants just to punish you?"
0,170,63,OMA,"I told you before - the galaxy youre from, the plane of existence, is so small and insignificant compared to the rest of the universe."
0,170,63,DANIEL,I dont care. Its wrong.
0,170,63,OMA,Thats what you said last time.
0,170,63,DANIEL,"Excuse me? Isnt it enough already? I mean, a whole galaxy of innocent people enslaved and tortured for generations, now on the verge of being destroyed for nothing? For what? For one mistake a good person made trying to do a good thing. Cmon, the least you could do is listen to me. That cant be against the grand high-falutin cosmic rules! Hey! Im talkin to you! OK. OK. Well, I know you can hear me. Hasnt she suffered enough already? And certainly enough other people have suffered to punish her. Dont you think youve made your point?"
0,170,63,OMA,"Thats the thing, Daniel. They dont. I keep breaking the same rule - helping people ascend. Thats why youre here."
0,170,63,DANIEL,What if you stopped?
0,170,63,OMA,"Wouldnt undo the problem. Thats why I keep doing what I do. Anubis cant be killed - not by you, not by me."
0,170,64,BRATAC,He is not here. No-one is here! The defences we fought through were automated.
0,170,64,TEALC,We have been deceived.
0,170,64,BRATAC,"Anubis fled us, to lure us here. Our forces defending Dakara are depleted."
0,170,64,TEALC,"We could not have known, brother."
0,170,64,BRATAC,"You were right, old friend. The device at Dakara should have been destroyed at all costs."
0,170,65,ONEILL,You OK?
0,170,65,CARTER,"Actually, Im fine. Good, even, strange as that sounds. I thought I lost him four years ago. Since then, weve been closer than we ever were in my whole life. In a way, Selmak gave me the father I never thought Id know."
0,170,66,ONEILL,Cme here.
0,170,66,CARTER,"Thank you, sir."
0,170,66,ONEILL,For what?
0,170,66,CARTER,For being here for me.
0,170,66,ONEILL,Always.
0,170,67,JACOB,Im ready.
0,170,67,JACOB,I love you.
0,170,68,JIM,Can I get a coffee?
0,170,68,OMA,Get it yourself.
0,170,68,JIM,"Dont mind if I do! Ooh! Hey, Danny boy, you see the paper?"
0,170,68,DANIEL,"No, whats it say?"
0,170,68,JIM,"The trick worked! Those stupid Jaffa took half their ships to hunt down Anubis. Meanwhile, his army was poised to attack Dakara. The remaining rebel Jaffa guarding Dakara are being slaughtered. Its only a matter of time before old Anubis gets his hands on the weapon."
0,170,68,DANIEL,Im sorry - you sound almost happy about that.
0,170,68,JIM,"Who, me?"
0,170,68,DANIEL,Yeah. What do you have against Oma?
0,170,68,OMA,Daniel.
0,170,68,DANIEL,"No - I wanna know. I mean, youre not just watching - youre coming in here to rub it in. Why are you taking such pleasure in her punishment?"
0,170,68,JIM,"Me? I dont have anything against Oma. I think shes great, dont I? Hell, shes the one that helped me ascend. You got it, huh?"
0,170,68,DANIEL,You are Anubis.
0,170,68,JIM/ANUBIS,Cheers.
0,170,69,PETE,I knew from the beginning. Guess I just thought when you said yes that ... You were worth the risk. Dont say I deserve better. Cant get much better than you.
0,170,69,CARTER,Thats not true.
0,170,69,PETE,I wish I could believe this had something to do with your father - you needed some time to just work things out. I guess all I can say is: I hope you get what you want.
0,170,69,CARTER,Thats it?
0,170,69,PETE,What do you want? You want me to get down on my knees and beg?
0,170,69,CARTER,"God, no! Of course not! I just ... I thought you would react differently."
0,170,70,PETE,"Goodbye, Sam."
0,170,70,CARTER,Pete ...
0,170,71,TEALC,The rebel fleet guarding Dakara has fallen to the forces of Anubis. Bratac and the remaining rebel ships will not arrive in time. Anubis now controls the weapon.
0,170,71,ONEILL,"Well then, we find the biggest damned nuke we can and we shove it right through the Gate now."
0,170,71,TEALC,Anubis will certainly have the Gate shielded. The nuke will not arrive in one piece.
0,170,72,CARTER,"If we can dial the Alpha site, we may be able to prevent the weapon from connecting the wormhole to either planet. It may only buy us the thirty-eight minutes that the Gate can ..."
0,170,72,ONEILL,"Go, go, just go."
0,170,73,CARTER,"Sergeant, dial the Alpha site now."
0,170,74,HARRIMAN,Wait a minute - thats not me.
0,170,74,CARTER,What?
0,170,74,HARRIMAN,I dont know. Incoming wormhole!
0,170,74,CARTER,Thats not gonna stop the energy from the weapon.
0,170,74,ONEILL,If it is the weapon.
0,170,74,HARRIMAN,No iris codes.
0,170,74,CARTER,Were too late.
0,170,74,ONEILL,Self destruct.
0,170,74,CARTER,"Thats not gonna destroy the Gate, and theoretically theres only a remote chance it would disengage an active incoming wormhole."
0,170,74,ONEILL,Carter! Carter.
0,170,75,ANUBIS,"Oh, you make a great cup of coffee. Well, gotta go."
0,170,76,ANUBIS,Theres nothing you can do. You dont have the power.
0,170,76,OMA,But I do.
0,170,76,ANUBIS,You cant kill me either.
0,170,76,OMA,I can fight you.
0,170,76,ANUBIS,"Well, you cant win."
0,170,76,OMA,It wont matter. You wont be able to do anything but fight me back.
0,170,76,ANUBIS,"Well, what are you gonna do?"
0,170,76,OMA,Something I should have done a long time ago.
0,170,76,ANUBIS,"Oh, no. No. No! No!"
0,170,76,HARRIMAN,Wormhole disengaged.
0,170,76,CARTER,Whats going on?
0,170,76,HARRIMAN,I dont know. Must be some kind of ... system malfunction.
0,170,76,CARTER,Thats impossible!
0,170,76,ONEILL,Shut it off.
0,170,76,CARTER,Aborting self destruct.
0,170,77,BRATAC,"The Kull warriors became ... disorganised, confused, as though they no longer knew what to do."
0,170,77,TEALC,They no longer had a master to serve.
0,170,77,BRATAC,"After that, they were easily defeated."
0,170,77,TEALC,"Many Jaffa lost their lives at Dakara. Those that survived are united as never before, and we are in agreement - the weapon must be destroyed."
0,170,77,ONEILL,"Well, thats good."
0,170,77,BRATAC,A new memorial will be erected in its place so that our triumph over the Goauld will never be forgotten.
0,170,77,CARTER,"I still dont quite understand what happened. One minute Anubis is about to push the button that ends all life in the galaxy, and the next minute hes just ... gone."
0,170,77,TEALC,Indeed. It is a great mystery.
0,170,77,BRATAC,"One can only assume he was vanquished by some beings. If not, why would he forfeit the weapon and his army?"
0,170,78,CARTER,You think?
0,170,78,ONEILL,I do.
0,170,78,CARTER,Its the only thing that would explain the self destruct not going off.
0,170,78,BRATAC,Of what do you speak?
0,170,78,TEALC,ONeill believes that Daniel Jackson was somehow responsible.
0,170,78,DANIEL,No! It wasnt me.
0,170,78,ONEILL,Anybody else hear that?
0,170,78,DANIEL,Im in here!
0,170,78,ONEILL,Thats Daniel!
0,170,78,DANIEL,No! Dont come in!
0,170,78,ONEILL,Ho! Hey there!
0,170,78,DANIEL,Can you get me ... something?
0,170,78,DANIEL,"Its, uh, a long story."
0,170,79,CARTER,This is great.
0,170,79,ONEILL,I told ya!
0,170,79,CARTER,I cant believe we didnt do this years ago.
0,170,79,ONEILL,"Yes, well, lets not dwell."
0,170,79,CARTER,"There are no fish in this pond, are there?"
0,170,79,ONEILL,No.
0,170,79,ONEILL,Nice!
