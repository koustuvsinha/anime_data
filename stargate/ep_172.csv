0,172,1,DANIEL,"Look, the only reason you have the Stargate is cos of us!"
0,172,1,HAMMOND,Im aware of that.
0,172,1,DANIEL,"Im a linguist! By all accounts, your team may need one."
0,172,1,CARTER,And what if something goes wrong with the Gate on the other end?
0,172,1,HAMMOND,Neither of you have had any military training whatsoever. Have either one of you ever even fired a weapon of any kind?
0,172,1,CARTER,Well ... unless you count launching a rocket.
0,172,1,HAMMOND,"Look, Im sorry. Your expertise may be needed some time in the future, but for now ..."
0,172,1,DANIEL,"Well, can I ask who is going?"
0,172,2,CARTER,I dont understand. What made you change your mind?
0,172,3,KAWALSKY,"Hi, Jack."
0,172,3,ONEILL,"Thats Colonel, Major."
0,172,3,KAWALSKY,Youre retired.
0,172,3,ONEILL,I was.
0,172,3,DANIEL,I take it you two know each other.
0,172,3,ONEILL,"Yeah, we served together a long time ago."
0,172,3,KAWALSKY,"Ah, it wasnt that long ago."
0,172,3,HAMMOND,Major Kawalsky has been assigned to assemble the team that will go through the Stargate.
0,172,3,ONEILL,And you knew I couldnt say no if he was involved.
0,172,3,KAWALSKY,"Oh, come on, Colonel. You dont owe me anything. Admit it - youve gotta be a little curious: travelling to a different planet - through a wormhole!"
0,172,3,CARTER,I know I am!
0,172,3,KAWALSKY,"Sir, with all due respect - what are they still doing here?"
0,172,3,HAMMOND,"Im not sure. Airmen, please escort ..."
0,172,3,DANIEL,Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. We were all on that tape.
0,172,3,KAWALSKY,That tape had nothing to do with it. Jack ONeills one of the best Ive ever served with.
0,172,3,CARTER,"You may not care that this timeline is a direct result of tampering with the past, but you have to acknowledge that the tape said the planet youre going to is enemy territory - an enemy that is way more advanced than us technologically."
0,172,3,ONEILL,Whats your point?
0,172,3,CARTER,Youre literally walking into a totally alien situation outmanned and outgunned.
0,172,3,ONEILL,Do we have a choice?
0,172,4,CARTER,"Weve only been able to activate the interior lights and the dialling computer, but according to the tape, you have the gene that can make this ship fly."
0,172,4,ONEILL,And travel through time.
0,172,4,DANIEL,"Well, presumably you dont have to do that if you dont want to."
0,172,4,ONEILL,Hmm!
0,172,4,ONEILL,What do I do?
0,172,4,CARTER,Sit down.
0,172,4,ONEILL,Now what?
0,172,4,DANIEL,Youre supposed to have the ability to fly this thing.
0,172,4,CARTER,With your mind. Try not to think about the past.
0,172,4,DANIEL,Or the future.
0,172,4,DANIEL,"Oh, you so have to let us go with you!"
0,172,4,CARTER,Please!
0,172,5,KAWALSKY,Put those on.
0,172,5,DANIEL,How come we have to wear these and you dont?
0,172,6,HAMMOND,
0,172,6,ONEILL,"Yes, sir."
0,172,6,HAMMOND,"Never in my life would I have imagined giving that order! Are you absolutely certain about them, Colonel?"
0,172,7,ONEILL,"No, sir!"
0,172,7,HAMMOND,Good luck - and Godspeed.
0,172,7,KAWALSKY,All aboard.
0,172,7,ONEILL,"Hey - watch this! Oh, by the way - you do have the address to get us back home, correct?"
0,172,7,DANIEL,Yeah.
0,172,7,ONEILL,Good. Dial it up.
0,172,7,MCKAY,I give this no more than a fifty:fifty chance of working.
0,172,7,HAMMOND,"Well, according to the tape, it worked for eight years."
0,172,7,MCKAY,Hmm.
0,172,7,DANIEL,Wow!
0,172,7,MCKAY,"Well, Im certainly glad its not me going through that, uh ... thing."
0,172,8,ONEILL,Any idea what to expect?
0,172,8,CARTER,"Not really. According to the tape, were going to be demolecularised, transmitted over two thousand light years through subspace, and then, uh, rematerialised on the other side."
0,172,8,KAWALSKY,I did not need to know that!
0,172,8,OK.,
0,172,8,MCKAY,"Gateship One, youre go for launch."
0,172,9,ONEILL,Gateship?!
0,172,9,DANIEL,"Well, its a ship, it goes through the Gate, so ..."
0,172,10,ONEILL,Alright.
0,172,10,MCKAY,"What? Its a ship that goes through the Gate - its a Gateship! Well, I thought it was clever."
0,172,12,ONEILL,"Well, that was cool!"
0,172,12,DANIEL,I didnt feel anything.
0,172,12,KAWALSKY,Doesnt even feel like were pulling any gs.
0,172,12,CARTER,This thing must have inertial dampeners.
0,172,12,KAWALSKY,See any enemy troops when we came through?
0,172,12,ONEILL,"No, but that doesnt mean we werent detected."
0,172,12,CARTER,Is that a city?
0,172,12,ONEILL,Im gonna set her down in those trees.
0,172,13,DANIEL,Wait a minute - I thought the reason why we brought the ship was so we didnt have to walk.
0,172,13,CARTER,"We cant just fly into an alien city. The mission is stealth recon, meaning undetected."
0,172,14,ONEILL,Meaning shut up!
0,172,14,CARTER,Sorry.
0,172,14,KAWALSKY,"Connor, Mansfield, guard the ship. Cosworth - youre with us. Cmon, move out!"
0,172,14,DANIEL,Whyd we have to park so far away?!
0,172,16,KAWALSKY,"Seriously, why did we bring them?"
0,172,16,ONEILL,"Oh, I dunno. I guess I had a gut feeling."
0,172,16,KAWALSKY,Like Peru?
0,172,16,ONEILL,"Alright, that didnt work out so well."
0,172,16,KAWALSKY,Sierra Leone? Uganda?
0,172,16,ONEILL,"Alright, look - maybe the better question here is whyd you invite me on this dog and pony?"
0,172,16,KAWALSKY,"Well, lets just say I prefer my good instinct over yours."
0,172,16,ONEILL,Yeah.
0,172,16,DANIEL,Whats with the ...?
0,172,17,ONEILL,"Ah, sh..."
0,172,18,DANIEL,Hello? Anybody there?
0,172,18,CARTER,Were all here.
0,172,18,DANIEL,Where are we?
0,172,18,KAWALSKY,It looks like a prison cell.
0,172,18,DANIEL,Anyone seen my glasses?
0,172,18,CARTER,I think they must have taken them.
0,172,18,DANIEL,Why would they do that?
0,172,18,CARTER,Tealc!
0,172,18,DANIEL,From the tape?
0,172,18,TEALC,"If you know my name, then you know enough to fear me."
0,172,18,ONEILL,"Look, I know that this might sound a little crazy, but ..."
0,172,18,TEALC,Who are you?
0,172,18,DANIEL,"Hi, uh ... Uh, uh, were from the Tauri. Uh, we call it Earth. You see, we found this tape, um, from the past. You see, apparently, were a part of a team - um, the four of us , not the two of them . Were called SG-1. Now, we used this time device to go back in the past, and we screwed up the past and changed the future. See, youre not supposed to be still Apophis First Prime. Um, the Jaffa are supposed to be free and, um, we know that you think the Goauld are false gods."
0,172,19,ONEILL,That wasnt necessary!
0,172,19,TEALC,Speak of such blasphemy again and I will kill you where you stand.
0,172,19,ONEILL,"Look, I know this is a lot to throw at you all at one time and youve gotta put up a little show for the boys here, but the fact is, we know the truth."
0,172,19,DANIEL,"You see, its all on the tape. Uh, you have to see it - its, er, um, its, its in a - its in a camera that, um, um, you took from the bag that you took from me. If you bring it to me, I can, I can show you how it works and we can ... Sure, we could, we could go and see it over at, uh, wherever you wanna go."
0,172,21,TEALC,Kneel before your god.
0,172,21,DANIEL,Kneeling!
0,172,21,APOPHIS,Who are you?
0,172,21,DANIEL,"Names Daniel Jackson. Uh, if you give me back my eyeglasses, I could actually see you."
0,172,21,TEALC,He claims he is of the Tauri.
0,172,21,DANIEL,You werent supposed to tell him that.
0,172,21,APOPHIS,The Tauri have no chappaai.
0,172,21,DANIEL,"Oh! Sorry, guess I was wrong. Im sure your information is correct and ... In fact, Im usually quite wrong, quite unreliable actually. To be honest with you, Im insane."
0,172,21,APOPHIS,Speak! Bring him. I think there is much you can tell me.
0,172,21,DANIEL,"Well, if you wanna know about the early settlements of Mesopotamia, I am somewhat of an expert ..."
0,172,23,CARTER,Its been over an hour.
0,172,23,KAWALSKY,Maybe you shouldnt have said anything.
0,172,23,ONEILL,"All I said was, This is gonna sound a little crazy."
0,172,23,CARTER,"While there are obvious similarities, our timeline is different from the one in which Tealc came to believe that the Goauld were false gods."
0,172,23,ONEILL,Are you saying this guy might not turn?
0,172,23,CARTER,Its possible.
0,172,23,ONEILL,And youre telling me this now?!
0,172,24,TEALC,This one is strong.
0,172,24,APOPHIS,Leave us.
0,172,24,APOPHIS,You will tell me all that you know.
0,172,25,ONEILL,Whats goin on?
0,172,25,TEALC,Show me.
0,172,25,DANIEL,"Um, Tealc, you should say something."
0,172,26,TEALC,"The Jaffa are free. False god that he is, Apophis is long dead. A new medicine, tretonin, has liberated us from our dependence upon symbionts. The Jaffa have risen up as brothers and sisters and defeated the Goauld."
0,172,26,ALT-TEALC,What trickery is this?
0,172,26,CARTER,Its not a trick.
0,172,26,TEALC,"You have a son, Ryac, who is now married and a strong leader among the newly-formed Jaffa nation. If all these things have not come to pass, you must believe that the present in which you now live exists only because the past has been mistakenly altered. It must be restored."
0,172,27,CARTER,Please. You have to help us. The reason we came here was to get you so we could go back in time and fix things.
0,172,27,ONEILL,"Thats not true. We just wanna get out of here. Now, if you can help us, well do our best to help you."
0,172,27,TEALC,I cannot free you.
0,172,27,ONEILL,"What about our weapons, our vests? Can you get us those?"
0,172,29,ONEILL,"Easy, easy! Get outta here! Pissants! Hey."
0,172,29,DANIEL,I didnt tell them anything.
0,172,29,ONEILL,Good for you! Howre you feelin?
0,172,29,DANIEL,Not so good really.
0,172,29,ONEILL,Sorry. Maybe thisll make you feel better.
0,172,29,DANIEL,Argh! Howd you
0,172,29,CARTER,Tealc. He brought us the camera. I showed him the tape.
0,172,29,DANIEL,I dont think he can be trusted.
0,172,29,ONEILL,"He gave us our weapons back, thats a good start."
0,172,29,CARTER,Hes gonna meet us on the way back to the ship.
0,172,30,ONEILL,"Safety off, point and shoot. Not at me."
0,172,31,CARTER,I dont really like guns.
0,172,31,ONEILL,Neither do I. How do you feel about explosives?
0,172,31,CARTER,Those I like a little better.
0,172,31,KAWALSKY,Cover.
0,172,31,ONEILL,Lets go.
0,172,32,ONEILL,Airman? This is ONeill.
0,172,32,AIRMAN,We were starting to get worried.
0,172,32,ONEILL,Were on our way. ETA ten minutes.
0,172,33,ONEILL,Weve gotta get goin here. Weve got a whole battalion on our asses.
0,172,34,ONEILL,What the hell was that?
0,172,34,KAWALSKY,"Shoot him, Jack. Lets shoot him and get the hell out of here."
0,172,34,ONEILL,Whyd you do that?
0,172,34,TEALC,He was a Goauld. Apophis implanted him with a symbiont in order to gain access to the knowledge in his mind.
0,172,34,ONEILL,How do you know?
0,172,34,TEALC,I can sense it. Your friend did not give in to torture.
0,172,34,KAWALSKY,Hes lying.
0,172,34,ONEILL,"Why would he lie, Kawalsky?"
0,172,34,CARTER,"If he wanted us all dead, why arent we surrounded by Jaffa right now?"
0,172,34,KAWALSKY,We will be in a few seconds if we dont get the hell out of here now - and Im not taking him with us.
0,172,34,TEALC,Apophis has ordered a fleet of hatak vessels to the Tauri.
0,172,34,CARTER,Hes sending ships to Earth?
0,172,34,TEALC,The symbiont implanted within Daniel Jackson was a spy intended to accompany you. Apophis now knows what Daniel Jackson knew. He knows that you came in a ship. He knows that the Tauri is a threat.
0,172,34,KAWALSKY,How the hell do we know youre not a spy?
0,172,35,CARTER,His eyes glowed!
0,172,35,KAWALSKY,Hes dead.
0,172,35,ONEILL,Go! Go!
0,172,35,ONEILL,Kawalsky!
0,172,35,KAWALSKY,Go! Start it up!
0,172,35,CARTER,Kawalskys been hit!
0,172,35,TEALC,Go!
0,172,35,TEALC,Are you injured?
0,172,35,CARTER,"No. I-Ive just never seen anyone killed before. Daniel, and Kawalsky ... Oh my God! Youve been shot!"
0,172,35,TEALC,It will heal.
0,172,35,ONEILL,"Alright, weve got some problems here."
0,172,36,TEALC,Gliders.
0,172,36,ONEILL,"I cant shake em, either."
0,172,36,TEALC,The Gate will be well-guarded.
0,172,36,ONEILL,You know somethin? I dont think were gonna make it to the Gate.
0,172,37,CARTER,There is a way out. Was there a Stargate on this planet five thousand years ago?
0,172,37,TEALC,I believe so.
0,172,37,CARTER,I think you did it!
0,172,37,TEALC,What has he done?
0,172,37,CARTER,I think we just travelled back in time.
0,172,37,ONEILL,Check it out - dial Earth.
0,172,38,CARTER,"Well, this is definitely ancient Egypt!"
0,172,38,TEALC,Those hatak vessels bore the mark of Ra.
0,172,38,CARTER,He ruled on Earth during this period.
0,172,38,TEALC,It is likely we were detected on exiting the chappaai.
0,172,38,ONEILL,"Well, no ships on our tail, but I think well skedaddle anyway."
0,172,38,CARTER,Youre saying youre onboard with trying to fix the past?
0,172,38,ONEILL,"Well, we did kinda screw up our timeline, didnt we?"
0,172,38,CARTER,"Well, the only way to stop the invasion on Earth is to make sure that it never happens."
0,172,38,ONEILL,"Yeah - remind me how we do that, again?"
0,172,40,ONEILL,Alright - heres the plan. We make contact with the locals.
0,172,40,TEALC,And then?
0,172,40,ONEILL,Thats all I got so far.
0,172,40,CARTER,"Uh, any idea what time it is exactly?"
0,172,41,ONEILL,Three oclock.
0,172,41,CARTER,"Uh, sorry, I-I kinda meant what year."
0,172,41,ONEILL,"Well, you and Daniel said there was some kind of a failed rebellion."
0,172,41,CARTER,In 2995 BC.
0,172,41,BC?!,
0,172,41,CARTER,Colonel.
0,172,41,ONEILL,"Kidding. And call me Jack, willya?"
0,172,42,BOY,Maribe! Maribe! Maribe!
0,172,42,ONEILL,"Hey! Its alright, folks, we come in peace, nothin to be afraid of."
0,172,42,CARTER,"I doubt they speak English. (A young man approaches them and we realise that this is Katep, the man whose brother was killed by Ra in the temple in Part"
0,172,42,KATEP,Hello.
0,172,42,ONEILL,He does.
0,172,42,KATEP,Yes. I am Katep.
0,172,42,ONEILL,I am Jack.
0,172,42,KATEP,"ONeill. Colonel Carter, and Tealc."
0,172,42,ONEILL,Howd you know ...?
0,172,42,KATEP,"Please come with me. Ras patrols come through here often. They must not see you, especially you. Please, come."
0,172,43,KATEP,Please.
0,172,43,ONEILL,How do you know who we are?
0,172,43,KATEP,This is not the first time we have met.
0,172,43,CARTER,You knew the other SG-1 team.
0,172,43,KATEP,"Five years ago you came. You were witness to the death of my brother at the hands of Ra. After you were trapped here, we planned an uprising together."
0,172,43,CARTER,So much for causality!
0,172,43,TEALC,Ra is still here. We have seen his ship.
0,172,43,KATEP,Our first attempt at gathering forces for the rebellion did not go well. We had to expose ourselves to those who proved still loyal to Ra. You were captured and executed long before the plan could be finished.
0,172,43,ONEILL,Really? All of us?
0,172,43,KATEP,All but one.
0,172,43,DANIEL,"Well, this cant be a good sign."
0,172,43,ONEILL,Whys that?
0,172,43,DANIEL,Where am I?
0,172,43,ONEILL,Ancient Egypt?
0,172,43,DANIEL,"No, I mean the me from your timeline."
0,172,43,TEALC,I killed you.
0,172,43,DANIEL,Why?
0,172,43,TEALC,You were a Goauld spy.
0,172,43,DANIEL,Good reason.
0,172,43,CARTER,It was horrible.
0,172,43,DANIEL,"Yeah, Im sure. Why are you here?"
0,172,43,ONEILL,Yes - excellent question.
0,172,43,DANIEL,You dont know?
0,172,43,ONEILL,"Well, I thought I did, there, for a while, and then I realised I ... didnt."
0,172,43,DANIEL,"Well, I know why Im here."
0,172,43,ONEILL,Good! Lets start there.
0,172,43,DANIEL,We came back in time to get a ZPM.
0,172,43,CARTER,"Right! It was buried with the tape. Why is it so important? I think you were about to explain it but the, uh, the-the batteries on the camera ran out."
0,172,43,DANIEL,"Long story. Why dont you take a seat? Basically we got trapped here because you didnt want to affect the timeline, but ultimately you and you couldnt stand the idea of living out the rest of your lives under Ras rule without doing anything. We remembered there was a rebellion here on Earth - thats how the Gate got buried in the first place, so we figured what difference does it make if were involved or not? Unfortunately we never got a chance to execute the plan."
0,172,43,ONEILL,We heard.
0,172,43,DANIEL,"Yes. We tried to do too much too fast. Since then, Katep and I have been slowly building up an underground movement. I can only assume things dont go well because if youre here, you saw the tape and the future still needs fixing."
0,172,43,ONEILL,Somethin like that.
0,172,43,CARTER,"Oh, we didnt just see the tape. We saw the tablet."
0,172,43,DANIEL,What tablet?
0,172,43,CARTER,"Oh. The one you havent written yet, and put where the Stargate was supposed to be buried."
0,172,43,DANIEL,Supposed to be?
0,172,43,CARTER,"In our timeline, the rebellion that you planned actually works. Ra ends up leaving, and Earth is freed, but, uh, Ra takes the Stargate with him."
0,172,43,DANIEL,
0,172,43,CARTER,"Yes! The Gate is never found at Giza, and none of us join the Stargate programme - but you left a tablet in an obscure Egyptian dialect telling us the date of the rebellion and where to find the second Stargate in Antarctica."
0,172,43,DANIEL,Good for me! So youre here to make sure Ra doesnt take the Stargate.
0,172,43,ONEILL,Its a plan.
0,172,43,BOY,Daneel! Daneel! Jaffa!
0,172,43,KATEP,We must hide.
0,172,43,ONEILL,Where?
0,172,43,KATEP,In here.
0,172,45,ONEILL,Sweet!
0,172,45,JAFFA,Kree! Loknel!
0,172,46,DANIEL,Weve got secret stores of weapons like this in several positions throughout the region.
0,172,46,ONEILL,How many troops?
0,172,46,DANIEL,"Uh, a couple of thousand, but thats not really the issue. According to you, my own account of history says we win the revolt."
0,172,46,CARTER,We just need to make sure that the Gate stays here and gets buried.
0,172,46,DANIEL,Which means we have to steal it and hide it from Ra.
0,172,46,ONEILL,"But its out in the open, close to a ship."
0,172,46,TEALC,"Holding such a position against a hatak would be virtually impossible, even for a short period of time."
0,172,46,CARTER,"Also, the Gate is kinda heavy."
0,172,46,DANIEL,We also have a ship.
0,172,46,ONEILL,"Yes, but you see, the ship fits in the Gate, not the other way around."
0,172,46,CARTER,There has to be a way that we can cable the Gate to the ship - fly it out.
0,172,46,ONEILL,"Yeah, but weve still gotta get close to it without being detected."
0,172,46,DANIEL,"Well, thats easy. The ship has a cloaking device ... makes it invisible."
0,172,46,ONEILL,Youre telling me this now?!
0,172,46,DANIEL,I was sure I mentioned it on the tape.
0,172,47,TEALC,"If we were able to time our approach to co-ordinate with the uprising, we may yet have a chance."
0,172,47,CARTER,Well need to test the cloak. We took an awful lot of damage coming out of Chulak.
0,172,47,ONEILL,Because we didnt know about the damned cloak!
0,172,47,DANIEL,I was sure I mentioned it on the tape!
0,172,48,KATEP,They are gone!
0,172,49,CARTER,Do you ever wonder what your lifes gonna be like in the future?
0,172,49,ONEILL,"Wont really be my life, will it?"
0,172,49,CARTER,"No, but still. I mean, Ive led such a small and unimportant existence, I cant ever imagine being a hero who saves the planet."
0,172,49,ONEILL,"Well, we do have a time machine. We could go check it out."
0,172,49,CARTER,"No way. Weve already screwed up enough. Once were done with the Gate, we need to destroy the ship."
0,172,49,ONEILL,Seriously?
0,172,49,CARTER,Absolutely.
0,172,49,ONEILL,You mean we have to stay here?
0,172,49,CARTER,I wonder if the future me has a boyfriend?
0,172,50,ONEILL,So what do I do?
0,172,50,CARTER,"Um, try thinking invisible."
0,172,50,ONEILL,
0,172,51,CARTER,Nope!
0,172,52,TEALC,"Your strategy is good, but it does not work well as a distraction in our plan to steal the chappaai."
0,172,52,DANIEL,Wait - we know this plan works. If we alter it ...
0,172,52,KATEP,... we may fail.
0,172,52,DANIEL,"With this plan, the uprising succeeds and Ra leaves."
0,172,52,TEALC,"And Ra takes the chappaai. If we are to be successful in keeping Ra from taking the chappaai, we must focus the efforts of the rebellion on distracting him from it. Trust me."
0,172,53,ONEILL,Hows it goin?
0,172,53,CARTER,Ive never seen this kind of technology before.
0,172,53,ONEILL,"Hey, youre supposed to be a genius. Thats why I brought you along."
0,172,53,CARTER,Im working on it. I think the power relay was overloaded. I may be able to reroute the circuit to the control interface ... What?
0,172,53,ONEILL,Its just a little weird hearin that kind of stuff come out of someone so
0,172,54,CARTER,So what?
0,172,54,ONEILL,... hot.
0,172,54,CARTER,Really?
0,172,54,ONEILL,Yeah.
0,172,54,CARTER,"Wow. Um, its just you ... youre not the kind of guy that I usually attract."
0,172,54,ONEILL,No?
0,172,54,CARTER,No. Huh. God. Wow! This is kinda awkward.
0,172,54,ONEILL,"Yeah, its gettin there."
0,172,54,CARTER,Im kind of attracted to ... Daniel.
0,172,55,ONEILL,What?! Really?!
0,172,55,CARTER,Sorry.
0,172,55,ONEILL,"No, thats OK, n-no problem there, I, its just, you know ... first impressions, I kinda thought he was ... Never mind."
0,172,57,ONEILL,Carter. Hows it goin in there?
0,172,57,CARTER,"Uh, I think Im almost there."
0,172,57,ONEILL,Thats good. Were about to have some company. We have a patrol on its way here.
0,172,57,CARTER,Try it.
0,172,57,ONEILL,Nothings happening.
0,172,58,ONEILL,"Hey, guys, weve got a little problem here."
0,172,59,ONEILL,"Carter, forget it. Im just gonna take off."
0,172,60,ONEILL,Cmon! Now thats not workin.
0,172,60,CARTER,Oh boy! Try the cloak now.
0,172,61,CARTER,Did it work?
0,172,61,ONEILL,Apparently.
0,172,61,JAFFA,Shakna kree!
0,172,61,ONEILL,What?
0,172,61,ONEILL,"Go, go, go, go! Get down! Woah!"
0,172,61,CARTER,This could be a problem.
0,172,61,ONEILL,You think?!
0,172,61,CARTER,"If they penetrate the hull and hit the engines, the energy blasts could feed back into the power ..."
0,172,61,ONEILL,Carter!
0,172,61,CARTER,We could explode!
0,172,61,ONEILL,"Daniel, Tealc."
0,172,61,DANIEL,Were almost there!
0,172,62,DANIEL,"Well, this doesnt look good."
0,172,62,TEALC,Indeed.
0,172,62,DANIEL,Though it is quite ironic. This whole thing started because Sam didnt want to take the Jumper back from a Jaffa patrol.
0,172,63,CARTER,"Look, if we dont make it ..."
0,172,63,ONEILL,Wait a minute! You said you liked Daniel!
0,172,63,CARTER,"I lied. I just wanted to get to know you better. You see, usually Im a very cautious person and I tend to think things ..."
0,172,65,TEALC,Jaffa! Hear me! Ra is not a god! You can live free!
0,172,66,JAFFA,"Nakek, sholva!"
0,172,66,DANIEL,I dont think he bought it.
0,172,66,TEALC,Relinquish your weapons and surrender!
0,172,66,JAFFA,Keltek trey! Lo tnak!
0,172,66,DANIEL,"Yeah, I thought youd say that."
0,172,66,TEALC,Shaltek!
0,172,66,DANIEL,"Sam, Jack - its all clear. You can come out now."
0,172,67,ONEILL,In a minute.
0,172,67,CARTER,I can fix that.
0,172,68,DANIEL,"Uh, Jack, you should say something here."
0,172,68,ONEILL,"Um, college football is played on Saturdays; pro on Sundays; and there are no fish in my pond ... at all ... where I fish. Uh, I think that covers it for me."
0,172,69,CARTER,Is that correct?
0,172,69,ONEILL,"If it is, we dont do anything?"
0,172,69,CARTER,Apparently nothing we did affected the timeline.
0,172,69,ONEILL,But we didnt do anything.
0,172,69,CARTER,"Not yet. Apparently we were going to, two weeks from now, but now we dont have to."
0,172,69,ONEILL,Excellent! Thats it! I like it!
0,172,70,CARTER,
0,172,70,ONEILL,No! Ill take it. Theres a whole room full of geeks up there just dyin to get their hands on this. Youve got packin to do!
0,172,71,CARTER,This is great.
0,172,71,ONEILL,I told ya!
0,172,71,CARTER,I cant believe we didnt do it years ago.
0,172,71,ONEILL,"Yes, well, lets not dwell."
0,172,71,CARTER,Didnt that tape say there were no fish in your pond?
0,172,72,ONEILL,Close enough.
