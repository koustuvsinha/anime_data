0,174,0,"""AVALON II""",By Robert C. Cooper
0,174,1,VALA,Think! you are the expert on all things ancient.
0,174,1,JACKSON,"Yeah you didn't care about that two minutes ago. *mimicking* Oooh lets try this pot, how about this pot"
0,174,1,VALA,So then---
0,174,1,JACKSON,I'm thinking!!
0,174,1,VALA,Sorry could you possible think a little bit faster!
0,174,1,JACKSON,The universe is infinite
0,174,1,VALA,No doubt it's deliberately ironic that we're in an ever decreasing space.
0,174,1,JACKSON,"No it's taken from an ancient proverb, there is only one truth the universe is infinite."
0,174,1,VALA,How does that help us?
0,174,1,JACKSON,There is only one truth *points at silver pot* this pot say the treasure is in this pot.
0,174,1,VALA,It's not in either of them.
0,174,1,JACKSON,"I know we did it wrong so...we have to...see if we can do it again. *they put both lids back on* there is only one truth the universe is infinite. There forth the statement about the treasure being in this pot has to be false so the treasure must be in *opens gold lid, inside is a gold coin. The ceiling rises again and the door opens.*"
0,174,1,VALA,wow. Good job you know your ancient proverbs otherwise we'd been......Mitchell.
0,174,1,JACKSON,Teal'c
0,174,3,TEAL'C,Arghhh
0,174,3,MITCHELL,Yo feel free to jump in here anytime.
0,174,4,JACKSON,Teal'c!!
0,174,4,TEAL'C,Daniel Jackson!!
0,174,4,MITCHELL,Hey! We got a little problem in here.
0,174,4,JACKSON,Uh...what's the puzzle?
0,174,4,MITCHELL,There's eight stones with symbols on them and some ancient writing. I think it is --
0,174,4,JACKSON,Describe the writing.
0,174,4,MITCHELL,"Uh...U with a square over it. Chair with a square, Upside- down backwards L call that 7, Squares unevenly stacked. That chair thingy again. Big N and fat face?"
0,174,4,JACKSON,Uh reflect...it means reflect.
0,174,4,MITCHELL,reflect??
0,174,4,JACKSON,"Uh...reflect, reflect, reflect...reflect a meaningful path. Put those pieces to reflect a path to enlightenment"
0,174,4,MITCHELL,Yeah. That tells me exactly nothing!!
0,174,4,JACKSON,I'm sorry I can't help if I can't see the symbols on the stones you're suppose to put in order.
0,174,4,MITCHELL,"Reflect. Double 8, 4 reflect 8...*picks up stone, stops, notices if he covers part of symbol on stone, makes a four, either way.* 4 *gets to work*...6."
0,174,5,JACKSON,Teal'c!!
0,174,5,VALA,Look I didn't hear any screaming or squishing sounds. So...
0,174,6,JACKSON,You did it.
0,174,6,MITCHELL,Yeah. Thanks the symbols are actually the numbers 1 through 8 and their mirror image.
0,174,7,MITCHELL,Alright. We passed the tests so...this should work.
0,174,8,MITCHELL,Should've known it wouldn't be that easy.
0,174,9,MITCHELL,"Weird. *another few clashes, as he rounds next to Jackson and Vala.*"
0,174,9,JACKSON,Uh...you...uh...done this before?
0,174,9,MITCHELL,uh...fight a knight in shining armor. No can't say that I have.
0,174,9,JACKSON,Well you're doing good
0,174,9,MITCHELL,Yeah...took a little fencing in college.
0,174,10,MITCHELL,Ooook...need a little help.
0,174,11,TEAL'C,It appears to be a hologram.
0,174,12,MITCHELL,Jesus!
0,174,12,VALA,I don't think it actually cut you.
0,174,12,MITCHELL,"Well it hurt like hell. *gets to his feet defending against another blow, the second one the knight slices the sword right through Mitchell's arm, he drops*"
0,174,12,VALA,I don't know. I don't think he's actually that good.
0,174,12,MITCHELL,"*grabs sword, obviously in a lot of pain* Ok so I flunked fencing. *gets up, defending himself once again, does well until the knight hits him in the leg. And he's down again*"
0,174,12,TEAL'C,Colonel Mitchell. The sword. *Mitchell throws it to Teal'c but it passes straight through him*
0,174,13,VALA,ok. That thing is going to kill him!
0,174,13,JACKSON,everybody get to the rings.
0,174,15,THERAPIST,Ok...that's enough for today.
0,174,15,MITCHELL,"No I can do this. *pushes away therapist, back to present, and pushes away Teal'c*"
0,174,16,VALA,Yeah
0,174,17,MITCHELL,Oh come on...that's got to be it. *Teal'c heads over helping him up*
0,174,17,VALA,I don't understand we solved the riddles. *Teal'c looks at her* well he solved one...and he solved one...and he won the fight.
0,174,17,MITCHELL,And what? Nothing?
0,174,17,JACKSON,But you're the only one who defeated the knight. That sword was obviously designed to sense who ever pulled it from the stone. What if there's sensors detecting us.
0,174,17,TEAL'C,Are you suggesting that we should leave?
0,174,17,JACKSON,It's worth a try.
0,174,17,MITCHELL,"*little out of breath* Alright. *walks over to console, the other move to centre*"
0,174,17,JACKSON,If nothing happens just join us.
0,174,18,MITCHELL,ahhhhh *hits console buttons.*
0,174,19,JACKSON,What happened?
0,174,19,MITCHELL,the whole place is collapsing we must have done something wrong.
0,174,20,JACKSON,What'cha take?
0,174,20,VALA,what?
0,174,20,JACKSON,Truth of spirit.
0,174,20,VALA,I resent...
0,174,20,JACKSON,Truth of spirit. What did you take?
0,174,20,VALA,*pulls coin out of bra.*
0,174,21,MITCHELL,Worth it.
0,174,22,MITCHELL,We are not gonna let her keep that are we?
0,174,22,JACKSON,"*looks up and over at Vala, whose obviously heard Mitchell* No."
0,174,22,MITCHELL,Good. *Vala not looking happy* alright...figures room full of golden jewels and Doctor Daniel Jackson find the one book. So what's it about?
0,174,22,JACKSON,Uh...actually it's a story. It's a...written like fiction. *kid with his book awww*
0,174,22,MITCHELL,Once upon a time...
0,174,22,JACKSON,uh...once upon a time there was a race of people that were on a great journey through space across the universe they were called the Alterra um...after much time...I think this means thousands of years... they found a great belt of stars.
0,174,22,MITCHELL,...And they lived happily ever after.
0,174,23,TEAL'C,Have you found something Daniel Jackson?
0,174,23,JACKSON,It says...that the Alterraians named their new home Avalon and that they built many astriaporta.
0,174,23,MITCHELL,*stands* Stargates.
0,174,23,JACKSON,Yes.
0,174,23,VALA,the Ancients built the stargates. *all three look at her*
0,174,23,JACKSON,Uh...well...it stands to reason that they weren't always called the ancients.
0,174,23,MITCHELL,What do you care? You got your treasure.
0,174,23,VALA,"*emphasizing thinking* mmmmm...let's see what's of more value a few gold trinkets that apparently I won't be able to keep. *throws a gold necklace, getting up* or...previously undiscovered secrets about... the gate builders *walks over* the most powerful race ever to inhabit the galaxy."
0,174,23,JACKSON,You realize what this could mean...
0,174,23,MITCHELL,"*down of realization* whoa! ...we've always presumed that the ancients were the first evolution of humans in this galaxy...But... but this...*moves hands over book* this is the first evidence suggesting they came here long ago from somewhere far, far away."
0,174,23,MITCHELL,Yes
0,174,23,MARKS,"Colonel Mitchell! *he's found some odd looking thing, that's big round and has a spear type of diamond coming out of the top, they all head over*"
0,174,23,MITCHELL,"*grins, huge looks at Vala*...one of these things is not like the others."
0,174,24,JACKSON,"It's much, much more than that...we know the ancients left our galaxy for Pegasus and returned later when they lost the war with the wraith but what happened to them?"
0,174,24,LANDRY,I thought they ascended...?
0,174,24,JACKSON,"well...some did that we know of...but...what if the others went home? Even if they didn't, the book I read suggested that the alterraians left civilization behind."
0,174,24,LANDRY,and your point is?
0,174,24,JACKSON,"my point is that we haven't met a single living ancient who has been willing to share their knowledge freely with us and there could be an entire advance civilization of them out there somewhere in another galaxy. I mean isn't that why we're doing this? All of this? The Stargate program, the budget? Isn't that so we can go and meet new races gather advanced technology possibly learn about ourselves in the process?"
0,174,24,VALA,Oh come on you do it to meet women
0,174,24,MITCHELL,She has a point sir.
0,174,24,LANDRY,I've been thinking I need to get out on an off world mission or two.
0,174,24,MITCHELL,*they get on lift.* Yeah...just to get...a feel for it.
0,174,24,LANDRY,Always do everything you ask of those you command.
0,174,24,MITCHELL,Patten.
0,174,24,LANDRY,very good.
0,174,24,MITCHELL,good movie. *doors close*
0,174,24,JACKSON,Laugh if you want to but I believe finding these Alterraians and where they came from should be our top Priority from this point forward. They are...the gate builders.
0,174,24,LANDRY,Nobody's laughing Dr Jackson. The universe is a big place... tell me where they are and how to get there and I'll order you to go.
0,174,25,JACKSON,"I'm...I'm...I'm not saying this is gonna be easy...I mean if... if they're from a distant galaxy, our network of stargates might not even connect. And even if it does we know the massive power requirements necessary to dial Pegasus and they're relatively close... in intergalactic terms. But on the bright side uh...according to the text we found in the *they stop outside Landry's office* Glastonbury cavern the ancient device we discovered may be capable of intergalactic communication."
0,174,25,LANDRY,Thank you Dr Jackson I'm sure you'll keep me posted. *nods at Mitchell* Colonel.
0,174,25,MITCHELL,General. *Landry heads into his office shutting door*
0,174,26,MITCHELL,He has no idea what you just said.
0,174,27,LANDRY,Someone want to tell me why *Looks at Vala* she's still on my base? *to Mitchell* And uh...yes I did
0,174,28,VALA,Well I think its incredible *Grins*
0,174,29,RAK'NOR,The Jaffa of the Omakna equal as many as all the other regional coalitions...and they strongly support Gerak.
0,174,29,TEAL'C,of this I am aware.
0,174,29,RAK'NOR,"if we allow them even one more vote based on unconfirmed military strength, the council will be in Gerak's hands. Until a proper inspection-..."
0,174,29,TEAL'C,Rak'nor!
0,174,29,RAK'NOR,I'm sorry. We are all working very hard. it just seems as though Gerak is winning.
0,174,29,TEAL'C,Bra'tac and Rya'c are negotiating with coalitions who have yet to declare their allegiance.
0,174,29,RAK'NOR,I did not fight for the freedom of all jaffa only to have it corrupted by a few power hungry individuals.
0,174,29,TEAL'C,nor did I.
0,174,29,RAK'NOR,I just do not understand why you have chosen to spend so much time with the Tau'ri... at such a critical stage.
0,174,29,TEAL'C,my friends from the Tau'ri are largely responsible for the Jaffa being free...and as thanks they have been treated with mistrust and disrespect. Until all Jaffa see that the old ways are not the future I will do whatever I need to do to enlighten them.
0,174,29,RAK'NOR,And how does chasing ancient history do that?
0,174,29,TEAL'C,Ancient knowledge is what defeated the Goa'uld and the replcators... and I believe that one day it will unite the Jaffa in a nation of peace. I will prove it. *walks off*
0,174,29,RAK'NOR,I hope so.
0,174,30,VALA,I have been around the galaxy long enough to know that knowledge is power...and understanding the technology that was left behind by the ancients is the most powerful knowledge around.
0,174,30,JACKSON,...*tense* and if you think I'm gonna stay linked with you for the rest of my natural---
0,174,30,MITCHELL,Focus! Maybe we should focus... on the task at hand...
0,174,30,LEE,Yeah *clears throat* well...the device obviously has a power source and...uh I don't think it's been depleted.
0,174,30,JACKSON,"*takes a deep breath* ok...when I read this was a communication device, I realized that the shape of these recess spaces looked familiar. *picks up black stone* these stones are actually an ancient form of communication device that links their users psychically, allowing them to see through each others eyes. it appears that they are actually meant to be used in conjunction with this terminal."
0,174,30,MITCHELL,So...what happens when you attach the stones?
0,174,30,JACKSON,We're gonna find out.
0,174,30,LEE,Uh...these stones were originally set for General O'Neill and one... Joe Spencer.
0,174,30,JACKSON,Barber from Indiana.
0,174,30,MICHELL,Yeah weird guy. I read the file.
0,174,30,LEE,"...uh well...anyway after a lot of tedious, although I must say, ultimately very brilliant...uh work...if I do say so myself. *Jackson puts hand to his shoulder to get him on path* I was able to reset the stones."
0,174,30,MITCHELL,Don't they have to be activated by someone with the ancient Gene? Same file.
0,174,30,LEE,"Well...that's what we thought at first, but no... like a lot of ancient technology the stones actually just have to be initialized."
0,174,30,MITCHELL,By someone with the gene. That's a guess.
0,174,30,LEE,No you're right. Uh...which these obviously have been.
0,174,30,MITCHELL,So...anyone of us can...take the pony ride?
0,174,30,LEE,Ye
0,174,30,JACKSON,yeah I figured that was gonna be me. I mean I did... miss the Daedalus for this. So...
0,174,30,MITCHELL,You're gonna... dine out on that for a while?
0,174,30,JACKSON,Ya yea...like you wouldn't believe.
0,174,30,MITCHELL,Well...no ones gonna make an argument against that. You are the worlds foremost *makes quotation marks with hands* expert of the ancients but we've got two stones.
0,174,30,VALA,*walks around Jackson picking up other stone* yes. And this ones mine. Thank you.
0,174,30,MITCHELL,Excuse me...how do you figure that?
0,174,30,VALA,well Daniel and I are linked. *rests arm on Jackson's shoulder*
0,174,30,JACKSON,I'll just point out for the record we don't have to be... *pushes her arm of his shoulder*
0,174,30,VALA,He's only guessing that this device is for communication. What if it's a transporter of some kind and he gets whisked away and can't get back?
0,174,30,LEE,"Actually we have done a fair bit of research on this device and I can say with absolute...relative *Vala grins* certainty *gives up, sighs* oh look... we have studied devices like this for years and at some point ultimately you jut have to turn it on."
0,174,30,JACKSON,I'm gonna have it a try.
0,174,30,VALA,where he goes I go.
0,174,30,JACKSON,I'm not going anywhere.
0,174,30,VALA,So he think.
0,174,30,JACKSON,*through gritted teeth* it's a communication device.
0,174,30,LEE,I'm going to watch from the observation room. *head off*
0,174,30,MITCHELL,Alright. Good luck *follows Dr Lee*
0,174,30,VALA,So what so we do?
0,174,30,JACKSON,well...I'm guessing we just put these two stones in any two of these spots.
0,174,30,VALA,Any two?
0,174,30,JACKSON,"Well there aren't any makings to indicate otherwise so...any two. And...*they both put in their stones, Vala closing her eyes waiting, the spear thing flashes and the two fall to the ground*"
0,174,30,MITCHELL,*grabs phone* Med team to science lab
0,174,31,JACKSON,"Hello? *Vala turns, buts its not Vala we see but the body she is inhabiting* please don't be afraid *then to Jackson, but instead of Jackson we see the body he's inhabiting* My name is Daniel Jackson."
0,174,31,VALA,It's me. Vala.
0,174,31,JACKSON,OK...Not a transporter.
0,174,31,VALA,Where are we?
0,174,31,JACKSON,I don't know.
0,174,32,JACKSON,But I think we're in them. *Vala pokes her cheek*
0,174,33,LAM,Blood pressure and Heart rate are normal. Pupils are slightly dilated. Now we're sure this is because of the device? They also passed out before when they were separated because of the bracelet.
0,174,33,LEE,The reaction was virtually instantaneous after the device was activated... Anyway there's no discernable energy...so...
0,174,33,LAM,And we found no contagions...alright...*removes head of Hazmat*....I wanna get an EEG going but my first impression here is that they're in some kind of sleep state...
0,174,33,MITCHELL,*grabs intercom as Lee removes head of his haz mat* Maybe we should disconnect the stones.
0,174,33,LEE,uh...for all we know this could be perfectly normal...I mean this could be the way the device actually works.
0,174,33,LAM,And could you give me some time here before we go messing around with that thing anymore?
0,174,33,LEE,*gives her a look* I wouldn't call it messing around.
0,174,33,LAM,Look for all we disconnecting the stones...could put them in further jeopardy.
0,174,34,MITCHELL,So how are things on Dakara?
0,174,34,TEAL'C,about as well as here.
0,174,35,VALA,I don't understand. This is...an odd communication device....I mean...I can't talk to this...*looks down* poor woman...I...I have no access to her... her mind...her thoughts...her memories. I'm just...inside of her looking out through her eyes.
0,174,35,JACKSON,Yeah...Jack and Joe Spencer described the experience as having visions of what was happening to the other.
0,174,35,VALA,Were they ever in total control of each others bodies?
0,174,35,JACKSON,No. but they weren't using the stones in conjunction with the ancient terminal either. Its possible it was meant to work this was so that we can...communicate with others without intruding on the minds of those we're connected to. They're just... temporary transmitters.
0,174,35,VALA,*walks over to mirror* Do you think we're actually in another galaxy? *pokes at her chest*
0,174,35,JACKSON,I don't know.
0,174,35,VALA,why these people?
0,174,35,JACKSON,I don't know. *reading a plaque in ancient*
0,174,35,VALA,well maybe its just me but...this house...these...*short laugh* clothes...*walks over to him* we don't look the way I'd expect the ancients to look.
0,174,35,JACKSON,No.
0,174,35,VALA,what do you suppose their names are?
0,174,35,JACKSON,Harrid and Sallis.
0,174,35,VALA,*frowns at him* How do you know that?
0,174,35,JACKSON,"oh...cause it um...it says so um...*points at plaque* right here. It says *moving his hand along works* ""this is the *mumbles* home of Harrid and Sallis ciseru"""
0,174,35,VALA,wait I missed that...you...you mumbled it.
0,174,35,JACKSON,No I didn't.
0,174,35,VALA,well...you said something...that I couldn't understand.
0,174,35,JACKSON,Well... I...I didn't say it cause I... I don't really know what it means. So I don't want to say it out loud cause I don't ...know what it means.
0,174,35,VALA,well go on...
0,174,35,JACKSON,*not looking at her* Nuptial...it means nuptial.
0,174,35,VALA,*grins* as in we're...?
0,174,35,JACKSON,married. Yah. Lets go look outside.
0,174,36,VALA,Not quite what I imagined when I...pictured a civilization of gate builders.
0,174,36,JACKSON,No...Something tell me this is not the same people who built a spaceship capable of traveling across the universe.
0,174,36,MAN,Above the Sun! Harrid. Sallis.
0,174,36,VALA,*Quietly to Jackson* What?
0,174,36,JACKSON,uh...I think that means good morning. *waves to the Man* Above the sun to you.
0,174,36,VALA,*through gritted teeth but smiling at the man and his wife* Above the sun?
0,174,36,JACKSON,uh...I think he's speaking ancient...uh I think the communicators translating for us.
0,174,36,VALA,I couldn't read the sign.
0,174,36,JACKSON,maybe it only works for spoken language.
0,174,36,MAN,see you at prostration.
0,174,36,JACKSON,*hesitates* prostration it is.
0,174,36,VALA,prostration it is.
0,174,37,VALA,"*cuddles up to Jackson, who places are round her, forced grin* so what do you want to do Harrid? Or is it Sallis?"
0,174,37,JACKSON,*Moves her away an inch* people are starting to stare.
0,174,37,VALA,well...shall we walk about and try to appear normal? Hmmm?
0,174,37,JACKSON,*takes her hand hooking it through his arm. They head off* nope. Not what I was expecting at all.
0,174,37,VALA,me neither.
0,174,37,JACKSON,on the Brightside I think he was looking at me when he said Harrid.
0,174,37,VALA,please he was staring at me the whole time.
0,174,38,LANDRY,"Hey! Come in. *she steps in,* now I can't decide...if I...if I like the desk...here? *waves hands above desk looking at her*"
0,174,38,LAM,*shrugs* where else are you going to put it... out on the hall?
0,174,38,LANDRY,*chuckles*
0,174,38,LAM,Daniel and Vala are stable. Based on rapid eye movements and brainwave patterns I'm guessing it's actually some kind of induced dream like condition.
0,174,38,LANDRY,"Dr Jackson believes that...the device was used for long range communication...is it possible that's what they're doing? Talking to someone, somewhere...out there?"
0,174,38,LAM,I don't know.
0,174,38,LANDRY,I'm heading to the mess...
0,174,38,LAM,I'm good. thanks. I should get back to Daniel and Vala.
0,174,38,LANDRY,"Oh...course...Just keep me posted. *she nods, starts to head off* Caroline. *she turns, he seems a little off...* You seem to be... settling in okay..."
0,174,38,LAM,"I don't know if I'll ever get used to this place its pretty uh... *searches for right word, sighs*"
0,174,38,LANDRY,Yeah.
0,174,38,LAM,yeah...and...uh...working for you just makes the whole thing just that more bizarre.
0,174,38,LANDRY,Well You didn't have to take the job you know...
0,174,38,LAM,are you kidding...who could refuse it? Besides at the time General O'Neill didn't tell me you'd be my boss.
0,174,38,LANDRY,He's funny that way.
0,174,38,LAM,hmmm...Ha Ha. By the way the desk looks fine the way it is. *heads off*
0,174,38,LANDRY,hmmm...really?
0,174,38,LAM,*from down the hall* You never were happy with anything the way it was.
0,174,39,ADMINISTRATOR,All hallow the Ori.
0,174,39,CROWD,"All hallow the Ori. ADMINISTRATOR: On their great power we shall meditate here in this day. *Gets down on his knees with book, in from on torch.*"
0,174,39,JACKSON,*walking through crowd* Prostration it is.
0,174,40,FANIS,"we must meet. By the portical of light, at the hour of beligh. Speak not."
0,174,40,ADMINISTRATOR,"Oh greatness that is the Ori. You guide us and give meaning to our daily lives. We beseech you, give us strength."
0,174,40,CROWD,*repeat* All Hallow the Ori...All Hallow the Ori.
0,174,41,VALA,Well...that was fun. Six hours of Prostration. *Jackson starts snooping round* why don't we just...tell someone who we are and what's going on...I mean isn't that the whole point of this...to communicate?
0,174,41,JACKSON,I don't think these people are going to entirely understand. Hey did you hear what that guy said to me when we first came to the service.
0,174,41,VALA,Something about meeting...
0,174,41,JACKSON,Yeah at the portical of light on the hour of beligh.
0,174,41,VALA,*frustrated* What's that suppose to mean?
0,174,41,JACKSON,"I have no idea. *picks up ladle, looking at it, then puts it down*"
0,174,41,VALA,*little calmer* what are you looking for?
0,174,42,VALA,"Well... I have a more pressing question. Do you have any idea how we're suppose to *Jackson throws some stuff out of cupboard at her, she shoves them away* detach from them?"
0,174,42,JACKSON,"*stops thinks, shakes head* No...That's another thing that's got me worried...have you tried?"
0,174,42,VALA,"*nods, starts pulling of shoes* mmmm nothing."
0,174,42,JACKSON,I mean... it doesn't seem to be something that I can just will to happen.
0,174,43,VALA,Maybe its about removing the stones from the device on earth.
0,174,43,JACKSON,Yeah unfortunately we can't tell the people on earth that we need them to... remove them...I guess we'll just have to wait for them to figure it our for themselves.
0,174,43,VALA,Maybe they have already and it had no effect.
0,174,43,JACKSON,*stops looks at her* I'm just gonna rule out that possibility. *walks over to drawers*
0,174,43,VALA,*Starts pulling up mattress* do you think these people are in our bodies? *finds book*
0,174,43,JACKSON,I don't know...I mean...this can't be how the technology is supposed to work.
0,174,43,VALA,"*looks in book, little surprised shuts it* hey. *shows him the book*"
0,174,43,JACKSON,"*kneels down by bed, still searching* Yeah...it's the book that some of the villagers were walking around with. It says on the front...uh...""The... book of the Origins, blessed are the Ori"""
0,174,43,VALA,I think you should take a look at it.
0,174,43,JACKSON,Oh I think I've seen enough...I mean...prostration for six hours...*looks under bed* Give us strength. *looks up* you know its all very clear.
0,174,43,VALA,I think you'd find it really interesting.
0,174,43,JACKSON,Yeah...when did you start being able to read ancient?
0,174,43,VALA,I can't. *Jackson frowns* but this looked familiar.
0,174,45,FANIS,Thank those fill of value. I was worried when you did not meet me.
0,174,45,JACKSON,Yes...sorry about that.
0,174,45,FANIS,Why did you not meet me? *looks at Vala* and why are you not sharing leaves with the administrators wife?
0,174,45,VALA,*hesitates* I...forgot.
0,174,45,PHANIS,We are already suspected we must not alter our behavior...
0,174,45,JACKSON,Suspected of what?
0,174,45,FANIS,Harrid what ails you? Did I not know better I would fear you were trying to entrap me.
0,174,45,JACKSON,No I wowo-wouldn't dream of trying to
0,174,45,VALA,Entrap you? How?
0,174,45,FANIS,Stop this. please.
0,174,45,JACKSON,"Ok...you know what? Uh...please...would you...would you sit *Fanis sits, to Vala* go with me. My name is Daniel Jackson and I am in the mind of Harrid. I am able to speak through him by use of a communication technology that we believe was first constructed and used by a race known as the Alterrans"
0,174,45,VALA,and I'm Vala...Manderan
0,174,45,JACKSON,How do you do?
0,174,45,FANIS,*laughs* by the stars. Forgive me...I am Fanis.
0,174,45,JACKSON,*happy faces shared between him and Vala* uh...nice to meet you...ummm we're from a...a place called earth.
0,174,45,FANIS,Can I speak with Harrid?
0,174,45,JACKSON,No...ehum... his conscious appears to be suppressed so long as we're connected.
0,174,45,FANIS,Harrid always suspected the stones were a means of communication.
0,174,45,JACKSON,You know about the stones?
0,174,45,FANIS,we are curators...investigators of the past. The stones were discovered some time ago in what we believe are the remains of an ancestral burial ground not far from here.
0,174,45,JACKSON,Why are you hiding them? JACKSON: Both?
0,174,45,FANIS,Such investigation is sacrilege.
0,174,45,JACKSON,you're not allowed to investigate your own history?
0,174,45,FANIS,If such a history contradicts the book of origin.
0,174,45,JACKSON,You're heretics.
0,174,45,FANIS,We have uncovered evidence that we believe proves a race of humans predates out supposed creating by the ori.
0,174,45,VALA,Excuse me...Daniel...what is these gods...the ori...are the people left behind by the Alterraians.
0,174,45,JACKSON,You think they ascended?
0,174,45,VALA,"It's possible...the alterraians left a long, long time ago. And what we know of... the ancients they learned to evolve and ascend. What if the people who remained here did too..."
0,174,45,JACKSON,that would mean these people are a subsequent evolution of humans which is apparently what happened in our galaxy after the ancients we know ascended.
0,174,45,VALA,And it would explain why they're not as advanced as we might expect.
0,174,45,JACKSON,No...but the religion doesn't suit the profile. The ascended beings I know don't pose as gods...I mean that's the one explicit rule that they do follow... Is that they don't meddle in the affairs of the lower planes existence.
0,174,45,FANIS,The Ori are not posing. We do not doubt their power...just their word and intention. The power is as real as the strength and belief in all followers. *looks at Vala* You are late for leaves with the administrators wife...Sallis and she are acquaintances.
0,174,45,VALA,So what should I do?
0,174,45,FANIS,Can you not disconnect and allow Sallis to return?
0,174,45,JACKSON,No...apparently we can't do that.
0,174,45,FANIS,then you must pose as Sallis...or we will be discovered.
0,174,45,VALA,*Jackson gives her a worried look* I can do that.
0,174,46,RAK'NOR,The council has already taken respite. The vote was quick. I delivered yours by proxy. Gerak's motion was resolved by a slim majority. The jaffa will be ruled by high council. Votes will be attributed to the various coalition representatives based on military assets.
0,174,46,TEAL'C,Making Gerak...
0,174,46,RAK'NOR,the new leader of the Jaffa nation.
0,174,47,FANIS,You said that the Ori may have ascended...what does that mean?
0,174,47,JACKSON,Where we come from some people who... use to look a lot like us evolved physically and mentally so much they...found a way to shed their physical body and *pours* live as energy on another higher plane of existence...some called it enlightenment and came with it a much greater understanding of the universe and all its knowledge...now this happened a long time ago and I believe that those people may have originally come from here.
0,174,47,FANIS,And those ascended beings as you call them...do not guide you and ask that you worship them?
0,174,47,JACKSON,No...in fact they believe so strongly in free will that they.... would not even intervene and use their knowledge even if it meant the destruction of an entire galaxy full of us regular humans.
0,174,47,FANIS,Such is not the case with the Ori.
0,174,47,JACKSON,Yes so they...ask that you worship them...and yet...conceal the truth of your existence from you?
0,174,47,FANIS,That is not all.
0,174,47,JACKSON,What are you gonna do?
0,174,47,FANIS,we are gathering as much evidence as we can. Our hope is that one day we will have enough proof...*sighs* to convince even the most devout believers. In the meantime... we meet in secret and share with those who we trust with what we have learned. We keep hidden those artifacts which prove our claims in case one or more of us our discovered.
0,174,48,FANIS,"A few...our numbers are growing. Some believe that the fact that we have not yet been discovered is further proof that the Ori are not all powerful and all knowing...others wonder us they are not just giving us the opportunity to see the error of our ways and repent. *sounds outside the windows, Fanis heads over looks out* A crowd gathers at the arra."
0,174,48,JACKSON,That's an Altar?
0,174,48,FANIS,I cannot be seen with you.
0,174,49,JACKSON,excuse me
0,174,49,ADMINISTRATOR,"And so said Dzaraya before the battle of ages. He spoke to the sky and said. ""And the people shall deliver unto you the wicked for your divine judgment where their sins shall be weighed in the balance of all that is just and true."""
0,174,49,VALA,Let go off me!! Get your hands off me!! *Two men drag her towards the altar...she's kicking and shouting.* Daniel!!!
0,174,49,JACKSON,What happened?
0,174,49,VALA,It didn't go so well...*the men chain her to the centre*
0,174,49,JACKSON,"Yeah I can see that. *he walks forward* excuse me...*two men grab him, pulling him back he tries to fight them off*"
0,174,49,ADMINISTRATOR,Harrid stand back. Sallis has been overcome.
0,174,49,JACKSON,No she hasn't... if you'll just let me explain...listen to me!! *in the background Fanis runs off*
0,174,49,ADMINISTRATOR,Fear not...for the Ori see all...outside and within. If your heart is pure and your devotion unwavering they will protect you. They'll cleanse your being and you'll be taken to be with them forever. If not...may the fire burn you down to the ground and lay you in the dust.
0,174,49,VALA,*scared* fire?
0,174,50,ADMINISTRATOR,Hallowed are the Ori.
0,174,52,LAM,"Heart rate is 140, she's in distress."
0,174,52,LEE,Daniels heart rate and BP are increasing too.
0,174,52,MITCHELL,*walks into room* pull the stones.
0,174,52,LEE,*walks over to device tugging on stones hard* I can't
0,174,53,JACKSON,What the hell did you say?
0,174,53,VALA,"*panicked* I think at first it was what I didn't say. You see Apparently there's a blessing you're suppose to recite over the leaves before you drink, which nobody warned me about. Then I think its what I did say. I was trying to politely explain what was going on and then his *pokes head at Administrator* wife started screaming and accusing me of being overcome at which point I suggested that she might want to think about procreating...with herself"
0,174,53,JACKSON,
0,174,55,LAM,Ok...this is getting worse. I'm administering a sedative. Hopefully it'll calm things down.
0,174,56,VALA,*really frightened* Daniel!!!
0,174,56,JACKSON,Okay listen to me! Listen to me you have to believe me!! You're killing an innocent person!
0,174,56,VALA,Daniel!!!! *screaming* AHHHHHH!!!!
0,174,56,ADMINISTRATOR,Blessed are those that deliver us from evil!
0,174,56,VALA,arghhh!!!
0,174,57,NO!! NO!!,
0,174,57,VALA,"aghhhhhh!!! *entire body erupts into flames, her screaming still heard, Jackson ducks his head unable to watch*"
0,174,58,LAM,She's in defib! Code blue! *grabs paddles* Charging at 200
0,174,59,LEE,No no...Don't shoot!!
0,174,59,MITCHELL,You got a better Idea?
0,174,59,LEE,You might... you might cause a surge...you could kill them both. You might detonate the power source...now now...come on!!
0,174,59,LAM,clear!! *Nothing*
0,174,61,LAM,"Charge to 60 Clear!! *Landry enters Observation room, watching.* still in defib, charging again. Clear. *checks Vala's wrist* I've got not pulse she's gone into Asystole. I'm calling it."
0,174,61,MITCHELL,she's dead?
0,174,61,LAM,I'm sorry.
0,174,64,LAM,His vitals are stable for the moment.
0,174,64,MTICHELL,You Still can't pry the stones off?
0,174,64,LEE,no.
0,174,64,MITCHELL,and you don't want me to shoot it...
0,174,64,LEE,No.
0,174,64,MITCHELL,then how do we unplug this thing?
0,174,64,LEE,I don't know...
0,174,64,MITCHELL,Brilliant
0,174,64,LAM,at the very least we need to find a way to get that bracelet off of Dr Jackson. They're still linked and without Vala he'll probably--*Vala's Life signs start to spike* she's got a heart beat.
0,174,65,VALA,"*voice quiet, frightened* Daniel?"
0,174,65,JACKSON,*moves hand to her face* you ok?
0,174,65,VALA,"*shaking moves into Jackson's arms cuddling to him, he holds her tight.*...I've got tingles all over. And don't flatter yourself I'm pretty sure its not you. *Tears fill her eyes and fall down her face as Jackson rubs her back*"
0,174,65,JACKSON,*to Prior* Thank you.
0,174,65,PRIOR,Thank the Ori. Stand. You will come with me. *he turns and starts walking.*
0,174,65,JACKSON,I think he wants us to follow him...can you walk?
0,174,65,VALA,"If it means getting away from here *nods, and with Jackson's help stands. Together, they follow to Prior...*"
0,174,65,PRIOR,Hallowed are the children of the Ori.
0,174,65,CROWD,"Hallowed are we. Hallowed are the Ori, *they all stand watching*"
0,174,65,ADMINISTRATOR,Hallowed are the Ori.
