0,177,0,"""THE POWERS THAT BE""",By Martin Gero
0,177,1,VALA,What are you doing here?
0,177,1,MITCHELL,Having lunch. *Eats*
0,177,1,VALA,Don't you care that there could be priors out there taking advantage of poor. Innocent. People. *he's reading some other file* Luring them into an Oppressive religion or worse...Killing them for rejecting it.
0,177,1,MITCHELL,Are you bored of bothering Jackson?
0,177,1,VALA,"Hey. You're supposed to be going out on missions through the Stargate. So let's go. Let's rid the galaxy of evil doers. *when he doesn't answer* Look despite what Daniel might think I really can help...*h obviously doesn't believe her* I know how things work out there. I'm physically capable, I'm good with weapons...Not to mention *louder* seductively attractive *two airman behind her turn to look, she laughs and waves* make a fine asset to any SG team."
0,177,1,MITCHELL,You left out selfish and untrustworthy. *eats*
0,177,1,VALA,"How about independent and *grins opening file, waves at it* resourceful."
0,177,1,MITCHELL,*quietly* that is a classified file. *definitely not happy*
0,177,1,VALA,*turns pages pointing* Priors have been reported on forty three different planets already.
0,177,1,MITCHELL,Yeah that's what the file says.
0,177,1,VALA,Well it just so happens that I have a very good relationship with the people on the one you've designated *reads*
0,177,1,MITCHELL,"*turns to her* Define... ""Relationship"""
0,177,1,VALA,"They trust me. *Mitchell nods, gets up.* what? Where are you going?"
0,177,1,MITCHELL,*heads for door* I'm going to go Talk to Landry
0,177,1,VALA,"Why? *makes a face, worried, makes fists with her hands*"
0,177,1,MITCHELL,*Comes back taking file* because anyone who trusts you...is obviously in a great deal of danger.
0,177,3,VALA,Oh good...no one's here.
0,177,3,MITCHELL,I thought these people trusted you...why are we sneaking around? Avoiding everybody?
0,177,3,VALA,"I already told you, they won't recognize me dressed like this. Fortunately I left a couple of spare outfits behind. *Heads for a side room*"
0,177,3,MITCHELL,What is it with her and her wardrobe?
0,177,3,JACKSON,*follows her* Look I think we could probably explain to them exactly
0,177,3,VALA,"*stops, turning to him* It'll only take a second. *stops him* can a Girl have a little privacy?"
0,177,3,JACKSON,No. Besides I think I've seen just about everything there is to see.
0,177,3,VALA,"*grins, Jackson really not liking the look she's giving him* right. *after a minute* Look there's no other way out of this room. I'm just going to change. Be right back. *she heads off*"
0,177,4,MITCHELL,Hey *waves*
0,177,5,AZDAK,These are the weapons of our God Qetesh! Who are you?
0,177,5,MITCHELL,Just take it easy
0,177,5,AZDAK,What are you doing here?
0,177,5,JACKSON,"*walks forward, hands raised* we mean no harm."
0,177,6,AZDAK,Please. Forgive us. It has been so long we began to fear you would not return.
0,177,7,VALA,Then you are foolish. I would not abandon you. I am your God.
0,177,8,CREDITS,
0,177,9,MALE1,I have pillaged the galaxy many times over. And made slaves of all the mortals I have encountered. This world pleases me and I shall take it as my own.
0,177,9,MALE2,"The benevolent god, Qetesh, will never allow such treachery."
0,177,9,JACKSON,*whispers to Mitchell* Not exactly Shakespeare
0,177,9,MALE1,----slave I am Ba'al---
0,177,9,MITCHELL,*whispers* How is it these people don't know the Goa'uld have fallen?
0,177,9,JACKSON,Most of these worlds are pretty isolated and I would be very surprised if anyone here actually knew how to operate the Gate.
0,177,9,TEAL'C,These humans must be told the truth.
0,177,9,JACKSON,I know. *looks at Vala*
0,177,9,MALE2,*a woman now stands by him* Oh merciful. Beautiful Qetesh. Have mercy on him...he knows not your power.
0,177,9,JACKSON,"*Walks up to Vala, whispers* What are you doing?"
0,177,9,VALA,It's a play. Don't worry...I think it will be over soon. Then we will eat.
0,177,9,JACKSON,That's not what I'm talking about.
0,177,9,VALA,"We want to stop these people from falling victim to the priors, that's what I'm going to do."
0,177,9,JACKSON,This is not what I had in mind.
0,177,9,VALA,"What your mind may or may not be able to imagine is really none of my concern. Now kindly get out of your God's face. *He gives her a look, she glances at him and he heads back to Mitchell and Teal'c*"
0,177,9,MALE2,---You have never met the likes of Qetesh
0,177,9,WOMAN,No man shall lay claim to my world. And no man shall bring harm to my children. Rises hand over Male1*
0,177,10,MALE2,Thanks be to you Qetesh. All hail and Glory be to you.
0,177,11,VALA,hmm...
0,177,11,AZDAK,"*stands* we had little rehearsal my lord, but I trust it pleases you?"
0,177,11,VALA,"Yes *Azdak grins* as always Azdak, you please your God greatly."
0,177,11,AZDAK,Thank you my lord. You have been greatly missed.
0,177,11,VALA,"*grins* Now. I would like to hear about the visitor who arrived through the Chappa'ai *After a lot of whispering* It is pointless lying to your God, Azdak, I am all knowing as well as all Beautiful *Mitchell and Jackson give her a look*"
0,177,11,AZDAK,He said that he was here to save us. That our true Gods await our devotion
0,177,11,VALA,Lies. *nods* meant to deceive you.
0,177,11,AZDAK,
0,177,11,VALA,"Some of you did,"
0,177,11,AZDAK,You have been absent for so many seasons. Some had thought you had abandoned us. They were weak my lord. Please...forgive them?
0,177,11,VALA,Have I not always been merciful to those who deserve forgiveness? *he nods* Now go while I consider your punishment.
0,177,11,AZDAK,Yes. Of course *bowing as he and the others leave*
0,177,11,VALA,*once they've all gone * Well that was easy. *stands stretching*
0,177,11,JACKSON,Shut that thing off.
0,177,11,VALA,mmm *hits a button*
0,177,11,TEAL'C,Why must you continue to deceive these people?
0,177,11,VALA,This was one of the many planets that Qetesh ruled over when I was her host. *more stretching* as you know a Tok'ra eventually removed the symbiote but not before her people rebelled and tortured me thinking we were one in the same.
0,177,11,MITCHELL,*stands* And they couldn't tell the difference? *mutters to Jackson and Teal'c* Why am I not surprised?
0,177,11,VALA,I had nothing. I was desolate. *sits by Jackson* Fortunately I discovered that news of Qetesh's demise had not reached this little mining outpost.
0,177,11,JACKSON,
0,177,11,VALA,"Just a tiny bit. *Jackson Can't believe it* Nothe mine was practically barren by the time I got here but this planet acted as a safe haven for me until I got back on my feet. *Teal'c groans, turning away* Look I never killed anyone; I never tortured them I was a wonderful God. Just ask them."
0,177,11,JACKSON,I think we will *gets up*
0,177,11,VALA,*Jumps up following* why? You don't believe me?
0,177,11,JACKSON,*stops turning to her* That. And I'm not totally convinced they're gonna follow your command nor should that be the only reason they don't follow the priors. *starts to head off again*
0,177,11,VALA,*follows* I am still supposed to be there God *he stops* I can't exactly go out there and ask them is they're going to listen to me.
0,177,11,JACKSON,I wasn't expecting you to. *starts off again*
0,177,11,VALA,*follows* what makes you think they're going to tell you the truth *he stops getting a little wound up* you're suppose to be my faithful servants.
0,177,11,JACKSON,"Then I'll just have to explain that we're not as faithful as you might like to believe and if necessary I'll also tell them we're plotting to. Kill. you. *he heads off, she stares shocked*"
0,177,11,VALA,hu-I *shouts after him* I have heard better plans. MITCHELL: *walks up to her* I kind of like it.
0,177,11,VALA,Shut up *storms off to throne.*
0,177,12,LANDRY,How are the staff Evaluations coming?
0,177,12,LAM,*pulls off stethoscope putting them in her pocket* They're done. They'll be on your desk by tomorrow morning. that's when they're due right?
0,177,12,LANDRY,yes. *nods* I have uhLunch with uh...the heads of my departments once a month...just to stay in touch...uh get any housekeeping done...it helps me get to know them a lot better...I know in our case uh...
0,177,12,LAM,*she stops* what? *waits* in our case what?
0,177,12,LANDRY,"well...it's just that we know each other better that I say do... Colonel Garret, the ammunitions supply officer."
0,177,12,LAM,really? I actually doubt that. Colonel Garrets been here longer than I have.
0,177,12,LANDRY,"*glances at a passing airman, quieter* do we have to do this here?"
0,177,12,LAM,You wanna have lunch? Fine. Tomorrow noon...I will be there as ordered.
0,177,12,LANDRY,It's not an order.
0,177,12,LAM,ok. *walks off*
0,177,14,THATCHNAR,"I have been sick for some time now, the past few harvests I've been more of a burden than a help to my family. I had even lost the ability to stand."
0,177,14,JACKSON,You're standing now.
0,177,14,THATCHNER,The prior. He cured me. *some of the villagers look over* Said that it was the will of the Ori.
0,177,14,AZDAK,*rushes for him* Blasphemer. *Teal'c and Mitchell stop him*
0,177,14,MITCHELL,Just take it easy...
0,177,14,AZDAK,I'm sorry...but I will not have him speak against Qetesh like that in my presence.
0,177,14,JACKSON,Look we're not out to get anybody here...we just want to hear what he has to say. *to Thatchner* go ahead.
0,177,14,THATCHNER,The Jewel in his staff glowed *a crowd gathers listening* He waved it over me and I felt better than I ever have. All he asked in return was that I tell others. That I spread the word of the Ori. Then upon his return...
0,177,14,TEAL'C,When is this prior to return?
0,177,14,THATCHNER,Tomorrow. The prior said that Qetesh is a false God. That if she ever returned he would expose her weakness.
0,177,14,AZDAK,You're a fool. Speak no more or I'll shall strike you don' in the name of our true God. *goes to hit him*
0,177,14,MITCELL,*stops him* I said take it easy.
0,177,14,AZDAK,You should be thankful that Qetesh is so forgiving. And pray that when she slays the prior for his wicked lies. She won't do the same to you.
0,177,14,JACKSON,Oh boy.
0,177,14,AZDAK,Glory be to Qetesh!! Glory to the one true God! G-
0,177,14,MITCHELL,Ok...you have made your point. Know when to stop.
0,177,14,JACKSON,I think I need to talk to our one true god. *Mitchell nods*
0,177,15,JACKSON,This is why you wanted to come back to this planet?
0,177,16,VALA,All of this is mine. I earnt it. These people have just been keeping it safe for me. *Jackson not happy* and as you said we can't be 100 percent certain that they're going to obey me so if this planet does fall to the priors...
0,177,16,MITCHELL,Hello. *picks up some gold* You stealing this planets most valued treasure is the least of our concerns right now. *drops gold*
0,177,16,VALA,"I like your attitude *grins at him* I was thinking of cutting you boys in at 10% but now I'm thinking *grabs his nose, pulling it* 20"
0,177,16,TEAL'C,Despite your return many of the villagers believe the Ori to be true gods and worthy of their loyalty.
0,177,16,VALA,all the more reason why we should pack all of this up right now and get out of here. Are you gonna pitch in or what?
0,177,16,TEAL'C,Others believe you will slay the prior in a show of power upon his return tomorrow.
0,177,16,VALA,Tomorrow hmm...tomorrows no good for me.
0,177,16,JACKSON,You need to tell these people the truth.
0,177,16,VALA,I have a lot of needs Daniel but I assure you that is not on of them.
0,177,16,TEAL'C,"If you do not tell them the truth, we will"
0,177,16,VALA,Yes...and who do you think they're actually going to believe?
0,177,16,JACKSON,Look commanding these people to obey you and not the Ori is not going to work. Especially once that prior comes back.
0,177,16,MITCHELL,And we do not want to get into a God-Off. Especially since we know you're not even close.
0,177,16,VALA,Forget what I said about the 20%
0,177,16,JACKSON,Yes he's right we can't just trade one lie for another lie.
0,177,16,VALA,*turns to him* Alright...what can we fight with then? How can we stop this prior from corrupting these people?
0,177,16,JACKSON,ok...we have a very limited window of opportunity here. If you expose yourself as a false God... *She paces* if you tell these people how you fooled them and why...we might be able to make them skeptical about the prior.
0,177,16,VALA,*comes back* or it could push them to believing in the Ori as rue gods even more.
0,177,16,JACKSON,No. The only chance these people havethe only chance any of us have against the priors is to show them we will not accept the Ori as Gods. No matter what happens we must reject them. True enlightenment must begin with the truth.
0,177,16,VALA,Oh please...the truth is so overrated.
0,177,16,JACKSON,Look *steps forward grabbing her shoulders* for once just do the right thing here...ok? You're gonna feel so good about it afterwards. Trust me. *smiles*
0,177,17,JACKSON,really this...this is unnecessary.
0,177,17,AZDAK,"You will be executed first light tomorrow. Imposter *spits at her feet, leaves*"
0,177,17,VALA,"So...Daniel *motions him over with her head, he steps closer* when does that warm and glowy feeling from doing the right thing kick in...cause...not there yet. *forced smile*"
0,177,18,VALA,I can't believe you all just stood there *gets up on bench pulling top bars* and let them imprison me.
0,177,18,JACKSON,Well what were we suppose to do?
0,177,18,VALA,You have guns don't you?
0,177,18,JACKSON,There's like over 100 people there
0,177,18,VALA,and? *jumps down walking over to other side*
0,177,18,JACKSON,Well...Just relax...we're gonna get you out of this
0,177,18,VALA,"*walks back over, calmly* Oh you are...? I feel a lot better... I'm sorry I...I...I got a little nervous what with the whole *shouts* Execution looming and all."
0,177,18,JACKSON,Would you just...believe me...it's not gonna come to that. Mitchell and Teal'c are talking to them right now.
0,177,18,VALA,*walks over* Have you forgotten that if I die...you die?
0,177,18,JACKSON,"Believe me it is not gonna come to that. Trust me. *Vala Gasps, turns her back to him and sits.* this time"
0,177,19,MITCHELL,Fine she made a mistake. it was a big mistake. It was a whopper...but you can't just kill her.
0,177,19,AZDAK,Why not?
0,177,19,MITCHELL,"*quiet, then* a little help?"
0,177,19,TEAL'C,Does she not deserve a trial? To explain the things that she has done?
0,177,19,AZDAK,I think we all have a pretty good idea of what she did and why. *walks past Mitchell*
0,177,19,MITCHELL,*grabs him* Your people are looking for leadership. They are looking to you. So you've got to decide. What kind of society do you want to have? One where people get executed without having a chance to explain their actions?
0,177,19,AZDAK,*realizing* you want to hold a maldarran?
0,177,19,MITCHELL,*to Teal'c* ain't that her name? *holds hand up to Azdak*
0,177,19,AZDAK,Qetesh established a process several years ago. A way to settle disputes between two parties.
0,177,19,MITCHELL,Fine. That sounds...fitting we're gonna hold a Maldarran.
0,177,20,JACKSON,*spots Mitchell* hey. How'd it go?
0,177,20,MITCHELL,"well you know...*Vala can't do it, gets up.*"
0,177,20,VALA,"what's the plan? You gonna blow up this door, lay down suppression fire, so that we can...rush out through the hidden escape passage. *Jackson looks at her* It's in the room I told you had no other exit *he bashes his hand on the door*"
0,177,20,MITCHELL,They're going to pt you on trial tomorrow.
0,177,20,VALA,*thinking* I like my plan better.
0,177,20,MITCHELL,Kinda is your plan. It's named after you.
0,177,20,VALA,really? *excited* a Maldarran. *grins* they going to let me be the judge?
0,177,20,MITCHELL,Don't think so.
0,177,20,VALA,Then it's not a real maldarran is it?
0,177,20,JACKSON,Actually this couldn't have worked out better.
0,177,20,VALA,Actually I think it could have
0,177,20,JACKSON,No a trial is public. We can use the form to expose what it is to be a false god and warn the community about the priors
0,177,20,VALA,You're right actually. We could get them all worked up about false God's and then they can kill me as an example to the others.
0,177,20,MICHELL,Look...I persuaded them to let you stay here for the night...
0,177,20,JACKSON,right...thanks...
0,177,20,MITCHELL,"Yeah...*heads off, waving* well I'll see you guys in the mooring."
0,177,20,VALA,*shouts after him* Thth-Thank you! I apologize for ever doubting your masterful skills at negotiations.
0,177,20,JACKSON,He's doing the best he can.
0,177,20,VALA,Oooh. That's what terrifies me
0,177,21,AZDAK,"*Get up, walks to the centre...* Welcome and thank you all for coming...unlike in the past...the final decisions of ...this Maldarran will be yours, my friends. A general vote. After both presentations have been made we shall all decide what is to be done to the false God Qetesh"
0,177,21,VALA,*a lot of muttering by the crowd* we're pleading innocent right?
0,177,21,JACKSON,*disbelieving* You already confessed.
0,177,21,VALA,a girl can change her mind.
0,177,21,AZDAK,"*a villager hands him a scroll, he opens it up* we shall begin as always...with a reading of the claims. The first claim of seven. Mass murder."
0,177,21,VALA,uhm-- *turns to Jackson* Wait a second
0,177,21,AZDAK,The second claim of seven. Mass Torture.
0,177,21,VALA,"*to Jackson, whose nodding* I never killed...I never Tortured... that is Qetesh."
0,177,21,AZDAK,The third claim of seven
0,177,21,JACKSON,*stands* uh...excuse me...Hi...sorry to interrupt. Um...the person seated before you didn't do those things...*Vala waves*
0,177,21,AZDAK,You will have your chance to make your presentation.
0,177,21,JACKSON,yes...um...I'm...I'm sure we will. I just wanted to make something very clear as we discussed when she confessed...Vala was a host...to a Goa'uld...a parasite that controlled her actions for many years. It was that Goa'uld symbiote named Qetesh that committed the atrocities that you are talking about...Vala herself can only be held responsible for the actions she did after that Goa'uld was removed...
0,177,21,AZDAK,When exactly was that?
0,177,21,JACKSON,"Um...*looks at Vala, leans down so she can whisper in his ear* four ye---four years? *quieter* four years."
0,177,21,AZDAK,"*goes to whisper with his co-council, comes back* very well. Assuming your assertion to be true. We shall begin again. *Vala grins at Jackson, who seems happy they've let her off* the first claim of four. Planetary wide forced labor. *Jackson's face falls, looks at Vala, who nods*"
0,177,21,MITCHELL,*to Teal'c*...this is gonna be a long day.
0,177,21,TEAL'C,Indeed.
0,177,21,AZDAK,"I...perhaps more than any of you, feel great sorrow...at the fact that I devoted my love...and faith so freely to *turns to point at Vala*...an imposter, Who cared only for the naquadah in our mines. With every breath... she lied. With every effort... she stole. At every chance she betrayed us. The conditions of poverty that we now suffer... are her fault and her fault alone. That is what you must consider! *the crowd starts whispering*"
0,177,21,MITCHELL,*to Vala* he's good.
0,177,21,VALA,I'm dead.
0,177,21,JACKSON,*takes a deep breath stands*...yes. She stole. She betrayed you. She used you as slave labor. All this is true.
0,177,21,VALA,*Confused* not the opening statement I would have gone for.
0,177,21,MITCHELL,shhh
0,177,21,JACKSON,"but the only reason you know about this is because she told you. She came forward knowing full well how you would feel...what the consequences would be...ask yourselves...why would she do this? She did it because there is a greater threat in this galaxy she thought you deserved to know about. She told the truth in order to open your eyes...to show you the dangers of giving away your freedom, your freewill...in the hopes...that given another chance you wouldn't make that same mistake twice. *Vala holds her head higher* we know that a prior of the Ori has come here, he's been sent to this village to convince you to worship beings more powerful than all of us, but you must know...that like Vala they are not gods."
0,177,21,PRIOR,You speak well Daniel Jackson *Teal'c stands raising P-90* of the planet Earth. What is a god? What power is great enough to make you bow down in humble reverence *Jackson look at Vala*
0,177,21,VALA,*whispers to Mitchell* that's the one that tried to burn us to death. twice
0,177,21,PRIOR,There is only one measure. The only question you may ask yourself is why must I believe? What is there for any or all to gain by choosing the path of origin? Those seeking eternal salvation can follow the word of the Ori. Those that do not shall die as mortals. It is as simple as that. The day of reckoning approaches. *grins* your destiny awaits.
0,177,21,MITCHELL,He's pretty good too...
0,177,21,VALA,We are so dead.
0,177,22,THATCHNER,"*steps forward, dropping to his knees*I have told them of the Ori Prior. Many of us believe."
0,177,22,JACKSON,But not all of us.
0,177,22,PRIOR,You doubt the power of the Ori?
0,177,22,JACKSON,No. but I understand how they got it...and because I do I'm not willing to abandon my own freewill and worship them for it.
0,177,22,PRIOR,The Ori healed this man. This man that was sick. This man that could barely walk.
0,177,22,JACKSON,This man was healed through Knowledge. We have medicine. We have...tools that can do much the same thing. This device *picks up healing device from other table* has the power to heal...if you know how to use it. But not by power *holds it up* it's called technology.
0,177,22,PRIOR,Technology.
0,177,22,JACKSON,yes. Knowledge. Understanding. Of the way things work. Of the science... of the universe.
0,177,22,PRIOR,Maybe so...but consider this. There are two men. One is starving and the other has a plentiful crop. Is it not wrong...for the fortunate man to hoard his harvest? *the crowd whispers* should he not share with his hungry brother? It is the same with knowledge and understanding...as you have said the Ori have a greater understanding of the universe but most importantly they are willing to share it with us. Out of their love for us...their creation...only a fool would turn away.
0,177,22,JACKSON,"Just because the Ori know more than we do, doesn't make them gods...they are beings who were once like you and me...but they evolved...they learned of humanities potential...eventually over time they used that knowledge to shed their physical bodies and live as energy on another *raises hand* higher plane of existence."
0,177,22,VALA,*mutters to Mitchell* which side is he on?
0,177,22,PRIOR,you are all children of the Ori! But you've been raised by evil...the true nature of the universe has been kept from you by powers that would have you stray from the path of origin...it is time to open your eyes...let origin show you the way.
0,177,22,JACKSON,no...you're right...*walks* maybe hoarding the knowledge is wrong. Or maybe its not...maybe learning for yourself is part of the journey to enlightenment. But killing someone for not worshipping you...regardless of your power. Is wrong. Very wrong. Knowledge is power...but how you use that power defines whether you are good...or evil.
0,177,22,PRIOR,The choice is yours.
0,177,22,THATCHNER,Give us another chance I beg you. Please...spare us all
0,177,22,PRIOR,*puts hands on Thatchners head* Believe in the power of the ori...or be laid down in the dust *smirks at Vala*
0,177,23,AZDAK,Escort the prisoner back to the cell...
0,177,23,JACKSON,wait...
0,177,23,AZDAK,we're done with the Maldarran...we must vote now on her punishment and...discuss other issues...we now face...
0,177,23,JACKSON,waAzdak...I know what the Ori seem to be offering you might sound very tempting...
0,177,23,AZDAK,"We are poverty stricken, as a society we may not be able to survive much longer...we thought our god *waves at Vala* would provide for us. Why should we reject the knowledge and education to better ourselves...?"
0,177,23,JACKSON,But you can have all that without giving up your freedom. Don't you see how wrong it is to enforce belief by threatening your people with their very lives?
0,177,23,AZDAK,As the Ori said...would we not be ignorant and deserving of punishment for failing to see the plain truth before us? *looks at Vala shaking head* Leave us...we shall deliberate.
0,177,24,LANDRY,Comfortable where you're living?
0,177,24,LAM,I kind of like the place I'm renting in Cimarron hills
0,177,24,LANDRY,that's nice... you ought to buy.
0,177,24,LAM,well...just wait and see...I don't know how long I'm going to be here...so
0,177,24,LANDRY,"*nods, shifts* how's your mother?"
0,177,24,LAM,why don't you call her and find out yourself? *eats*
0,177,24,LANDRY,why does everything have to be so hostile? I'm trying. To tell you the truth I don't really know where to start...
0,177,24,LAM,start what? The long road back to happily ever after?
0,177,24,LANDRY,I had a job to do.
0,177,24,LAM,as I do. Now I though this was suppose to be a professional meeting about my staff? That's why I'm here.
0,177,24,LANDRY,excuse me. *gets up leaves*
0,177,26,VALA,You need to work on your anti-Ori speech...that prior almost had me believing...well not so much believing as willing to say I believe...
0,177,26,JACKSON,I know...
0,177,26,VALA,you are asking people to stand up and put their lives on the line...
0,177,26,JACKSON,I really believe it's the only way we're gonna have to defend ourselves against them...
0,177,26,VALA,we could try shooting them...*he grins* you said the priors are human...right? A few well aimed shots might...at least get there attention.
0,177,26,JACKSON,well...you study enough religions you find that killing the missionaries doesn't combat the overall philosophy.
0,177,26,VALA,The problem is that what the priors are offering sounds quite good...until you get to the whole prostrating and burning people alive bits...
0,177,26,JACKSON,There's that...and I don't think any of us have read the real fine print yet.
0,177,26,VALA,Meaning?
0,177,26,JACKSON,"Well...I personally know without a doubt, the priors are bad..."
0,177,26,VALA,So creepy...
0,177,26,JACKSON,And...believe or die is an archaic moral standing... No the Ori are wrong for doing what they're doing but the part I haven't figured out yet...the part that's really bothering me is...why they're doing it? I mean what do they care if people worship them or not?
0,177,27,AZDAK,We have decided to spare your life...*Both Vala and Jackson sigh in relief*
0,177,27,VALA,Really? Thank you.
0,177,27,AZDAK,Your punishment...will be imprisonment for the rest of your life...
0,177,27,VALA,What? Azdak...after everything we've been through *waves between them*...together
0,177,27,AZDAK,you made me rub your feet
0,177,28,VALA,Weren't you justly rewarded? Anyway the odd massage here and there hardly warrants life imprisonment...
0,177,28,AZDAK,You lied and abused the people of this planet.
0,177,28,JACKSON,What about the prior?
0,177,28,VALA,Wait a minute...we're not done with me yet. *hits Jackson again* AZDAK: Yes we are. As for the Prior the settlement is divided. Many believe the Ori are worthy of our devotion.
0,177,28,JACKSON,and you?
0,177,29,MAN,Thatchner has fallen ill.
0,177,29,JACKSON,that's the man the prior healed...
0,177,29,AZDAK,yes
0,177,29,MAN,Please hurry....we fear he may be close to death
0,177,29,JACKSON,*Azdak moves to go* wait Azdak......um...maybe we can help.
0,177,30,THATCHNER,I do not want you near me.
0,177,30,VALA,Take it easy.
0,177,30,JACKSON,Its ok....she's not gonna hurt him.
0,177,31,VALA,there. *she stops it* how do you feel now?
0,177,31,THATCHNER,What have you done to me?
0,177,31,VALA,Hmm...*grins* making people feel good is a natural talent of mine
0,177,31,JACKSON,*bends down helping Thatchner* can you sit up?
0,177,31,THATCHNER,I do not understand. How did she do it?
0,177,31,JACKSON,*takes healing device* well...this is a tool. Like a hammer or a shovel just a lot more complicated. Just because you don't understand something at first does not mean it's the magic of the gods.
0,177,32,AZDAK,You think...that if we are united and tell this prior that we will not heed his word he will merely go away and leave us alone?
0,177,32,JACKSON,"Well I wish I could say for sure what would happen, all I know is you have to make a stand."
0,177,32,MITCHELL,Whatever happens we'll be here to back you up.
0,177,32,JACKSON,But ultimately it's gonna be up to you and your people.
0,177,32,AZDAK,*stops turns to Vala* in exchange for saving Thatchners life I have decided to reopen the issue of your life imprisonment...
0,177,32,VALA,Thank you. I have to admit it did make me feel rather good.
0,177,32,JACKSON,I'm sure you thought there might be a reward...
0,177,32,VALA,That's not what I did it *Jackson gives her a disbelieving nod*
0,177,32,AZDAK,Speaking of rewards...the entirety of your property will be kept here as payment for your crimes.
0,177,32,VALA,"Now hang on a minute...*Azdak almost faints they grab him, pulling him upright*"
0,177,32,JACKSON,You alright?
0,177,32,AZDAK,yeah yes... its just been a long day.
0,177,32,MAN,*runs up to them* Azdak! You must come quickly
0,177,32,AZDAK,What is it?
0,177,32,MAN,Many have fallen ill.
0,177,34,AZDAK,*sits up* Thank you...you are truly blessed...
0,177,34,VALA,Oh I don't know about that...I'm just doing the best that I can...
0,177,34,AZDAK,How many have fallen ill?
0,177,34,VALA,I've lost count...but it's a lot
0,177,35,JACKSON,Well whatever this thing is it's spreading like wild fire... come on we need you over here...*leaves*
0,177,35,VALA,We'll talk about my treasure later *Follows Jackson*
0,177,36,MITCHELL,"We're doing our best to quarantine the sick, Vala's using the healing device...to cure them as they come in...but they're piling up pretty quick..."
0,177,36,LAM,Symptoms?
0,177,36,MITCHELL,"Weakness, high fever...chest and stomach pains...um...they have trouble breathing...some of the extreme cases have gone into shock before Vala can even get to them"
0,177,37,MITCHELL,Oh...I'd...I'd say we know the source...
0,177,37,LANDRY,Looks like these priors want to show us they're gonna play hardball
0,177,37,MITCHELL,Well they're definitely trying to establish some credibility sir.
0,177,37,LAM,how are you and you're team colonel.
0,177,37,MITCHELL,yeah we're fine...but I reckon we could use some back up
0,177,37,LANDRY,On the way colonel.
0,177,37,MITCHELL,Thank you sir.
0,177,38,JACKSON,You alright? *Sits next to her*
0,177,38,VALA,no.
0,177,38,JACKSON,you can do this
0,177,38,VALA,I'm not so sure.
0,177,38,JACKSON,Look I know using that hand device must be taking a lot out of you but we really...really need your help right now
0,177,38,VALA,Each one is getting harder...Each time it takes longer and they keep coming I don't think I can save this whole village Daniel
0,177,38,JACKSON,You have to keep trying...
0,177,38,MITCHELL,Jackson we have a problem here...
0,177,38,JACKSON,*grabs radio* Give me a minute
0,177,38,MITCHELL,Now please...
0,177,40,JACKSON,He was just fine.
0,177,40,MITCHELL,Well he's not fine now.
0,177,40,VALA,*drops down beside Azdak* I healed him...*looks at Jackson* if they can get re-infected this will never end...
0,177,40,AZDAK,We must give in...they are too powerful
0,177,40,VALA,No...*she uses the healing device on him* its ok...I'm here.
0,177,41,LANDRY,Caroline
0,177,41,LAM,I'm chief medical officer on this base. Its my call who goes on this mission. Given my work with the CDC infectious disease is my specialty. *stops* I am easily the most qualified for this.
0,177,41,LANDRY,I know. I'm your dad. Just came by to wish you luck and be careful
0,177,41,LAM,thank you. I will. *heads off*
0,177,42,JACKSON,"Hang in there. Don't give up yet. *looks over at Vala, who is healing a woman, shaking her head*"
0,177,42,MITCHELL,"Hey...*spotting Lam, walks over, he looks a little hot...* thanks for coming..."
0,177,42,LAM,This is worse than I thought
0,177,42,MITCHELL,Yeah...they're falling pretty fast
0,177,42,LAM,we're gonna need a place to work.
0,177,42,MITCHELL,"*nods, points* this way."
0,177,43,JACKSON,*quietly* what?
0,177,43,VALA,this *holds up healing device* is not working anymore...*hands it to him* I'm sorry
0,177,43,JACKSON,*sighs* you have to keep trying...I mean...at least put on a show keep their hopes up...we know you can do that
0,177,43,VALA,"see this is exactly why I don't even think about trying to help people. *jumps* I'm terrible at it, because of me...these poor souls are either gonna die horribly or they're gonna give into the prior in the hopes that he'll heal them"
0,177,43,JACKSON,*snaps quietly* that's not because of you!
0,177,43,VALA,I cannot make them better! And if I hadn't have been so worried about my precious treasure I would never have opened my big fat mouth and we never would have come here.
0,177,43,JACKSON,Then these people would still have to either convert to origin or face the consequences. And that's a dilemma the rest of our galaxy is going to have to worry about.
0,177,43,LAM,*Walks over to them * May I speak with you?
0,177,44,LAM,"I've pretty much ruled out bacterial infection at this point I'm treating with an antiviral cocktail, we're just gonna have to wait and see"
0,177,44,JACKSON,any idea why the hand device seems to have lost its effectiveness?
0,177,44,LAM,*they stop* First I'd have to understand even remotely how that thing works. I do know its not unheard of for viruses to mutate and become immune to whatever's trying to attack it
0,177,44,JACKSON,alright...I don't know if this helps or not but we know the ancients were almost wiped out by a similar plague *Lam nods* I'm just bringing it up in case there's something in the research that's already been done.
0,177,44,VALA,You think the Ori gave it to them? *he shrugs*
0,177,44,LAM,I am aware that sg-1 was infected with a virus and then cured by an ancient found frozen down in Antarctica. Now...the symptoms and rate of progression here...are remarkably similar.
0,177,44,TEAL'C,Do you have any hypotheses as to why we have not been affected?
0,177,44,LAM,No...we're still looking at your blood work...excuse me *she leaves Teal'c follows*
0,177,44,VALA,*to Jackson * feel my forehead am I hot? Hotter than usual *takes his hand* well *puts it on her head* you know what I mean...
0,177,45,LAM,I'm sorry...I'm sure you know how much I wanted to walk in here and solve this.
0,177,45,LANDRY,Hey you wanted to be a doctor
0,177,45,LAM,I've seen some bad situations before but nothing like this...
0,177,45,LANDRY,And based on that comparison what's that prognosis?
0,177,45,LAM,If we don't make a big breakthrough really soon...these people are going to need a miracle
0,177,45,NURSE,Dr Lam. You're need immediately
0,177,45,LAM,I have to go. Lam out.
0,177,46,VALA,This is bad right
0,177,46,LAM,The virus is shutting down his internal organs. He can't process toxins within his own system...he's essentially being poisoned to death.
0,177,46,VALA,Can't you give him more medicine
0,177,46,LAM,As it is this may be the virus bouncing back against treatment... I hate having to say this...but there's nothing I can do.
0,177,48,LAM,"Time of death. 14 hours 18 minutes after preliminary symptoms were first noted. *Its Azdak, they cover his head* remove the body and prep him for autopsy. *heads off*"
0,177,48,VALA,*stops nurse* can I have a minute with him first?
0,177,49,JACKSON,This is the first. not the last. I've got to get back to Colonel Mitchell.
0,177,50,JACKSON,You did everything you could.
0,177,50,THATCHNER,
0,177,50,VALA,You go ahead Daniel. *he heads off*
0,177,51,THATCHNER,Please you must save us. Forgive those blinded by ignorance. People are dieing. Our children are dieing. They will believe. They do believe.
0,177,51,PRIOR,Still...not all of you. *looks beyond him*
0,177,51,THATCHNER,*Jackson and Teal'c walk over* they are not of us. They do not speak for us.
0,177,51,JACKSON,Why are you doing this?
0,177,51,PRIOR,From the smallest seeds of doubt springs forth a mighty poisonous tree of evil.
0,177,51,JACKSON,Yeah alright. Cut the crap. This is my fault alright. I'm the one who told these people that if they didn't bow down to you... bow down to the ori. You might just give up and go away. Well I was wrong. I understand now. You don't have to kill them to prove a point to me.
0,177,51,PRIOR,Do you truly understand?
0,177,51,JACKSON,I understand this isn't about you and me.
0,177,51,PRIOR,it is about all the children of the Ori.
0,177,51,VALA,"Enough. *she walks up next to Jackson, holding P-90* heal these people now."
0,177,51,JACKSON,Vala...
0,177,51,VALA,No Daniel I've had it with the Ori I think its time we sent them a message. Or will you heal them
0,177,51,PRIOR,Only their faith can heal them now.
0,177,51,VALA,"Then you are useless to us *pulls p-90 up firing at prior, the bullets stop just short of his body and drop to the ground*"
0,177,51,THATCHNER,Stop at once. Please do not let their evil deeds doom us. *he kneels* we all bow to the power of the Ori. *the other follow and Bow too*
0,177,51,PRIOR,Hallowed are the Ori
0,177,51,CROWD,Hallowed are the Ori
0,177,52,LAM,Colonel.
0,177,52,MITCHELL,Ugh...wow. Have you got a couple of aspirin?
0,177,52,MALE NURSE,*runs in* Dr Lam!
0,177,52,LAM,*waves him off* how are you feeling.
0,177,52,MITCHELL,Tingly...how about we pretend I didn't say that
0,177,52,LAM,Ok...you hang on...and I'll be right back. *She and male nurse run off*
0,177,52,MITCHELL,Hey what did I miss?
0,177,53,LAM,Oh my god.
0,177,53,MALE NURSE,That's not all. *points*
0,177,55,PRIOR,"Tell others what you have seen today. *he leaves, the crowd bowing to him*"
