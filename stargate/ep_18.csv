0,18,0,"""THERE BUT FOR THE GRACE OF GOD""","By Robert C. Cooper The team arrive offworld, into a large dark room"
0,18,0,JACK,"Good morning, Campers!"
0,18,0,TEAL'C,There is damage here. It appears to be done by Goa'uld weaponry. I do not believe this battle took place recently.
0,18,0,DANIEL,No bodies.
0,18,0,SAM,"Daniel, you recognize any of these symbols?"
0,18,0,DANIEL,No. This place is definitely Alien.
0,18,0,JACK,"Take Carter and check it out. Whoa...Teal'c, you ever seen anything like this before?"
0,18,0,TEAL'C,We must return to Earth as quickly as possible.
0,18,0,JACK,Why? What is it?
0,18,0,TEAL'C,"It is the symbol of Korosh'ni, it is for any Goa'uld or Jaffa who may pass through the gate. Loosely translated it means, turn back"
0,18,0,JACK,Does it elaborate?
0,18,0,TEAL'C,"It is placed on world that Goa'uld destroyers have wiped out and contaminated. This planets entire surface will be in your terms, radioactive."
0,18,0,JACK,Oh
0,18,0,TEAL'C,No one will be left alive. This place is not safe.
0,18,1,DANIEL,I think this is a lab.
0,18,1,SAM,How do you know?
0,18,1,DANIEL,"These are things they brought back from the Stargate to study, there all tagged! This is a Turkish mask. This is a clay cone from Langash with cuneiform symbols on it."
0,18,1,JACK,"Carter, Daniel."
0,18,1,SAM,We found a souvenir shop sir.
0,18,1,JACK,We're out of here.
0,18,1,DANIEL,"What? Why? This place is a treasure chest of artifacts, of diverse human cultures."
0,18,1,JACK,"I don't want to hear about it. Let's go. Jack turns around and leaves, along with Teal'c and Carter stars to follow."
0,18,1,DANIEL,You don't want to hear it.
0,18,2,JACK,"Daniel! Were leaving, let's go!"
0,18,3,DANIEL,"Guys, I need a hand with this thing, it's too heavy but we have to take it back."
0,18,4,DANIEL,Jack? Sam? Oh I really hate it when this happens.
0,18,5,TEHAMMOND,Close the Iris!
0,18,6,AIRMAN,Hands on your head. Now. Or we will open fire.
0,18,6,DANIEL,What's going on?
0,18,6,AIRMAN,Identify your self.
0,18,6,DANIEL,"Daniel Jackson, SG-1"
0,18,7,HAMMOND,General? You stars anywhere on my uniform?
0,18,7,AIRMAN,"Colonel, he says he's on SG-1."
0,18,7,DANIEL,Colonel?
0,18,7,HAMMOND,How did you get an SG-1 remote activation device?
0,18,8,DANIEL,What are you talking about?
0,18,9,HAMMOND,Who the hell are you?
0,18,10,DANIEL,I am Dr. Daniel Jackson! I'm SG-1! I need to see Jack O'Neill!
0,18,11,DANIEL,"Ask Sam Carter! Come on! The throw Danny on a stretcher. I am not a Goa'uld! Don't give me that! Where is Dr. Fraser? Don't give me that! I am Dr. Daniel Jackson, I need to see Colonel O'Neill."
0,18,12,AIRMAN,"You mean, General O'Neill?"
0,18,13,DANIEL,Hello? I have to speak to someone!
0,18,14,DANIEL,Catherine?
0,18,14,CATHERINE,You know me?
0,18,14,DANIEL,Of course...You don't know me?
0,18,14,CATHERINE,"Dr. Daniel Jackson, linguist. Ancient Egyptian Historian. Better know for some of the more radical ideas. At the moment I am more interested in how you came through my Stargate."
0,18,14,DANIEL,"Your Stargate. What the Hell is going on here, Catherine?"
0,18,14,CATHERINE,"I would address me as Dr. Langford. You were wearing a remote device when you came through the gate. You had SG-1's code, how did you obtain it?"
0,18,14,DANIEL,"How did I, how do you think I did it? I left from here, Stargate Command, today, a few hours ago. I went through on a mission to P3R-233."
0,18,14,CATHERINE,What are you talking about? You have never been into this facility until now.
0,18,14,DANIEL,"I figured out how to work the Stargate. You recruited me to translate the cartouche found in Giza. I went through on the first mission, through the Stargate, to Abydos. And unless the last two years have been some, wacky, wacky dream, I am a member of SG-1."
0,18,14,CATHERINE,Not as far as Im concerned!
0,18,14,DANIEL,What?
0,18,14,CATHERINE,I supervised the team that translated the Cartouche found at Giza.
0,18,14,DANIEL,You did!
0,18,14,CATHERINE,I admit we referenced your work occasionally. I even went to meet you at one of your seminars to ask you to join us. But you said no.
0,18,14,DANIEL,I did!
0,18,14,CATHERINE,You were quite rude actually.
0,18,14,DANIEL,Oh I was.
0,18,14,CATHERINE,The M.R.I. confirms you're not a Goa'uld.
0,18,14,DANIEL,Can I see Captain Carter?
0,18,14,CATHERINE,Samantha Carter?
0,18,14,DANIEL,Yes!
0,18,14,CATHERINE,"She is not in the Military. She's a Doctor. PH.D. Astrophysics, she's attending to more important business right at the moment. Don't you have any explanation for this?"
0,18,14,DANIEL,"God No! Catherine, I mean Dr. Langford, no, this doesnt make any sense! I know you! I belong here! You don't!"
0,18,14,CATHERINE,Excuse me?
0,18,14,DANIEL,"You were retired. At least the Air Force made you retire! You are supposed to be at home, living happily ever after with Earnest."
0,18,14,CATHERINE,What?
0,18,14,DANIEL,The man you were supposed to marry in
0,18,15,HAMMOND,"We've only got 50 % of the list through the Beta site, General. Voyager is still on route. J"
0,18,15,CATHERINE,"I'm sorry, I know you're a little bit busy right now."
0,18,15,JACK,"It's alright, Catherine, what is it?"
0,18,15,CATHERINE,"I think you should meet the young man that came through the gate, Jack."
0,18,15,JACK,Now.
0,18,15,CATHERINE,How much time do we have?
0,18,15,JACK,Why?
0,18,15,CATHERINE,He knows things.
0,18,16,DANIEL,Jack.
0,18,16,JACK,"Look we're in the middle of a situation right now. I don't know who you are, but Dr. Langford says you might be able to help us?"
0,18,16,DANIEL,"Okay this is starting to get a little bit spooky. Now a few hours ago, everything about this place was different. I mean no, not completely different, you're still you. Sort of."
0,18,16,JACK,What can you tell me about the Goa'uld?
0,18,16,DANIEL,What?
0,18,16,JACK,The Goa'uld? You know who they are?
0,18,16,DANIEL,Oh yeah.
0,18,16,JACK,Tell me what you know.
0,18,16,DANIEL,"Okay, now maybe I have completely lost my mind here but as far as I am concerned we know each other, very well. You know everything that I know! Look, I am a member of SG-1, with you Captain Carter and Teal'c! Where is Teal'c? Big guy, gold emblem on his head, Goa'uld in his stomach, you can't miss him!"
0,18,16,JACK,A Jaffa?
0,18,16,DANIEL,Yes! He's our friend.
0,18,16,JACK,Get this man out of here now!
0,18,16,CATHERINE,How did he come through the gate? How does he know the things he knows?
0,18,16,DANIEL,"According to Dr. Langford, you still went thought the gate without me. Did you still go to Abydos with the intention of blowing up a nuclear device?"
0,18,16,JACK,How did you know that?
0,18,16,DANIEL,"You were willing to commit suicide, because your son had recently died! He shot himself with your gun, right?"
0,18,16,CATHERINE,I swear I didn't tell him anything.
0,18,16,DANIEL,So did you still go to Chu'lak?
0,18,16,CATHERINE,What is Chu'lak?
0,18,16,DANIEL,The Jaffa home world.
0,18,16,CATHERINE,You know the symbols?
0,18,16,DANIEL,Yes! What you want me to write it down?
0,18,16,CATHERINE,Yes!
0,18,16,DANIEL,"So if you never been to Chu'lak, you probably never even met Teal'c."
0,18,16,JACK,Teal?
0,18,16,DANIEL,No! Teal'c!
0,18,17,SAM,Who is this?
0,18,17,CATHERINE,Dr. Jackson.
0,18,17,DANIEL,Of course.
0,18,17,CATHERINE,The young man who came through the Stargate with SG-1's remote code.
0,18,17,JACK,"Report, Doctor?"
0,18,17,SAM,"We've lost Washington and Philly, sir."
0,18,17,DANIEL,"I'm sorry, what do you mean by lost? Everyone looks confused."
0,18,17,JACK,Show him.
0,18,18,TECH,We're locking in co-ordinates.
0,18,18,CATHERINE,"Everyone of those red dots, is a destroyed city."
0,18,18,TECH,"Dr. Carter, theres another report coming on."
0,18,18,TV REPORTER,All Military efforts to engage in the Alien ships have proven inconsequential.
0,18,18,DANIEL,The Goa'uld?
0,18,18,SAM,The ships appeared four days ago.
0,18,18,TV REPORTER,"As in Asia, Europe and Africa, they have moved slowly, systematically annihilating all signs of civilization. Starting on the East coast, and moving west with frightening inevitability. There has been no response with attempted communication with the Aliens. Thus far, they have left no survivors in the wake of the seemingly unstoppable wave of destruction."
0,18,19,DANIEL,"I feel like the victim of the biggest practical joke, ever!"
0,18,19,CATHERINE,You found this on the Alien planet you were talking about?
0,18,19,DANIEL,"With the exception of the gun and the grenade. I found this lab, they obviously collected things that they found on different planets. There was this mirror like a slab of rock, it could of been made of Naquada, the gate element, I don't know. Jack called, he said we're leaving, I touched the mirror."
0,18,19,CATHERINE,Interesting. What is it?
0,18,19,DANIEL,I have no idea.
0,18,19,CATHERINE,You said you touched a mirror.
0,18,19,DANIEL,"Well actually I touched that thing first. It turned on, I heard a noise, thats when I noticed the shimmering."
0,18,19,CATHERINE,Maybe this is what controls it.
0,18,19,DANIEL,"When I touched the mirror, there was this surge, it was like getting an electrical shock, just for a second. And then I went to find Jack, Sam and Teal'c."
0,18,19,CATHERINE,He's the Jaffa you say is on SG-1 with you.
0,18,19,DANIEL,"Yes. But I couldnt find them, it was like they were just gone. So I figured that maybe they left without me, so I dial up Earths address, I came through, and I...."
0,18,20,DANIEL,What the hell are they doing down there?
0,18,21,TECH,Yes sir! He hangs up phone.
0,18,22,SAM,"Sir, isn't our mission to get the Genesis list through to the Beta sight?"
0,18,22,JACK,I think we will try to stop the attack on Earth first.
0,18,22,DANIEL,"What is this Genesis list, Beta site. What does she mean?"
0,18,23,CATHERINE,"Were evacuating everyone we can to another planet. World leaders, scientist, Doctors."
0,18,24,TECH,Let's commence the symmetric enlargement 85 percent.
0,18,24,DANIEL,You're sending a nuclear weapon to Chu'lak?
0,18,24,JACK,You got a problem with that?
0,18,24,DANIEL,"The Jaffa arent your enemy, they're just slaves!"
0,18,24,JACK,"Alright try to comprehend what's going on here, we estimate the death toll on Earth is 1.5 Billion."
0,18,25,JACK,"Who do you think is flying those ships, trying to blow up our world? Hmm? You give me one good reason why I shouldn't be striking back."
0,18,26,DANIEL,They have no choice.
0,18,26,JACK,Send the bomb.
0,18,26,HARRIMAN,Proceed with deployment! We watch the bomb go into the gate. The iris is closed. Iris locked!
0,18,26,JACK,Proceed with evaluation until the next war head is ready.
0,18,26,DANIEL,You know there are innocent human beings on most of the Goa'uld planets don't you?
0,18,26,JACK,"Unless this man has more information we can use, I don't want to see him again."
0,18,27,DANIEL,"This isn't happening, this is nuts! This isn't happening. This isn't happening. Is it possible that. the Stargate malfunctioned, or went haywire, and I came through to a totally, screw up, different version of Earth?"
0,18,27,SAM,"No, I doubt that, the Stargate uses space time to create a wormhole that allows us to travel across great distances. It doesnt take you to an alternate reality."
0,18,27,DANIEL,Alternate reality?
0,18,27,SAM,"Well basically, scientist have theorized that, there are an infinite number of dominations, each containing a different possibility of reality."
0,18,27,DANIEL,"Well it sounds like I theoretically, possibly, actually, found one!"
0,18,27,CATHERINE,One what?
0,18,27,DANIEL,"What Sam said! Alternate reality! A parallell plane, I mean wouldn't that explain why everything here is the same but different! I mean..."
0,18,27,SAM,"Okay the theory is, that there a infinite number of alternate realities. Some are very different, and some are almost identical."
0,18,27,DANIEL,That has to be what this is! So this isn't my world at all this is some other dimension?
0,18,27,SAM,"Yeah, but the Stargate wouldnt cause that!"
0,18,27,CATHERINE,Maybe it wasnt the Stargate that caused it.
0,18,27,SAM,What are you suggesting?
0,18,27,CATHERINE,"He found a mirror, possibly made of naquada, on P3R-233."
0,18,27,DANIEL,"All this started to happen, after I touched it!"
0,18,27,P3R-233?,
0,18,27,DANIEL,"What, have you been there?"
0,18,27,SAM,Yes!
0,18,27,HARRIMAN,Off world activation!
0,18,27,SAM,Close the Blast doors and keep the iris sealed!
0,18,27,TECH,Receiving coded transmissions from Air Force One!
0,18,27,SAM,"Notify General O'Neill! Catherine, the rest of the Genesis travelers will have to be briefed and ready to go."
0,18,27,CATHERINE,Right.
0,18,28,DANIEL,"Current address unknown, phone number unknown, last place of residence, Egypt as of 1997."
0,18,28,SAM,What?
0,18,28,DANIEL,I think I'm dead.
0,18,28,SAM,What?
0,18,28,DANIEL,"The me, in this reality."
0,18,28,HAMMOND,"What is Voyagers status, Doctor?"
0,18,28,SAM,The president's airplane is ten minutes away from Peterson AirForce base.
0,18,28,TECH,Another coded transmission in progress!
0,18,28,SAM,Relay it through the decoder and patch it through the speaker.
0,18,29,HARRIMAN,Surface radar is tracking!
0,18,30,JACK,That's one of there big ones.
0,18,30,SAM,Look how fast it's moving!
0,18,31,SAM,It's headed straight for us.
0,18,31,JACK,Confirm Airman!
0,18,31,HARRIMAN,Trajectory confirmed. E.T.A. One minute!
0,18,31,JACK,Damn it! Evacuation gave us away.
0,18,31,SAM,Intelligence has confirmed that the enemy ships have the fire power to reach us even this far under ground.
0,18,31,HAMMOND,We're stuck here as long as the gates under attack.
0,18,31,HARRIMAN,"The ship is slowing down, visual tracking in 10 seconds."
0,18,31,SAM,"If they fire on us, chances are we wont even feel it! Blast on the East coast were the equivalent of a two hundred ton nuclear war head."
0,18,31,DANIEL,It's not going to fire.
0,18,31,SAM,What?
0,18,31,DANIEL,It's landing.
0,18,32,HAMMOND,"Looks like there coming in the front door, sir."
0,18,32,JACK,"Alright, position automatic weapons, here and here. Men in all these halls. Cut off every access to this level. Blow secondary elevator shaft now."
0,18,32,HAMMOND,If the men at the surface have to fall back.
0,18,32,JACK,"There's only going to be one way down.I want all none essential personnel, through the gate, to the Beta site, ASAP. Dr. Langford, that includes you, and our guest."
0,18,32,SAM,Sir the Goa'uld have been keeping the wormhole established from off world.
0,18,32,DANIEL,That's probably because you sent that bomb through to Chu'lak.
0,18,32,SAM,"The point is, unless we get another window of opportunity, to open the gate from here, we're all stuck."
0,18,32,JACK,Recommendations?
0,18,32,SAM,"Well under normal circumstances, when we have full power, we can only keep a worm hole established about a half hour. There may be a restriction o how long the Goa'uld can keep theres on from off world."
0,18,32,JACK,So there's a time limit?
0,18,32,SAM,Right. Jack just nods and walks away.
0,18,33,JACK,"Start it up, give it a count of five, then blow it."
0,18,33,SOLDIER,Yes sir.
0,18,33,JACK,Good luck! Let's go! Take it up!
0,18,33,SOLDIER,Yes sir!
0,18,34,DANIEL,The first part sounds like a derivation of ancient Egyptian.
0,18,34,CATHERINE,We couldnt recognize it.
0,18,34,DANIEL,"Oh, you didn't learn how to speak it allowed on Abydos. Where did this come from?"
0,18,34,CATHERINE,It's a deep space transmission. Our receivers detected three months ago.
0,18,34,DANIEL,So why are you showing me this now?
0,18,34,SAM,Because the transmission originated from the same quadrant of space as P3R-233.
0,18,34,CATHERINE,Where your mirror is.
0,18,34,SAM,We went to 233 after we received the transmission. But the civilization had been destroyed by the Goa'uld. We didn't find any mirror though.
0,18,35,CATHERINE,"Some of 233's aliens must have sent out the warning, before there civilization was destroyed by the Goa'uld."
0,18,35,SAM,What does the rest say?
0,18,35,DANIEL,"It just says 'They come from,but then, the sentence is incomplete. There's just more sounds, pulses, beats of some kind."
0,18,35,SAM,"Yeah, we've analyzed it. Another explosion. They're divided into groups. 3, 32, 16, 8, 10 and 12."
0,18,35,DANIEL,That's six numbers.
0,18,35,SAM,Yeah.
0,18,35,DANIEL,"That's a Stargate address, just without a point of origin. Beware the destroyers, they come from: 3, 32, 16, 8, 10 and"
0,18,35,CATHERINE,"The aliens who lived on 233, found out where the Goa'uld attack originated?"
0,18,35,SAM,What like a Goa'uld home world?
0,18,35,DANIEL,"Or at least a Military base. They must have assigned a number to each symbol of the Stargate, it's a code! All we need to do is find out which symbol the Aliens represented as one and start counting from there!"
0,18,35,SAM,"Well the only unique symbol they would have is the point of origin, on 233!"
0,18,35,CATHERINE,But that symbol may not even be on our Stargate!
0,18,35,DANIEL,"Except, I have the alien gate on tape."
0,18,36,SAM,What?
0,18,36,CATHERINE,Gate is off!
0,18,37,SAM,Star dialing the gate to the Beta site!
0,18,37,HARRIMAN,Chevron one is already encoded!
0,18,37,SAM,"If we can dial in before the Goa'uld can establish a wormhole, we can get out of here!"
0,18,37,HARRIMAN,Chevron 2 encoded!
0,18,37,DANIEL,Can they dial in once we have started dialing out?
0,18,37,SAM,"Yes, we have to get the 7th chevron locked in order to stop an incoming wormhole."
0,18,37,HARRIMAN,Chevron 3 encoded!
0,18,38,JACK,Everybody ready?
0,18,38,SOLDIER,Sir!
0,18,38,SOLDIER 2,Let's do it boys!
0,18,38,SOLDIER,Right sir!
0,18,38,SOLDER 3,Yes sir!
0,18,40,HARRIMAN,Chevron 5 encoded!
0,18,40,DANIEL,"Come on , come on, come on!"
0,18,41,SAM,No!
0,18,41,HARRIMAN,Off world activation!
0,18,41,CATHERINE,You're going to have to make the computer dial up faster for the next time.
0,18,41,SAM,I'll see what I can do.
0,18,41,CATHERINE,How long can the Goa'uld keep the wormhole active?
0,18,41,SAM,"Well based on the start and end of there last activation, it looks like they can keep one established from off-world for 38 minutes."
0,18,41,DANIEL,We may not have that much time.
0,18,42,JACK,Fall back!!
0,18,42,SOLDIER,Fall back! Go! Go! Go!
0,18,42,JACK,"Seal it off, and move out!"
0,18,44,DANIEL,This symbol has to be the point of origin.
0,18,44,HAMMOND,"How's it going up there, gentlemen?"
0,18,44,JACK,"Getting the crap beat out of us, hows it going here?"
0,18,44,SAM,"I'm estimating it will be 25, before we can try opening the gate."
0,18,44,HAMMOND,"And when we do, Dr. Langford here, has presented us with an interesting dilemma. She seems to think we have been handed the address to the Goauld home world. Possibly where this attack originated."
0,18,44,JACK,Well send a bomb through.
0,18,44,DANIEL,"Excuse me? Um, I'm sorry, I know you all think of me as an outsider here, but what good would that do? I mean forget the fact that it won't change whats happening here, how do you know they don't have some kind of iris, like yours. I mean this could all be for nothing."
0,18,44,SAM,"Yeah, we probably only have one shot at dialing out. We use that one opportunity to dial up a Goauld world, we'll never get out of here ourselves."
0,18,45,CATHERINE,My god.
0,18,45,JACK,What the hell is that?
0,18,45,DANIEL,My reality.
0,18,45,SAM,"We are actually looking at ourselves in a parallel universe. Another versions of our lives, that actually exists! It's incredible."
0,18,45,JACK,It's supposed to be theoretical.
0,18,45,SAM,Not anymore. When we first began with Einsteins theories of relativity...
0,18,45,HAMMOND,Who is this?
0,18,45,DANIEL,"That is Teal'c. Big guy with a gold emblem on his head, and a Goauld in his stomach."
0,18,45,CATHERINE,We just saw him on the security camera. He's the Goauld that led the invasion into the base.
0,18,45,DANIEL,"Well he was and probably still is, the first prime of Apophis. He would be charged with a very important mission. Look this is going to sound pretty selfish, but where I come from, none of this has happened yet. Im my reality, the Earth that I know, still has a chance."
0,18,45,JACK,You want to explain that?
0,18,45,DANIEL,"If this address really does lead to a Goa'uld world, where the attack originated, and I can get this information, back to my world, well then maybe I can stop this, before it starts there."
0,18,45,SAM,What makes you think the Goauld are even going to try attacking the Earth in your universe?
0,18,45,DANIEL,"Oh I would say we have pissed the Goa'uld off, as much as you have, probably even more."
0,18,45,JACK,"Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, let me get this straight. You want us to give up our last chance to strike back at the Goa'uld, so we can save ourselves in, what?"
0,18,45,SAM,Alternate realty.
0,18,45,DANIEL,"Not just yourselves, everyone on Earth!"
0,18,45,JACK,Your Earth.
0,18,45,DANIEL,"The Jack O'Neill that I know, would do it."
0,18,45,JACK,"Well apparently, you and I have never met."
0,18,45,DANIEL,"No, I guess not. Look all I know, is because I came here, I have seen what, can happen. And I have a chance, to keep this from happening from the Earth that I come from, if you help me!"
0,18,45,JACK,Looks at Sam. How much time doctor?
0,18,45,SAM,22 minutes.
0,18,45,JACK,Okay the argument is academic. We could never hold them that long anyway.
0,18,45,DANIEL,Well maybe we could buy some time.
0,18,45,JACK,How?
0,18,45,DANIEL,"Not, how,who."
0,18,46,JACK,Whoa. Your kidding right?
0,18,46,DANIEL,"You've seen the video tape. In my reality, Jack O'Neill, convinced Teal'c, to betray Apophis, to save our lives. Teal'c gave up everything for the slim chance that we could help free his people from slavery."
0,18,46,JACK,"It doesnt exactly look like we could help him do anything right now. Keep in mind we just sent a bomb off to his planet, there might not be anything left for us to save."
0,18,46,DANIEL,Not in this universe.
0,18,46,JACK,"You expect me to explain all this to him, don't you."
0,18,46,DANIEL,"He's very smart, I bet he'll understand."
0,18,46,SAM,"How do you know he is even remotely the same Jaffa, that you know in your universe."
0,18,46,CATHERINE,Not everythings the same here.
0,18,46,DANIEL,"No, it's not, but it is close. Look, I know what I am asking here, it's insane. Look if you don't want to help me, I understand. It's your lives, your world."
0,18,46,JACK,"All I really have to do, is buy a little time. A few minutes to get the gate open, right?"
0,18,46,CATHERINE,That video tape of that Jaffa and you should catch his attention.
0,18,46,HAMMOND,You're going to talk to this guy about alternate realities?
0,18,46,SAM,Do you really think he's right about this Jaffa?
0,18,46,JACK,He was right about my son.
0,18,46,DANIEL,Thank you.
0,18,46,JACK,I think this is where you all wish me good luck. With that he walks away.
0,18,46,SAM,Jack...
0,18,47,CATHERINE,I take it they're not engaged in your reality?
0,18,47,DANIEL,No.
0,18,48,HAMMOND,"The enemy, will most likely penetrate this level, anytime now. But every minute counts. If and when we get the Stargate open from our end, we will retreat through it. But until then, we must keep theme away from the control room, and the Stargate, at any cost. Understood?"
0,18,48,AIRMEN,Yes sir!
0,18,48,HAMMOND,"Your efforts and your dedication, have always made me proud to serve with all of you."
0,18,48,AIRMAN,"Bravo company move out! Formation three. Alfa team, level four."
0,18,49,TEAL'C,Kree!
0,18,49,JACK,Don't shoot! I'm unarmed. I surrender.
0,18,49,TEAL'C,And you are?
0,18,49,JACK,"General Jack O'Neill, commander of this base. You're Teal'c, right?"
0,18,49,JAFFA,Haga'sha!
0,18,49,TEAL'C,Aga kree!
0,18,49,JACK,You'll be wondering how I know your name. I've got quite a story to tell you.
0,18,50,SAM,"Okay I've got the dial in time down another five seconds. Now, all we need is for that wormhole to destabilize"
0,18,50,HAMMOND,"Airmen, were going to need all the help we can get down there. We should set the auto destruction to go off, two minutes past the estimated window of opportunity for us to open the Stargate. If the Goauld's want this place in one piece, I intend to disappoint them."
0,18,52,TEAL'C,What sort of deception is this?
0,18,52,JACK,"I know it's a little hard to believe, but you guys are pretty advanced. You must know this alternate reality thing, is possible, right?"
0,18,52,TEAL'C,I do not.
0,18,52,JACK,"Well then how did this Daniel guy know your name? He says the guy in this video, you I guess in his world, hates being a slave to the Goauld."
0,18,52,TEAL'C,Lies.
0,18,52,JACK,"Look, I know this sounds insane. But you have a chance to change things in his world. We just need a little time, thats all. This guy, Daniel says, the Teal'c in his world, is a good man. That he betrayed Apophis to free his world, to free his family. Your wife! Your son, Ryac."
0,18,52,TEAL'C,"We received word from my home world. You sent a weapon of destruction there, through your Stargate. My people, my family are dead."
0,18,54,CATHERINE,Four minutes. You two better get into the gate room.
0,18,54,SAM,Catherine.
0,18,54,CATHERINE,"No arguments Doctor, they need you at the Beta site."
0,18,54,DANIEL,What about you?
0,18,54,CATHERINE,"As soon as I start the dial in process, Ill join you. Go!"
0,18,54,DANIEL,"If this mirror is a door way between our dimensions, I might be able to send help from my reality, or even have you come through to my Earth."
0,18,54,CATHERINE,"Wait a minute, if that device I saw is a remote control to the mirror, you may need it."
0,18,54,SAM,"Go ahead, I'll get it."
0,18,54,DANIEL,Thank you.
0,18,54,CATHERINE,"You helped me reunite me with Earnest in the other world? Danny nods. I guess in the grand scheme of things, we're even!"
0,18,55,HARRIMAN,Fall back Colonel! We have to fall back!
0,18,57,CATHERINE,Two minutes!
0,18,58,SAM,I surrender! I have information that will help Apophis! There is technology he will want to know about. I can tell Apophis how to find it!
0,18,58,JAFFA,Masa'trey'ak!
0,18,58,SAM,Thank you.
0,18,59,SAM,I also wish to blow us all to hell.
0,18,60,CATHERINE,Times up!
0,18,61,DANIEL,Come on!
0,18,62,"""AUTO DESTRUCT IN","One minute!"""
0,18,63,""" AUTO DESTRUCT IN","30 seconds! """
0,18,64,""" AUTO DESTRUCT IN","10 seconds, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2,"
0,18,67,JACK,Any luck?
0,18,67,SAM,Nothing.
0,18,68,JACK,Daniel! Jack bends over him. What the hell is this?
0,18,68,TEAL'C,It appears to be caused by a staff weapon.
0,18,69,SAM,This looks like a Stargate address.
0,18,69,JACK,"Alright, let's get him back to Earth."
0,18,69,DANIEL,No! Jack! Where all in very big trouble!They're coming! They're coming!
