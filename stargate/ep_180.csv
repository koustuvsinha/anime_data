0,180,0,"""BABYLON""",By Damian Kindler
0,180,1,MITCHELL,What you got?
0,180,1,TEALC,Shhh
0,180,1,MITCHELL,Jaffa?
0,180,1,TEALC,Quiet. *After a few minutes he moves on again.* It is nothing.
0,180,1,MITCHELL,*turns to Jackson* hes not doing that on purpose is he? You know...just to keep me interested?
0,180,1,JACKSON,Well uh...that depends...are you losing interest?
0,180,1,MITCHELL,Nah...We havent found so much as a snapped twig on this planet...but hey! Me? Its all good baby.
0,180,1,CARTER,Tealcs Intel did suggest that the Sodan would have a base of operations here
0,180,1,MITCHELL,Yeah but...Tealcs Intel came from a bunch of Jaffa he used to be at war with...I know. Old enemys new allies...and all that jazz but still...
0,180,1,CARTER,You think the informations Bad?
0,180,1,MITCHELL,"Think its vague... *after a minute, puts on a mechanic voice* A world once inhabited by ancients...A village shrouded in the midsts of timesounds like a movie trailer."
0,180,1,JACKSON,Well we found some interesting things based on vague.
0,180,1,MITCHELL,Mmm yeah...still Im getting that grasping at straws feeling.
0,180,1,JACKSON,Yeah...just dont tell Tealc *Tealc obviously listening*
0,180,1,MITCHELL,I already did.
0,180,1,JACKSON,Yeah...whatd he say?
0,180,1,MITCHELL,*imitating Tealc* The warriors of the Sodan exists colonel Mitchell. I am certain of it. *Tealc obviously not impressed*
0,180,1,JACKSON,Needs more Base.
0,180,2,MITCHELL,Down!!!!
0,180,3,MITCHELL,"Fall back to the Gate! Ive got our six! Go! GO! Go! *they all fire hurrying past him toward Gate, Mitchell fires covering them, trying to figure out where the shots are coming from* where the hell are they? *he turns coming face to face with a Jaffa who hits him with his staff weapon*"
0,180,4,MITCHELL,arrghhhh
0,180,4,CARTER,"*leaning against tree, grabs radio* SG-22, this is SG-1 we are under attack...we need back-up. *continues firing to Jackson* Where the Hell is Mitchell?!"
0,180,4,CARTER,Cameron Whats your position?
0,180,6,CARTER,*into radio* Cameron? Do you copy?
0,180,7,JOLAN,His wound is grave my lord... his Symbiote is badly damaged. *moves over to Mitchell to attack him*
0,180,7,HAIKON,No! *stops Jolan* Bring him!
0,180,8,HAIKON,Shell Kree
0,180,10,JOLAN,He will be dead by sunset...if not sooner
0,180,10,HAIKON,then...you must keep him alive.
0,180,12,CARTER,*into radio* Carter to SGC. got anything yet chief?
0,180,12,HARRIMAN,Colonel. Were reading UAV telemetry 5 by 5...so far no sign of colonel Mitchell
0,180,12,CARTER,let me know when youve completed your first sweep.
0,180,12,HARRIMAN,affirmative. SGC out
0,180,13,JACKSON,anything?
0,180,13,CARTER,not yet. Hows he doing?
0,180,13,JACKSON,not well...
0,180,13,TEALC,His Symbiote is dying... if it is not removed...the host will die also.
0,180,13,CARTER,Sgt. Radio Doctor Lam... let her know we have a priority one medical emergency incoming. *the airman heads off* No tattoo.
0,180,13,TEALC,he is a warrior of the Sodan
0,180,13,JACKSON,"according to the legend, no Sodan has been indentured to the Goauld for over 5,000 years."
0,180,13,CARTER,so your Intel was correct.
0,180,13,TEALC,indeed.
0,180,13,RAIMI,Colonel Carter... theres something you need to see...
0,180,14,TEALC,this writing...?
0,180,14,JACKSON,Ancient.
0,180,14,CARTER,look familiar?
0,180,14,JACKSON,nope. Tealc?
0,180,14,TEALC,I have never before seen such a device.
0,180,14,CARTER,well Im detecting energy signatures...its definitely some form of technology
0,180,14,TEALC,perhaps this is how the Sodan managed to escape so quickly.
0,180,14,JACKSON,actually thats exactly what it is. It says...this is some sort of aperture...or gateway to...
0,180,14,CARTER,to where?
0,180,14,JACKSON,...enlightenment
0,180,14,CARTER,just enlightenment? Nothing more specific?
0,180,14,JACKSON,thats all it says...
0,180,15,JOLAN,Hold still!
0,180,15,MITCHELL,you know...your bedside manner totally blows...
0,180,15,JOLAN,"*pulls away* your wound is infected... it must be cleansed...or you will die. This... *takes something from shelf*will cause you a fair amount... *walks back over sits, placing the cotton by Mitchells wound*of pain"
0,180,15,MITCHELL,Gahk!! Ahhh!!
0,180,16,LANDRY,Hows it going in there? *passes Tealc file.*
0,180,16,JACKSON,touch and go. Theyve been at it for nearly six hours now...
0,180,16,TEALC,*looking through file* most Jaffas would not survive such wounds...
0,180,16,JACKSON,which means shes very good...
0,180,16,LANDRY,mmmm *proud grin* thats why shes here. Looks like you were both right about the device he was wearing... more ancient technology...
0,180,16,TEALC,a cloak of invisibility...
0,180,16,LANDRY,that explains how they were able to ambush you so easily...
0,180,16,JACKSON,what about the transporter?
0,180,16,LANDRY,Carters with a team on the planet working on it right now...so far they havent been able to even open up the damn thing...let alone turn it on...
0,180,16,JACKSON,*little annoyed* yeah sorry I couldnt have been more help...
0,180,16,LANDRY,well...one line of ancient text isnt a hell of a lot to go on... were running surface scans with Prometheus on several moons and other planets in the system...
0,180,16,TEALC,you believe colonel Mitchell is no longer on P9G-844
0,180,16,LANDRY,Its a possibility...grounds sweeps and UAV scans are all coming up empty...
0,180,17,MITCHELL,Ahhhh...
0,180,18,MITCHELL,Dont move... Dont make a sound. You call to the others...and its goodbye Jaffa...
0,180,18,JOLAN,it would seem you have me at a disadvantage...
0,180,18,MITCHELL,"certainly appears that way...now...youre gonna tell me How we go- *Jolan moves fast, knocking head back into Mitchell, he turns twists Mitchells arm and throws him over on to his back* ahhh!"
0,180,18,JOLAN,"How things seem...and how they truly are, are two very different things... for example... you are free to leave this place whenever you choose..."
0,180,18,MITCHELL,well...now you tell me? *still laying on the ground*
0,180,18,JOLAN,but to reach the Chappai would take months on foot to through the mountains of Dor tonak. No one who has attempted the journey has ever survived...
0,180,18,MITCHELL,"well...so... *struggles up, grasping bed* how did we get..."
0,180,18,JOLAN,we were brought here through the eye of the Gods.
0,180,18,MITCHELL,which is?
0,180,18,JOLAN,Your questions can wait... now that your strength has returned we shall begin jomasatelek immediately.
0,180,18,MITCHELL,well...*stands* if thats breakfast I could eat...
0,180,18,JOLAN,*grabs him by the throat choking him* you have spilled the blood of a Sodan warrior... did you think our mercy was without purpose? *lets go* Lord Haikon has decreed that you will answer for your crimes by way of Kelshaklo. Which you will battle with another warrior...and on that day... you will die....*leaves*
0,180,19,LANDRY,Ah...I take it from all the beeping; our friend is still with us...
0,180,19,LAM,that he is. Though how he survived is a mystery to me...
0,180,19,LANDRY,*chuckles* ooh *walks round to her side* Id say the nine hours you spent working on him might have something to do with it... nice work.
0,180,19,LAM,I did what I could to save it but his Symbiote was too badly damaged... we had no choice but to remove it and start him on tretonin.
0,180,19,LANDRY,as soon as he regains consciousness I want to know...
0,180,19,LAM,why? So you can interrogate him? *drinks*
0,180,19,LANDRY,*chuckles...* oh that might be more up Tealc's alley but...thats the idea...
0,180,19,LAM,well it wasnt exactly the post-op recovery I had in mind...
0,180,19,LANDRY,*nods*... well...let me know the moment he wakes up.
0,180,19,LAM,*closes eyes*...ok
0,180,21,MITCHELL,Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell. United States Air Force. *and as an afterthought* Earth *Haikon doesnt say anything so he continues* I dont know if you know whats been going on out there...but things are a little different now...The Goauld has been defeated...
0,180,21,HAIKON,"The Goauld should have been defeated 5,000 years ago... My ancestors were one of the first of the Sodan... theyre part of an elite command force under the Goauld Ishker... for years they pillaged and plundered under his name...driving fear into the Hearts of all those who would oppose his rule... the further they ascended among the ranks... the more they were able to discern the truth... that he was not a God at all...but merely an imposter. Our true Gods are those that came before us..."
0,180,21,MITCHELL,Youre talking about the Ancients...
0,180,21,HAIKON,Ishker branded my ancestors as traitors and ordered their deaths...they tried to fight... to show their brothers the faith...but the odds were too great and they were forced to flee...they set out to find kheb. Hoping that their souls would find peace...but instead their search led them to this world.
0,180,21,MITCHELL,you knew about the Goauld... but you didnt help the Jaffa defeat them...look...for the first time in their history the Jaffa are free. But it wont last without strong leadership... they need your help.
0,180,21,HAIKON,their fate is of no concern to us. I hope you are prepared to die well...Mitchell
0,180,22,TEALC,"You will not be able to break your bonds. *Volnek relaxes, Tealc and Jackson walk over...* we sought out the Sodan in peace, wishing only to open dialogue...instead you attacked us and took our comrade..."
0,180,22,VOLNEK,all enemies who transgress our sacred ground forfeit their lives.
0,180,22,JACKSON,yeah...well...you might want to post a few signs...look we just want our friend back. And we figured your fellow warriors might want to know youre still alive and kicking so...were thinking straight swap. Our guy in exchange for you.
0,180,22,VOLNEK,if your friend was taken...then mourn him...for if he is not yet dead...he soon will be.
0,180,22,TEALC,here me when I say that all free Jaffa have always had the greatest respect for the warriors of the Sodan.
0,180,22,VOLNEK,you speak of respect...yet you condemn me...without my Symbiote I will be dead soon enough...
0,180,22,TEALC,a medicine called tretonin courses through your veins...you have been freed from your burden.
0,180,22,VOLNEK,such a thing is not possible.
0,180,22,JACKSON,Oh but it is...
0,180,22,TEALC,it is very real...I assure you. It is now used by several thousand free Jaffa with No Ill effects.
0,180,22,VOLNEK,your poisons will not work. Had you any honor you would have let me die on the battlefield.
0,180,23,MITCHELL,so is it you just dont know whats going on with the rest of the Galaxy or...you really dont care?
0,180,23,JOLAN,"The Jaffa made their choice 5,000 years ago. Their affairs are of no concern of ours."
0,180,23,MITCHELL,"yeah...but how do you survive? At some point you have to go hunting for...uh *waves, points at stomach* you know..."
0,180,23,JOLAN,we raid Goauld strong holds for shipments of Symbiote's that have yet to be planted in new Jaffa. *walks over to some staffs* Such missions are rights of passage for our youngest warriors...
0,180,23,MITCHELL,well that sounds like fun.
0,180,23,JOLAN,"the fighting styles of the Sodan has been a closely guarded secret for over a hundred Generations...it is a shame you will die shortly after learning it...*throws him a staff, walks over with own, motions* attack me...*Mitchell leans on staff* you find me an unworthy opponent?"
0,180,23,MITCHELL,*picks up staff* no... its just I dont feel like-
0,180,24,MITCHELL,Ok...*sits up* uh...lets try that one more time.
0,180,25,JOLAN,you are slow...and undisciplined. if you fought your opponent today you would die without landing a single blow *throws staff down*
0,180,25,MITCHELL,*lying on back* and what happens if I refuse to fight? You just kill me?
0,180,25,JOLAN,it is an alternative you do not wish to explore...
0,180,26,TEALC,Dr Lam tells me you have refused to eat.
0,180,26,VOLNEK,the very odor of your food turns my stomach.
0,180,26,TEALC,if you are to survive without your Symbiote you require sustenance
0,180,26,VOLNEK,it is only because your drug has weakened me.
0,180,26,TEALC,on the contrary brother... it has freed you.
0,180,26,VOLNEK,what do you know of freedom? hmmm? *Tealc raises eyebrow* you who have served false Gods... Who chooses to live in the squalor rather than among his own people.
0,180,26,TEALC,I know I have heard stories of the Sodan since I was but a child. Your bravery and skill are legend among all the Jaffa.
0,180,26,VOLNEK,it is because of my failure as a warrior that I languish here now... prisoner to a former slave and his pitiful allies. Speak not of skill to me.
0,180,26,TEALC,*angry* many Jaffa have fought and died for a cause that was started by the warriors of the Sodan!
0,180,26,VOLNEK,and for what?! Instead of respecting the traditions of our ancestors you would only seek to lead them further astray.
0,180,28,JOLAN,*points* that way.
0,180,28,MITCHELL,blue is left. Red is right. Got it *gets up running other way*
0,180,29,JOLAN,Faster.
0,180,29,MITCHELL,"Bastard... *runs off, Jolan running off in other direction.*"
0,180,30,MITCHELL,uh...*leans on his knees* howd I do?
0,180,30,JOLAN,badly. Again.
0,180,30,MITCHELL,well...yeah...you stop using that gadget *goes down on one knee* I guarantee ya Ill do better.
0,180,30,JOLAN,a Sodan warrior must anticipate an attack at any moment.
0,180,30,MITCHELL,yeah well... where did you guys get those things anyways *points*
0,180,30,JOLAN,the writings of our gods instructed us on how to make many of their devices... we use them to protect our grounds...
0,180,30,MITCHELL,speaking of gods...I know this is probably taboo...but *stands taking deep breaths* I need to talk to your boss. That visitor you had yesterday... Im assuming thats not the first time hes been here...Ive met their kind before * Jolan moves to next sandbag* theyre bad news. Look...Ill do any crazy training exercise you want...*Jolan looks at him* within reason.
0,180,30,JOLAN,"finish the course in time. And Ill consider it *cuts hole in bag, sand runs*"
0,180,30,MITCHELL,you know a bag of sand with a hole in it is not an accurate timing device *Jolan points* you are an evil man *runs off*
0,180,31,HAIKON,please...sit.
0,180,31,MITCHELL,Im good...*Haikon motions with head* ok...*sits* maybe I will sit. You know Im starting to get an idea why you guys attacked us. That priors telling you that were enemies...
0,180,31,HAIKON,is he wrong?
0,180,31,MITCHELL,you could of cut us down the second we stepped through the gate but you didnt...
0,180,31,HAIKON,Generations of my people fought and died under exile...praying for the day when we could...seek the path without recrimination...when we prayed to the gods...did they hear us Mitchell? Did they once give us a sign as proof of their existence? *puts his hand down on the Book of Origin* I know that the Ori are not the ancients...but can their be any doubt that they are gods? And if they can lead us to the path of enlightenment... how can I refuse them?
0,180,31,MITCHELL,Youre making a big mistake... these Ori are not what you think they are...they are not even close...
0,180,31,HAIKON,"Dekeshan! *two Jaffa rush forward, Mitchell stands* perhaps when you face your death...in your final moments...youll understand."
0,180,31,MITCHELL,Ive already been there... I understand *walks off*
0,180,32,JOLAN,You may rest now...
0,180,32,MITCHELL,No Im good lets keep going...
0,180,32,JOLAN,You are not tired?
0,180,32,MITCHELL,6 weeks airborne training at fore benning thats tired...this is nothing...come on. If I wanna survive this kel shack low thing Im gonna need a hell of a lot more that youre teaching me...quit pussy footing around and stop holding back! Lets Go!
0,180,32,JOLAN,"*nods, grabs another staff* you believe the staff is what makes you strong. *throws him staff, swinging at him, Mitchell dodges them then blocks Jolan's stick and his swipe to his head with his hand.* the crantoe is nothing but an extension of your body. *pulls away* no true warrior depends on a weapon for strength or advantage..."
0,180,32,MITCHELL,see...thats what Im talking about.
0,180,32,JOLAN,*throws him bottle* drink.
0,180,32,MITCHELL,"*drinks, spits* Im not going to get used to this stuff..."
0,180,32,JOLAN,were it not for my teas you would have died many days ago.
0,180,32,MITCHELL,it was self defense you know...the Jaffa I killed... it was him or me...
0,180,32,JOLAN,it does not matter...the blood has been spilled our laws decree you must answer for it...
0,180,32,MITCHELL,so who was he?
0,180,32,JOLAN,His name was Volnek...a most skilled warrior.
0,180,32,MITCHELL,look...for what its worth... *Jolan looks at him* theres nothing I can say is there...
0,180,32,JOLAN,no. *walks over to him*
0,180,32,MITCHELL,so...who do I fight?
0,180,32,JOLAN,Lord Haikon will determine that on the eve of your battle...usually it is the closest blood kin to the slain warrior
0,180,32,MITCHELL,right... and the next of kin is just a tough as he was. Do I stand a chance? *Jolan raises eyebrow* never mind. I promise Ill die well and all that jazz... but before I kick it...I gotta ask...you buying what these priors are selling?
0,180,32,JOLAN,lord Haikon has led us for more that a hundred years...he knows what is best for us all...
0,180,32,MITCHELL,yeah yeah look I get it...you are a team player...Im asking...what do you think?
0,180,32,JOLAN,it is not my place to questing Haikons judgment...nor is it yours...
0,180,32,MITCHELL,well somebody better...because if you guys follow the Ori...all of you traditions...your crantoe staffs...your precious paths...your tasty beverages...its all going down the drain.
0,180,32,JOLAN,Enough! Were finished for the day.
0,180,33,TEALC,you say a prior has come to the Sodan...and you have decided to follow the word of the Ori...
0,180,33,VOLNEK,I walk the path of our true gods--
0,180,33,TEALC,The Ori are not gods!! What did the prior promise you? A place of honor at his side? As heralds for your new masters? This prior will have you hunt down and kill all Jaffa who refuse to follow the path of origin...that is the path you walk...I will learn the codes of the ancient transporter...no matter how long it takes. *Volnek smirks*
0,180,33,LANDRY,this is going no where... two weeks and he hasnt given us so much as a decent hycoo...
0,180,33,CARTER,well...its understandable sir most Jaffa will never break under normal interrogation techniques...
0,180,33,JACKSON,not to mention the Sodan are a elite group of warriors...Im sure their minds are trained to withstand a lot worse...
0,180,33,LANDRY,what about the device...*both look at Carter...*
0,180,33,CARTER,we havent made much progress Im afraid... it seems the code preventing us from using it is rigged to some sort of defense mechanism. Dr lee received a few nasty volts while trying to implement an override.
0,180,33,JACKSON,how is he?
0,180,33,CARTER,*whispers* Dr Lam says the feeling should return to his legs in a few days...
0,180,33,LANDRY,*sighs stands* meanwhile the international committee is keeping score of all the resources were using to try and find Mitchell...science teams...orbital scans by Prometheus...
0,180,33,JACKSON,all of them coming up empty certainly doesnt look good...
0,180,33,LANDRY,another few days and theyll tell us to shut down search and rescue operations...
0,180,33,CARTER,shut it down? *Jackson stands*
0,180,33,LANDRY,mmm.
0,180,33,CARTER,Sir...with all due respect...in the past we have spent months searching for our people in the field... we cant just stop looking
0,180,33,JACKSON,what shes saying sir is...weve never left a man behind...
0,180,33,LANDRY,Im more that familiar with the concept Dr Jackson...give me something I can use...soon... or the next paperwork I fill out will declare Mitchell MIA.
0,180,35,MITCHELL,I just need a minute!
0,180,35,HAIKON,let him pass...
0,180,35,MITCHELL,"*the Jaffa lower their weapons, he enters* thank you. Ok Ill make this quick... that prior represents a race of ancients...yes. But believe me when I tell you they are not the ancients you wanna worship..."
0,180,35,HAIKON,the prior has healed our sick...caused our crops to grow as if by magic. Why should I doubt the power of the Ori?
0,180,35,MITCHELL,look...their power is not what you should question...its how they use it...anyone refuses to worship them and they die...and Im not talking about a few non believers here and there...Im talking about whole planets wiped out.
0,180,35,HAIKON,and I should simply take your word for this?
0,180,35,MITCHELL,"you want to believe my people are godless and inferior... go right ahead...but we have never needed proof of our gods existence in order to believe in them... faith...it was your faith that sustained you for 5,000 years...not the ancients themselves...dont throw your history away for a bag full of magic tricks..."
0,180,36,MITCHELL,"admit it Haikon has totally lost his mind. *Mitchells blocks all Jolans attacks, Jolan stops*"
0,180,36,JOLAN,a warrior can not talk and fight at the same time. A fact you refuse to accept.
0,180,36,MITCHELL,Got it...
0,180,37,JOLAN,You may provide a challenge to your opponent after all Mitchell...
0,180,37,MITCHELL,followed by my violent death... of course *walks over to get bottle of team*
0,180,37,JOLAN,of course.
0,180,37,MITCHELL,to my inevitable demise *drinks*
0,180,37,JOLAN,why do you do this?
0,180,37,MITCHELL,do what?
0,180,37,JOLAN,train this hard? *Mitchell throws bottle at him* these are the last days of your life... I would think you would spend more time in reflection...*drinks
0,180,37,MITCHELL,well all I know is... the moment you accept your fate thats when youre as good as dead...til then all bets our off.
0,180,37,JOLAN,you cannot survive kelshaklo
0,180,37,MITCHELL,well no offence but...Ive endured things I wasnt suppose to survive before and...Im still here.
0,180,37,JOLAN,how can you be certain... the prior speaks falsely?
0,180,37,MITCHELL,because Ive seen entire planets wiped out because they refused to follow the Ori. Look Im not trying to tell you what to think... but if everything I believed was being threatened... Id wanna know... Jolan...youre people shouldnt suffer for their faith.
0,180,38,VOLNEK,You two...again...
0,180,38,JACKSON,yes...us two...again.
0,180,38,VOLNEK,save your words...I am not in the mood...
0,180,38,JACKSON,we know how you feel...but were not here to talk.
0,180,38,TEALC,you require evidence that the Ori are not to be interested. *another Jaffa enters*
0,180,38,JACKSON,this is Tassan...one of the founders of a free Jaffa settlement on a planet called Asatarus
0,180,38,TEALC,many families came to live there to enjoy the freedom that they fought so hard to achieve...
0,180,38,TASSAN,he is Sodan?
0,180,38,TEALC,indeed.
0,180,38,JACKSON,tell him what happened...
0,180,38,TASSAN,a month ago...a man came through the Chappai... he called himself a prior...he told us of powerful gods called the Ori who he claimed would give us protection...and show us the path to enlightenment...and he left. He later returned...told us we had to make a choice...follow the Ori...or be destroyed...we chose to resist... *stops*
0,180,38,TEALC,Continue Brother...
0,180,38,TASSAN,he dialed the chappai...and merely placed his staff in the ground in front of it...then the earth shook...with a fierceness I have never seen nor heard of before...in moments our cities were leveled... hundreds of our people...wiped out...in an instant.
0,180,38,VOLNEK,Enough...of these lies. You expect me to take the word of this sorry excuse for a Jaffa?
0,180,38,TASSAN,I witnessed the destruction with my own eyes! Heed my words brother... if a prior visits your world. Leave.
0,180,39,HAIKON,* hits a gong* you have spilled the blood of a Sodan warrior...human. Do you deny it?
0,180,39,MITCHELL,no. but it wasnt *glances at Jolan...* no I dont deny it.
0,180,39,HAIKON,If any blood kin...of the warrior seek recompense let him step forward now.
0,180,39,JOLAN,*Steps forward* I seek it
0,180,39,MITCHELL,You?
0,180,39,JOLAN,"in the name of Volnek of Geshrel, my brother."
0,180,40,HAIKON,may the blood spilled here today...settle this debt...once and for all. You may begin...
0,180,40,JOLAN,may you die well
0,180,40,MITCHELL,like wise...
0,180,41,HAIKON,The Human is dead. blood of the Sodan has been avenged.
0,180,41,JOLAN,He fought and died a warrior my lord...It is only fitting he be given the right of Shelmakhosa
0,180,41,HAIKON,Very well... *waves but Jolan stops him*
0,180,41,JOLAN,With your permission my lord...I would like to take care of it myself...
0,180,42,JOLAN,I was afraid you would not wake...
0,180,42,MITCHELL,oh huh...well...maybe I shouldnt have... *sits up* how long was I...
0,180,42,JOLAN,7 hours.
0,180,42,MITCHELL,7? I thought it was only suppose to be 2...
0,180,42,JOLAN,I may have inadvertently made the lexa to strong...
0,180,42,MITCHELL,yeah...oh *laughs* yeah thats going to leave a scar...so did it work?
0,180,42,JOLAN,it was most effective. They believe you are dead
0,180,42,MITCHELL,well done bones. *Jolan throws him a confused look* never mind. So...where does this leave you?
0,180,42,JOLAN,if the prior intends to mislead the Sodan as you say...then I am his enemy
0,180,42,MITCHELL,and Haikon?
0,180,42,JOLAN,it may be too late to convince him of his mistake...but there are several other warriors who feel as I do...we will continue to walk the path of the Sodan...until the others see the error of their ways...
0,180,42,MITCHELL,well for what its worth... you wont walk alone. *they give each other slight nods*
0,180,43,LANDRY,come. *Jackson enters* howd it go?
0,180,43,JACKSON,not well...even after we showed him video footage of the damage...Volnek still refuses to believe that the Ori are responsible for what happened on Asatarus...
0,180,43,LANDRY,whats he doing now?
0,180,43,JACKSON,nothing. He hasnt said a word since Tassan left...
0,180,43,LANDRY,which puts us back to square one.
0,180,43,JACKSON,yeah basically... Tealc seems to think showing more of the dam--*alarms go off*
0,180,43,UNSCHEDULED OFFWORLD ACTIVATION!,
0,180,44,LANDRY,What have we got chief?
0,180,44,HARRIMAN,receiving an IDC sir...its colonel Mitchell...
0,180,44,JACKSON,Youre kidding.
0,180,44,HARRIMAN,I would never do that sir.
0,180,45,TEALC,You have a visitor.
0,180,45,VOLNEK,*Jumps up as Mitchell enters* You!
0,180,45,MITCHELL,Yeah I thought you were dead too...
0,180,45,VOLNEK,Oh we have unfinished business
0,180,45,MITCHELL,Just take it easy...
0,180,45,VOLNEK,You shot me!
0,180,45,MITCHELL,You shot me first.
0,180,45,VOLNEK,I will have vengeance.
0,180,45,TEALC,"You. Will listen. Brother *Volnek takes a deep breath, Mitchell nods to Tealc*"
0,180,45,MITCHELL,I know that you think were enemies. And right now...it doesnt matter if we become allies...what matters is that you understand the truth.
0,180,46,VOLNEK,You are fortunate my brother drugged you. You would never have survived the true Shekloh
0,180,46,MITCHELL,dont know...took you down pretty good.
0,180,46,VOLNEK,You were lucky...
0,180,46,MITCHELL,lucky...is good.
0,180,46,VOLNEK,*Gate Kawooshes* Granting my freedom changes nothing Mitchell...*heads up ramp turns back* we will meet again.
0,180,46,MITCHELL,Looking forward to it.
