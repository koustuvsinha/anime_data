0,2,0,"""EMANCIPATION""",By Katharyn Michaelian Powers The team arrive offworld
0,2,0,DANIEL,What a mess.
0,2,0,TEAL'C,This temple was destroyed long ago.
0,2,0,JACK,Let's get a move on before we meet somebody who remembers why.
0,2,0,DANIEL,There's no sign of human life.
0,2,0,TEAL'C,This could be some forbidden zone.
0,2,0,SAM,"Wait, I hear something. It sounds like dogs."
0,2,1,ABU,Help! No! Help! Ahhh!
0,2,1,JACK,"Hey, get out of here!"
0,2,2,JACK,You okay?
0,2,2,ABU,Yes I am. Thanks be to you. But forgive me I am Abu of the Shavadai.
0,2,2,DANIEL,Shavadai
0,2,2,ABU,The people of the steppe.
0,2,2,DANIEL,Well hello! I'm Daniel Jackson this is...
0,2,2,JACK,Jack.
0,2,2,DANIEL,Jack.
0,2,2,ABU,You are not from the people of the river.
0,2,2,JACK,"Uh, no."
0,2,2,DANIEL,We are travelers from very far away.
0,2,2,ABU,The sea of Ogada?
0,2,2,JACK,Sure.
0,2,2,ABU,Never have we met anyone from that far away. You will be doubly welcome in my fathers camp.
0,2,2,DANIEL,"This is Teal'c, and this is Dr. Carter."
0,2,2,TEAL'C,The dogs are gone.
0,2,2,SAM,For now.
0,2,2,ABU,This is a women.
0,2,2,JACK,"Oh, yeah."
0,2,2,SAM,"What do I, do I have something growing out of my nose, or..."
0,2,2,DANIEL,He looks really up set. It must be some sort of cultural thing.
0,2,2,ABU,No! I cannot look at you.
0,2,2,SAM,"Okay, now I'm hurt."
0,2,2,MAN,Abu!
0,2,2,ABU,"You must take her. You must take her and go! Go! These people, are from the sea of Ogada."
0,2,2,MAN,One is a woman?
0,2,2,ABU,Yes.
0,2,2,DANIEL,"Colonel, I think these people are Mongols."
0,2,2,JACK,Is this good news?
0,2,2,SAM,"Daniel, find out what I did wrong so I can fix it."
0,2,2,ABU,"No, no, no, let them go."
0,2,2,DANIEL,"He's right, will just take her with us and go."
0,2,5,MAN,"My son, when you did not return, I feared you were dead."
0,2,5,ABU,"I would be in a dogs stomach now, but for these."
0,2,5,MAN,Is this anyway to greet a stranger?
0,2,5,HORSEMAN,That one is a women.
0,2,5,JACK,Observant bunch.
0,2,5,ABU,"Father, they come from the sea of Ogada, they do not know our ways."
0,2,5,MAN,Law is law. What manner of weapon is that?
0,2,5,SAM,"It's a firearm, it shoots like your bow shoots an arrow."
0,2,5,MAN,"She speaks, she dies."
0,2,5,ABU,No! No! She saved my life.
0,2,5,MAN,"A woman, saved a life. Hers cannot be taken. Now, your my guest, if you will travel this country, you must learn our ways."
0,2,5,SAM,I'm thinking we should just go back while were ahead.
0,2,5,DANIEL,If we learn there customs will be okay. It's an incredible opportunity to study an ancient culture up close.
0,2,6,DANIEL,"This is unbelievable. Uh, the Mongols who settled on the Persian China adapted to the local customs. But there was one tribe the Chagatai that kept the traditional life of the steppe-nomad. Maybe these Shavadai are their descendents. I mean this camp could literally belong to belong to Genghis Khan. It's a living exhibit of a way of life that's been extinct for 900 years."
0,2,6,MAN,"Ah. Please sit, now we may talk."
0,2,6,SAM,"Good, cause I still don't understand what happened out there."
0,2,6,MAN,"Among our people, it is death for a women to show her face in public."
0,2,6,ABU,Or to wear the clothes of a man.
0,2,6,MAN,"The old laws weight heavily, it is well you saved Abu from the dogs. It gave me a way to prevent your death."
0,2,6,SAM,Thank you for that.
0,2,6,MAN,"Soon, the old laws, and the old ways will no longer serve us. Trade will one day replace war this is the future. We have strongest, fastest horses and camels. The finest wool..."
0,2,6,ABU,And medicines. Drugs of unheard of power.
0,2,6,JACK,"Oh, we have some pretty swell drugs of our own."
0,2,6,SAM,"Colonel, a lot of breakthrough in medicines are coming out of the mountains, and the jungles, we should really see what he's got."
0,2,6,ABU,"I will show you, follow me."
0,2,7,MAN,I'm afraid you cannot go until properly attired.
0,2,7,SAM,Properly attired?
0,2,7,DANIEL,"You should probably do what they want. Um, anthropologists do it all the time. They, dress and live the people they're studying."
0,2,7,SAM,"Well, I'm not an anthropologist."
0,2,7,JACK,You are today.
0,2,8,ABU,"I use the medicine on the wound from a fire arrow, in a recent skirmish. Shoulder was badly burned. From the moment I began treatment, there was no pain."
0,2,8,DANIEL,This could be an antistatic we haven't seen before.
0,2,8,JACK,We should take some back to test it.
0,2,8,DANIEL,Yeah.
0,2,9,SAM,"Daniel, find me an anthropologist that dresses like this and I will eat this head dress."
0,2,9,ABU,You are the most beautiful women I have ever seen.
0,2,9,SAM,"I guess the kid doesn't get out much. Look uh, I will not wear this thing over my face. I don't care how much embroidery it has on it. And this dress, or whatever it's called, I mean I can't move, I can't walk."
0,2,9,JACK,"I don't know, It kind of works for me."
0,2,9,DANIEL,"It's, it's you, it's..."
0,2,9,JACK,It's you.
0,2,9,DANIEL,"Definitely you. Uh, uh the good news is, uh you were right. One of Abu's plants seems to work as an anesthetic. Were taking some home to get it anayised."
0,2,9,JACK,"All things considered, Samantha, if we have to come back here, it might be a better idea to bring an all male team. No offence."
0,2,9,SAM,"Well, in view of the fact that you all get to go to this party tonight and I get to stay in the yurt, that smalls like rancid yak butter, none taken. I'll just get a good nights sleep, and hope for better luck next time."
0,2,9,JACK,You going to be alright?
0,2,9,SAM,Still doubting me? I haven't been afraid of the dark since I was two.
0,2,9,JACK,You look great.
0,2,11,DANIEL,"Doctor, were about ready to go.Doctor, were about ready to..No."
0,2,11,SAM,"You better kill me now, because I am going to talk."
0,2,11,ABU,"Here, you may eat and drink."
0,2,11,SAM,What the hell do you think your doing?
0,2,11,ABU,"There is something I want more then life itself. Until yesterday I thought it was impossible. And then I saw you, dressed like that. And I knew, your beauty would buy it for me."
0,2,11,SAM,What do you mean buy?
0,2,11,ABU,I will trade you.
0,2,11,SAM,You can't do that.
0,2,11,ABU,I can.
0,2,11,SAM,"I'm a human being, not property."
0,2,11,ABU,"Where we are going, the men aren't as tolerant as my father. Be warned."
0,2,12,JACK,Any signs?
0,2,12,DANIEL,"No, no one has seen her since last night."
0,2,12,JACK,"Alright, find Teal'c, I want everybody geared up and ready to move out in 15 minutes."
0,2,12,DANIEL,"Okay, let me talk to Mughal first, this might be another misunderstanding, cultural differences."
0,2,12,JACK,"The hell with culture, a member of my team has been neutralized. That's a hostile act."
0,2,12,DANIEL,How is it that you always come up with the worst case scenario?
0,2,12,JACK,I practice.
0,2,13,TEAL'C,I found fresh hoof prints leading out of the camp.
0,2,13,JACK,That's great.
0,2,13,TEAL'C,The horse should be identifiable. One of the hoofs was splayed.
0,2,13,MUGHAL,"The horse belongs to my son, he is also missing."
0,2,13,JACK,"Okay dad, what's going on here?"
0,2,13,MUGHAL,I am as ignorant as you.
0,2,13,JACK,"I don't think so. Now he tool Captain Carter, I want to know why."
0,2,13,MUGHAL,"Among the Shaved, women are valued highly for trade. Foreign women, most of all."
0,2,13,JACK,can you help me track them?
0,2,13,TEAL'C,"Now that I know what to look for, I believe so."
0,2,13,DANIEL,"If Abu gives her up peacefully, no one will get hurt.Right?"
0,2,13,JACK,We will do our best.
0,2,13,MUGHAL,"I will give you horses, and guide you myself. My son has betrayed me as well as you."
0,2,14,ABU,"Turghan, I bid you welcome. I have come to trade."
0,2,14,TURGHAN,"Then come Shavadai. See the son of my enemy, how he pales in my presence. You risk your head coming here. For what, you think this interests me?"
0,2,14,ABU,Yes.
0,2,15,SAM,"I don't belong to this man, I was abducted against my will."
0,2,15,TURGHAN,Where is she from?
0,2,15,ABU,The sea of Ogada.
0,2,15,SAM,"My friends will come after me, they have weapons more powerful then you can imagine and they won't hesitate..."
0,2,15,TURGHAN,"Silence, or I will have you beaten."
0,2,15,ABU,"You may do whatever you wish with her, when she is yours."
0,2,15,TURGHAN,Then I would see her.
0,2,15,ABU,Turn around.
0,2,15,SAM,No.
0,2,16,TURGHAN,Slowly.Your skin is very fair. Look at me! Her eyes are the color of blue river stones.Sit.
0,2,16,ABU,Are you satisfied?
0,2,16,TURGHAN,Name your price.
0,2,17,TURGHAN,"Why do you hesitate? Name it, gold, horses, weapons. I have the finest metal craftsmen in the mountains."
0,2,17,ABU,No.
0,2,17,TURGHAN,"Well, what then."
0,2,17,ABU,Nya.
0,2,17,TURGHAN,"You would trade a woman, for another women?"
0,2,17,ABU,Nya is not just another women.
0,2,17,TURGHAN,No she is my daughter. She will marry a chieftain. The desert warlord Chimaka.
0,2,17,NYA,"Father, please."
0,2,17,TURGHAN,It is done! Chimaka will come on the next moon.
0,2,17,NYA,That's three days.
0,2,17,SAM,How can you do that to your own daughter?
0,2,17,TURGHAN,"Your beauty will not soften my anger much longer. The offer of the women is 300 weights of gold. Take it or die, either way the women is mine."
0,2,17,ABU,Done.
0,2,18,TURGHAN,"Here, a women does not speak, unless she is spoken to."
0,2,19,TEAL'C,They stopped here.
0,2,19,MUGHAL,"To rest the horses, and so must we. For two marks. If we do not find them, I will pay whatever you ask for the loss of Carter."
0,2,19,DANIEL,"We can't do that, we don't own our women."
0,2,19,MUGHAL,Truly?
0,2,19,DANIEL,"Yes, and we heard stories about Shavadai women, that once they were free, some were even warriors, fought with there husband in battles. Mongol women might have been the legendary Amazons."
0,2,19,MUGHAL,"Shhh, we do not speak of it. The laws for women were made to protect and hide them from the demons, who brought us to this place."
0,2,19,TEAL'C,Demons?
0,2,19,MUGHAL,"It is only legend, and long time ago, the dawn of our time."
0,2,19,TEAL'C,"If the demons are gone, why have not the laws been changed?"
0,2,19,MUGHAL,"Some say they will return. I say it is an excuse for my men to have their way. Among the Shavadai, even the lowest man is chief among his women."
0,2,19,DANIEL,Is that why you only have one wife? To set a type of example?
0,2,19,MUGHAL,My people see it as a weakness.
0,2,19,DANIEL,Because you love her?
0,2,20,NYA,My father will kill you.
0,2,20,ABU,Come away with me. Tonight.
0,2,20,NYA,"You know I cannot, now go before they find you here."
0,2,20,ABU,"I have listened to the wind, you will come. I will wait for you by the tem tree."
0,2,21,TURGHAN,"Now you are Tugai, women of the forest. What can you do? Can you cook? Spin weave, make dyes?"
0,2,21,SAM,"I'm a lousy cook, and I couldn't spin weave or dye if my life depended on it. You made yourself a bad deal."
0,2,21,TURGHAN,"Where you come from, you must have done something."
0,2,21,SAM,"In my world, I am a warrior and a scholar, I do the work of men."
0,2,21,TURGHAN,"A warrior. Let me tell you what I do. I raid and burn the tents of my enemies. I slaughter the men and trade the women and children. For this, I am feared. And because of that fear, I have the allegiance of 22 tribes."
0,2,21,SAM,But you have to sell your own daughter to make it 23?
0,2,21,TURGHAN,"How would you like to be hung upside down, with dust filled rags stuffed in your mouth and nostrils? A slow death from suffocation."
0,2,21,SAM,"I'm sorry, I'm sure you know what's best for her."
0,2,21,TURGHAN,"The spirits have brought you here to teach you, how to be a woman."
0,2,22,GUARD,You belong to Turghan!
0,2,22,SAM,"Get your hands off me, let me go!"
0,2,23,TURGHAN,"What kind of women are you? Do you respect nothing? Care for no one but yourself? These were responsible for you, now because of you, the will be punished."
0,2,23,SAM,"No! It was my fault, if you need to beat a women to feel like a man, try me."
0,2,23,TURGHAN,"I value spirit in my horses, not my women. You belong to me, you will learn your place, and be obedient. You will suffer far worse then a beating."
0,2,23,NYA,I heard what you did for my mother.I am grateful.
0,2,23,SAM,It's okay.
0,2,23,NYA,"We are all afraid. If you do not obey, my father will kill you."
0,2,23,SAM,I know.
0,2,23,NYA,"My father's a good man, he never mistreats a women unless she has done something wrong."
0,2,23,SAM,"There is no excuse to beat a women, ever."
0,2,23,NYA,"He's a powerful warlord! Our women and children are always protected, always have food."
0,2,23,SAM,"How can you defend him, he's packing you off to marry a total stranger."
0,2,23,NYA,"I have no choice, I am not free to choose."
0,2,23,SAM,And you never will be until one of you say's no.
0,2,23,NYA,"I want to say it, will you help me?"
0,2,24,TEAL'C,The tracks lead directly there.
0,2,24,JACK,Who owns the place?
0,2,24,MUGHAL,An enemy. A man who kills for pleasure. This is very bad.
0,2,24,JACK,Well then we will go and get her tonight.
0,2,24,MUGHAL,"If we attack, there will be war. Turghan is allied with 22 clans. When he fights, he takes no prisoners."
0,2,24,DANIEL,You mean they'd kill all of you?
0,2,24,MUGHAL,"Yes. If you will wait until morning, I will go, and request a trade, he cannot refuse."
0,2,24,TEAL'C,But what will happen to Dr. Carter tonight if we wait.
0,2,24,MUGHAL,Turghan will partake in his newest purchase.
0,2,24,JACK,"Oh, there's not a chance in hell."
0,2,24,DANIEL,"In our land, if a man wants a women, she can say no."
0,2,24,MUGHAL,"No one refuses, Turghan, and lives."
0,2,24,JACK,Then we go now.
0,2,24,MAN,Stop!
0,2,25,SAM,"Yes! Go, go Nya, go."
0,2,25,TURGHAN,I paid 300 weights of gold.
0,2,25,DANIEL,Is that a lot?
0,2,25,MUGHAL,Enough to buy ten women.
0,2,25,JACK,How much are you willing to spend to get her back?
0,2,25,MUGHAL,We will offer 350 weights of gold.
0,2,25,TURGHAN,She is difficult. But beautiful. A rare prize.
0,2,25,DANIEL,Four hundred.
0,2,25,MUGHAL,Four hundred.
0,2,25,TURGHAN,I may even make her a wife.
0,2,25,JACK,"Oh for crying out loud, 500!Will pay you back."
0,2,25,TURGHAN,"Why this one? I have others younger, fit to bare many sons, enough to start your own tribe."
0,2,25,DANIEL,"She is a women of power for our people. Not only a warrior but a...shaman, she know the spirits of our land. They will tell her when it's time to plant, when water will be scarce, Things like that."
0,2,25,TURGHAN,You take me for a fool?
0,2,25,MUGHAL,"He speaks truly. In the land of Ogada, the women are as ours were long ago."
0,2,25,DANIEL,"That and more! Carter is our chieftain, our people need her."
0,2,25,TURGHAN,Get out. You have nothing I want.
0,2,25,JACK,Oh yeah?
0,2,26,TURGHAN,Done.
0,2,27,JACK,"Alright, there are only five more rounds in that clip, time to go."
0,2,28,SAM,"What a relief, I have never been so happy to see you guys."
0,2,28,JACK,"Oh, sure you have, remember that time on P3X-595, you drank that stuff that made you take off.."
0,2,28,SAM,"We won't get into that now. Mughal, I want to thank you for your help."
0,2,28,MUGHAL,Will leave at first light.
0,2,28,SAM,"I don't blame you for what Abu did, I don't blame him neither, now."
0,2,28,MUGHAL,"He is suffering the madness, as I did when I was young."
0,2,28,DANIEL,It's what they call love.
0,2,28,SAM,"Ah, got it."
0,2,29,ABU,"Please, you must help me."
0,2,29,SAM,What happened? Where's Nya?
0,2,29,ABU,"She came to me, just like the wind said she would. But before we could make our way her father caught us. Now if you do not help me, she will be stoned to death. Curse me for the madness, better to have left her to marry Chimakka."
0,2,29,MUGHAL,I would not see anything I cared for go to Chimakka.
0,2,29,JACK,"Can I get a little clarification here? Her own father ordered her stoned to death, is that right?"
0,2,29,ABU,Because she broke the law of the land.
0,2,29,MUGHAL,"Turghan is compelled to uphold the law, even more if it applies to his own. He must rule by example."
0,2,29,SAM,"We have to go back, now!"
0,2,29,JACK,Negative.
0,2,29,SAM,She can't be more then 16 or 17!
0,2,29,JACK,"Captain, if we go in there and try to get that little girl out, we could be starting a war we could be starting a war on this planet."
0,2,29,SAM,"Since when are you a politician, Colonel."
0,2,29,JACK,"Easy, Captain."
0,2,29,SAM,"De Opresso Liber. To free from oppression, special forces motto."
0,2,29,JACK,"I know what it is. That's our world, this is there's."
0,2,29,DANIEL,Do we have the right to interfere with there customs or reinterpret their laws?
0,2,29,SAM,"Maybe you guy aren't getting this, but they're about to kill this teenage girl! Simply because she fell in love with this boy!"
0,2,29,ABU,"Please, use your weapons, and free her."
0,2,29,MUGHAL,"The Colonel is right. It would mean war, Abu. My son, you must choose, between one women, and your people."
0,2,29,ABU,I cannot.
0,2,29,SAM,"Neither can I, Nya broke the law because of me. I can't leave her here to die."
0,2,29,TEAL'C,"But if it is one life, or many."
0,2,29,DANIEL,"Wait. Now there has to be another way. Mughal, what about the old laws? Isn't there something that we can."
0,2,29,ABU,"Yes. If we fight with law, Turghan cannot make war. Father, please, think, remember, there must be a law."
0,2,29,MUGHAL,There is one.
0,2,30,NYA,"Father, forgive me."
0,2,30,TURGHAN,I forgive you. Stone her!
0,2,31,MUGHAL,Do not!
0,2,31,TURGHAN,"You have no say here, Shavadai."
0,2,31,ABU,Stoning may be challenged. By another chieftain.
0,2,31,TURGHAN,There is no such law.
0,2,31,MUGHAL,"There is. In the song of Arkan-tyr, the sprits will strengthen the hand of the just."
0,2,31,TURGHAN,I will not fight a cripple.
0,2,31,MUGHAL,You must.
0,2,31,TURGHAN,You insult my honor by implying that I would engage in such a slaughter. You will lose and my daughter will still die. So unless there is another chieftain who will challenge my decision.
0,2,31,SAM,I challenge it.
0,2,31,TURGHAN,You? You plague me.
0,2,31,SAM,"Then fight, here's your chance to shut me up once and for all."
0,2,31,TURGHAN,I will abide by the wisdom of the spirits. Let them decide justly.
0,2,31,JACK,"So when your backs up against the wall and there's no tomorrow, just take one day at a time, and remember the bigger they are, etcetera."
0,2,31,SAM,You don't think I can win.
0,2,31,JACK,Sure I do. I assume you have at least some basic hand-to hand training.
0,2,31,SAM,"Yeah, level three, advanced."
0,2,31,JACK,"You'll do fine. Just out of curiosity, how do the sprits determine who wins?"
0,2,31,MUGHAL,"It is a fight, to the death."
0,2,31,JACK,Death?
0,2,32,NYA,"Carter, please do not kill him."
0,2,32,SAM,I do not want to.
0,2,32,NYA,"You have won, I am free to go with Abu."
0,2,32,SAM,I want to hear it from you.
0,2,32,TURGHAN,She's free to go.
0,2,32,SAM,And the Shavadai?
0,2,32,TURGHAN,"By law, there can be no war between us."
0,2,32,SAM,And me?And me?
0,2,32,TURGHAN,You have won. You are also free to go.
0,2,33,MUGHAL,You will not stay for the weeding?
0,2,33,JACK,"Aw, a six day weeding, you know we really should get back."
0,2,33,ABU,It is a joyous time!
0,2,33,DANIEL,"But we all wish you and Nya many years of happiness, and many sons too."
0,2,33,MUGHAL,"All Shavadai, be free!"
0,2,34,MUGHAL,"It is how, you will be remembered, Carter."
0,2,35,SAM,So you thing this new anesthesia will be a new miracle drug on Earth?
0,2,35,DANIEL,"Well if it is, I bet somebody else will get the credit. We can never say were it came from."
0,2,35,JACK,Damn. Guess I'm going to have to cancel that Oprah interview.
0,2,35,TEAL'C,What is an Oprah?
