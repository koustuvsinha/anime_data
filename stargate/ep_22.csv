0,22,0,"""IN THE LINE OF DUTY""","By Robert C. Cooper SG1 are offworld, in the middle of a battle. People are injured and running around screaming. The team are trying to help"
0,22,0,JACK,"Let's go Captain, those gliders are coming back around!"
0,22,0,SAM,This man's alive!
0,22,0,JACK,We cannot wait!
0,22,1,DANIEL,"Okay, come on, come on. Don't panic, we'll have you out of here in a minute."
0,22,1,JACK,Teal'c! I gotta go back for Carter.
0,22,1,DANIEL,"He's alive, but I think he's gonna wish he wasn't. Let's get him outta here."
0,22,2,JACK,Carter! We've got to go! You alright?
0,22,2,SAM,Yeah.
0,22,2,JACK,"Let's get him outta here, come on."
0,22,2,SAM,Dead! Had some kind of seizure. Bit his own tongue.
0,22,3,HAMMOND,I want a full medical quarantine until these people can be examined. Colonel O'Neill and the rest?
0,22,3,DANIEL,"Right behind me, and a dozen Jaffa right behind them."
0,22,3,HAMMOND,Lock it up
0,22,3,JACK,Carter? You okay?
0,22,3,SAM,"Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks."
0,22,4,DANIEL,There hadn't been any Goa'uld interference on this planet for over three centuries. The Nasyians are... are... were a peaceful people. They were eager to form an alliance and aid us in setting up a research outpost. There was no warning this attack was coming. We hadn't even spotted the mothership by the time the Gliders assaulted the village.
0,22,4,HAMMOND,"It's not normal for the Goa'ulds to suddenly just show up and wipe out peaceful people for no apparent reason, is it?"
0,22,4,DANIEL,"In the past there was usually some reason, most often they seem to attack civilisations that are advancing to a point where their technology could be a threat, but that wasn't the case here."
0,22,4,JACK,Maybe they found out we were there.
0,22,4,DANIEL,"Well how could they know? Or more importantly, why did this particular Goa'uld care?"
0,22,4,JACK,They might have been a little concerned because we just kicked the crap out of Apophis.
0,22,4,DANIEL,"Well, the truth is we still understand very little about their society."
0,22,4,TEAL'C,"I have seen the Goa'uld wipe out entire civilisations for no reason, simply because it gave them pleasure."
0,22,4,DANIEL,"So what, Nasyia was just next on the list? Part of me wishes it was that simple, but I don't want to underestimate them."
0,22,5,TEAL'C,That is true.
0,22,5,DANIEL,I agree with Sam. I think we have to assume the Goa'uld are more complex as a society than we're giving them credit for.
0,22,5,SAM,The better you understand the enemy the better prepared you are in conflict.
0,22,5,DANIEL,Exactly.
0,22,5,HAMMOND,What's the status of the Nasyian survivors?
0,22,5,DANIEL,"Well, we managed to recuse 237 people. The critically burned and some of the overflow our infirmary couldn't handle were transferred to the Air Force Academy hospital. The rest are awaiting relocation."
0,22,5,HAMMOND,Proceed.
0,22,5,DANIEL,"Sir, I think it's important to try and find the reason why Nasyia became a Goa'uld target."
0,22,5,HAMMOND,Agreed! But relocation is the first priority. I'm assigning the three new SG teams 10 through 12 to co-ordinate with you. Dismissed.
0,22,5,JACK,"Oh, Carter, I hate to be a nag about this but old Doc Fraiser says you haven't been checked out yet?"
0,22,5,SAM,"I'll go right now. Wouldn't want to break post-mission protocol, right Colonel?"
0,22,7,JANET,"Sorry to have to do this. Right, open. You had a sore throat lately?"
0,22,7,SAM,"A little, why?"
0,22,7,JANET,There's a small abrasion back there. I have to do a swab. And open. Cassandra's been asking about you.
0,22,7,SAM,"Cassandra, yeah, I've been so busy lately."
0,22,7,JANET,She understands. Okay! You just let me know if it gets worse.
0,22,7,SAM,"I'm free to go out tomorrow, though, right? We're searching for possible relocation sites for the Nasyians."
0,22,7,JANET,"Sure! Cassandra's gonna be at the hospital with me tomorrow, so why don't you stop by and spend a little time with her first, you know, if you can."
0,22,7,SAM,I will.
0,22,7,JANET,Good.
0,22,9,JANET,Patient has third degree burns to over 80% of his body. So far no signs of infection. Incredible.
0,22,10,JANET,Hey.
0,22,10,SAM,Is this one of the Nasyians we saved?
0,22,10,JANET,"Yeah, he should be dead. Cassandra is in my office, now I still have rounds to make, but you know where it is?"
0,22,10,SAM,Right.
0,22,12,SAM,Hey there.
0,22,12,CASSIE,Sam!
0,22,13,CASSIE,You really like it? My teacher at school says I have talent.
0,22,13,SAM,I love it.
0,22,13,CASSIE,I missed you.
0,22,13,SAM,"I know, I've sorry, I've been so busy."
0,22,13,CASSIE,Very busy.
0,22,14,SAM,"Cassandra, what is it?"
0,22,16,HAMMOND,It would be earier on the Nasyians if there were already an active civilisation willing to co-operate.
0,22,16,JACK,I'll bet you the folks on P3X-422 would be willing.
0,22,16,TECH,"Colonel O'Neill, there's an urgent call for you, Sir."
0,22,16,JACK,Check.
0,22,17,JANET,Thanks for coming so quickly.
0,22,17,JACK,What's going on with her?
0,22,17,JANET,"I'm not sure, she won't talk to me. She said she'd see you and only you. Cassandra, it's just me honey, I've got Colonel O'Neill with me."
0,22,18,JACK,Hey. Janet says you've been a little upset since Sam was here. What happened?
0,22,18,CASSIE,She said she'd kill me if I told.
0,22,18,JACK,"Well, you don't mean kill you kill you."
0,22,19,JACK,"No, I doubt that."
0,22,19,CASSSANDRA,She said she would.
0,22,19,JACK,"Cass, Sam loves you, she'd never do anything to hurt you."
0,22,19,CASSSANDRA,She would now.
0,22,19,JACK,Why?
0,22,19,CASSSANDRA,She's a Goa'uld.
0,22,20,SAM,Where's the Colonel? We're due to get out of here in five minutes!
0,22,20,DANIEL,"Well he left us a message, said he'd meet us in the Gate Room."
0,22,20,SAM,Well step on it then!
0,22,20,DANIEL,What was that?
0,22,21,SAM,Where's Colonel O'Neill?
0,22,22,JACK,"Stand down campers, we're on a hold."
0,22,22,SAM,Why?
0,22,22,JACK,"I dunno, some computer glitch."
0,22,23,SAM,What the hell was that?
0,22,24,JANET,That was enough to take down an elephant!
0,22,25,JOLINAR,Open the Stargate!
0,22,25,DANIEL,"Jack, what the hell is going on?"
0,22,25,JOLINAR,Open the gate now! I command you!
0,22,25,JOLINAR,Open the gate now or we will all die!
0,22,26,JACK,Hold your fire!Teal'c!
0,22,26,AIRMAN,"I have a shot, sir."
0,22,26,JACK,"And if she drops that grenade, what? Nobody's gonna open that Stargate. We're all gonna live, or we're all gonna die, right here."
0,22,26,JOLINAR,Let me go! I must go!
0,22,26,JACK,Not gonna happen.
0,22,27,JACK,Take it easy.
0,22,28,JACK,I didn't know. I wasn't sure until I saw her lose it down there. Cassie was the one who suspected.
0,22,28,JANET,"Cassandra still has traces of naqahdah in her blood. I think there may be some connection, a reaction that made her sense the Goa'uld."
0,22,28,HAMMOND,How in the world did it get into Captain Carter?
0,22,28,JANET,"Sir, I don't know what to say. I examined Captain Carter myself, there were no visible signs of entry. I mean, she had a small abrasion on the back of her throat, but it could have been anything!"
0,22,28,HAMMOND,Are you saying it entered through her mouth?
0,22,28,JANET,The parasite's goal is to attach itself to the brain stem. The soft tissue at the back of the throat is as good a place as any to start.
0,22,28,JACK,"Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute. Oh my God, she was giving some guy on that planet mouth to mouth. There was blood but she said the guy just bit his tongue before he died."
0,22,28,JANET,"If a Goa'uld can infest a human with no detectable physical signs, then we're gonna have to start giving all personnel who go through the 'gate an ultrasound or an MRI."
0,22,28,HAMMOND,Well for now let's make sure we haven't let any more Goa'ulds through the 'gate this time.
0,22,28,DANIEL,"What would a Goa'uld be doing in a Nasyian man in the first place? I mean, we certainly didn't notice any of them acting Goa'uldish."
0,22,28,JACK,"Maybe it was a set-up, trying to get a spy into one of us."
0,22,28,TEAL'C,It is possible the Goa'uld within Captain Carter has already placed a device of destuction on this base.
0,22,28,HAMMOND,"If there's any tampering here, I want it found. Teal'c, I'd like you to help. You know better than anyone what to look for."
0,22,28,DANIEL,"Oh, what are we going to do about Sam?"
0,22,28,JACK,We're gonna get that damn thing out of her is what we're gonna do!
0,22,28,DANIEL,"Well that didn't really work with Kawalsky. And if any of those NID guys like Colonel Maybourne find out about this, then..."
0,22,28,JACK,"Well they're not going to! Right, General?"
0,22,28,HAMMOND,"Agreed. I'm not giving up on Captain Carter either. But until someone presents me with a viable option, I'm putting you in charge of interrogating the prisoner."
0,22,28,JACK,"Due respect Sir, I don't think that thing in her head's going to tell me anything."
0,22,28,HAMMOND,"Colonel, we need to know what that Goa'uld's doing here."
0,22,28,JACK,Yes sir.
0,22,29,DOCTOR JACOBS,"Sorry to bother you. Just a quick test here. Okay now, we're gonna have to get rid of some of those bandages."
0,22,31,DANIEL,"Oh, excuse me."
0,22,31,TALIA,Your world is an amazing place.
0,22,31,DANIEL,It can be. I'm Daniel.
0,22,31,TALIA,You are one of the men responsible for saving us.
0,22,31,DANIEL,Yeah.
0,22,31,TALIA,We owe you great thanks.
0,22,31,DANIEL,Can we talk a minute?
0,22,32,TEAL'C,Colonel O'Neill.
0,22,32,JACK,Thought you were helping with the sweep of the base?
0,22,32,TEAL'C,I am on my way. This is difficult.
0,22,32,JACK,"Yeah. Yeah, it is."
0,22,32,TEAL'C,Assault the Goa'uld's ego. Make him appear foolish. He may then reveal the things you wish to learn simply to make himself appear more powerful.
0,22,32,JACK,Come on Teal'c. They're smarter than that.
0,22,32,TEAL'C,I have seen many Goa'uld strategies revealed and certain victories lost because of Goa'uld arrogance. It is the Goa'uld's greatest weakness.
0,22,32,JACK,Yeah.
0,22,32,TEAL'C,"Colonel O'Neill. When you speak to her, do not see your friend."
0,22,32,JACK,How do you do that?
0,22,33,JACK,"So, you and I have got to have a little talk. You really screwed up here you know. I mean, you really blew it."
0,22,33,JOLINAR,You are weak.
0,22,33,JACK,Who's behind bars right now?
0,22,33,JOLINAR,Your tactics will not work on me.
0,22,33,JACK,"Not buying it, huh?"
0,22,33,JOLINAR,You must let me go.
0,22,33,JACK,"Ah, no."
0,22,33,JOLINAR,You really have no idea why this is happening.
0,22,33,JACK,And I guess you don't feel like telling me.
0,22,34,DANIEL,This is a picture of the man the Goa'uld came from.
0,22,34,TALIA,It's my husband.
0,22,34,DANIEL,"One of the other Nasyians recognised him, and we found this in our video archive."
0,22,34,TALIA,Then something was inside of him?
0,22,34,DANIEL,I know how difficult this is for you. I lost my wife to the Goa'uld.
0,22,34,TALIA,I'm sorry.
0,22,34,DANIEL,"It's important that you tell me if you noticed anything different about your husband lately. I mean, anything, an injury, uh, new scars, maybe a..."
0,22,34,TALIA,"Wait, here. But it was months ago."
0,22,34,DANIEL,"Months ago? You never noticed anything since then? I mean, he wasn't acting strange? I mean was it violent, I mean his eyes didn't glow? I'm sorry."
0,22,34,DANIEL,Why don't I let you rest?
0,22,36,JOLINAR,Let me go. Let me go through the Stargate. I will find another host and send your friend back to you.
0,22,36,JACK,You can do that? Leave a host without killing them?
0,22,36,JOLINAR,"Yes. It is possible, but not easy. I could die, but I promise I will try."
0,22,36,JACK,The Nasyian man died when you left him.
0,22,36,JOLINAR,"The Nasyian man died first, that is why I left him. He was beyond my natural abilities to heal."
0,22,36,JACK,What were you doing in him in the first place?
0,22,36,JOLINAR,Carter's mind would be intact. She would return to you as you knew her before.
0,22,36,JACK,You know I can't trust you.
0,22,36,JOLINAR,I could have killed you and many others when you stopped me from going through the Stargate.
0,22,36,JACK,You didn't want to die yourself.
0,22,36,JOLINAR,It would not have killed me. I am too valuable.
0,22,36,JACK,Which is exactly why we'll never let you go.
0,22,36,JOLINAR,I have done nothing to harm you. But you would not let me go even if you did believe me.
0,22,37,SAMEDIC 2,"Oh God, he's telling you the truth! Please, Jack, no Jack, please, don't leave me, please, give me a chance! Don't leave me like this! Please!"
0,22,38,JOLINAR,What will it take?
0,22,39,TEAL'C,You have requested my presence?
0,22,39,JOLINAR,"Jaffa, you must convince the humans to let me go."
0,22,39,TEAL'C,They will not let you go.
0,22,39,JOLINAR,They are impressive. The Tau'ri have become very powerful in the time since the Goa'uld reign here. Certainly the System Lords will not allow this to go unchecked. I can provide the humans with information that can help them defend against attack.
0,22,39,TEAL'C,They are more powerful than you know. Already a Goa'uld attack on Earth has been thwarted.
0,22,39,JOLINAR,Then a more powerful assault is already being planned.
0,22,39,TEAL'C,They are not fools. They believe you are here to plant a seed of that destruction.
0,22,39,JOLINAR,Not all Goa'uld are the same. There are a few that oppose the System Lords and their ways. You must have heard of the Tok'ra.
0,22,39,TEAL'C,Every Goa'uld seeks power for his own reason and would betray his own brother to achieve it.
0,22,39,JOLINAR,"Some seek power for a greater purpose. Not every Goa'uld is an enemy to the people of this planet. The Tok'ra are real, no matter what Apophis has told you."
0,22,39,TEAL'C,I have yet to meet one.
0,22,39,JOLINAR,You have now. I am Jolinar of Malkshur.
0,22,40,DANIEL,"Oh, er, excuse me, I just wanted to check on Talia. How is she?"
0,22,40,ASHRAK,She's good.
0,22,41,JANET,"Peter, have you seen Doctor Jacobs recently?"
0,22,41,PETER,Uh-uh.
0,22,41,JANET,What about the most recent bloodwork done on the patient in 412?
0,22,41,PETER,Here it is.
0,22,41,JANET,"Good, thanks."
0,22,42,JANET,Doctor Jacobs!
0,22,43,TEAL'C,"There is an old legend among the Jaffa for them to speak of concerning a group of Goa'uld who opposed the ways of the System Lords. This group is called the Tok'ra. This Goa'uld, Jolinar of Malkshur, claims to be part of that group."
0,22,43,JACK,Can you be sure he is who he says he is?
0,22,43,TEAL'C,I cannot.
0,22,43,JOLINAR,Unfortunately we do not carry identification.
0,22,43,JACK,"Okay, lets try to build a little trust here, shall we? One of the Nasyians we brought back was very badly burned. But somehow he just got up out of his hospital bed and disappeared. Who is he?"
0,22,43,JOLINAR,It must be the Ashrak.
0,22,43,TEAL'C,It means hunter.
0,22,43,JACK,A Goa'uld?
0,22,43,JOLINAR,Yes. An assassin of the highest rank who carries out the orders of the System Lords.
0,22,43,JACK,Who's he here to kill?
0,22,43,JOLINAR,Me.
0,22,44,TEAL'C,The missing Nasyian is an Ashrak. A Goa'uld assassin sent by the System Lords to eliminate Jolinar.
0,22,44,DANIEL,That's the name of the Goa'uld in Sam.
0,22,44,TEAL'C,It is. Jolinar once tried to overthrow one of the System Lords but was defeated when Apophis joined the battle. He escaped during the slaughter of his armies.
0,22,44,JACK,It seems this Jolinar is wanted in Goa'uld town.
0,22,44,TEAL'C,He claims to be part of the Tok'ra.
0,22,44,DANIEL,Resistance.
0,22,44,TEAL'C,The Tok'ra is a small alliance of Goa'uld who oppose the System Lords. It was my teacher Bra'tac who first spoke to me of them.
0,22,44,HAMMOND,"Well, this Goa'uld inside Carter could be lying, spinning a tale to gain our trust."
0,22,44,JACK,It's quite a spin.
0,22,44,HAMMOND,The sweep of the base has turned up no evidence. There's been no tampering with the base computer. We can't find a single sign of sabotage.
0,22,44,DANIEL,Well that's why Jolinar didn't reveal himself to be a Goa'uld! He was actually hiding out in the Nasyian man.
0,22,44,TEAL'C,Until he was hunted down by the Ashrak. When he realised we may have helped him escape through the Stargate.
0,22,44,HAMMOND,He improvised. So where are we?
0,22,44,JACK,Bottom line sir? We may have a Goa'uld out there who's on a mission to kill Carter.
0,22,44,DANIEL,And we don't even know what he looks like.
0,22,45,ASHRAK,Excuse me.
0,22,45,AIRMAN,"Yeah Doc, what's up?"
0,22,45,ASHRAK,Are you sending these people home?
0,22,45,AIRMAN,"Yeah, you could say that."
0,22,46,JOLINAR,Daniel Jackson.
0,22,46,DANIEL,Yes.
0,22,46,JOLINAR,You care about Samantha Carter as much as O'Neill and Teal'c.
0,22,46,DANIEL,Yes I do.
0,22,46,JOLINAR,Yet this is the first time you have come to see me.
0,22,46,DANIEL,I came to see if you could give us a description of the Ashrak.
0,22,46,JOLINAR,"I will know his face only in the moments before he tortures me to death, killing your friend along with me."
0,22,46,DANIEL,Well there's no way he's getting in here.
0,22,46,JOLINAR,"You are not stupid, Daniel, nor am I."
0,22,46,DANIEL,"He doesn't even know for sure you're on this planet, let alone in this base."
0,22,46,JOLINAR,"He is Goa'uld, he will find me. It's what he does. Letting me go, trusting me, is the only chance of saving your friend Samantha."
0,22,46,DANIEL,"Then I'm sorry, I'm sorry Sam."
0,22,46,JOLINAR,"Alive I can be a powerful ally, dead I am useless to you."
0,22,46,DANIEL,Then you're gonna have to give us more than empty promises.
0,22,46,JOLINAR,I can give her back to you.
0,22,46,DANIEL,We can't let you go.
0,22,46,JOLINAR,"I'm not talking about Samantha, Daniel, I'm talking about Sha're. I know where she is."
0,22,47,AIRMAN,Who are you?
0,22,47,ASHRAK,John Adams.
0,22,47,AIRMAN,You're not John.
0,22,48,JACK,"Daniel, it's a ploy. He's playing on your greatest weakness."
0,22,48,DANIEL,"Well that may be so, but this many be the only chance we have to see Sam again."
0,22,48,TEAL'C,I believe Jolinar speaks the truth.
0,22,48,DANIEL,"Look, he told me about this resistance. Now, they have a totally different way of life from the Goa'uld we know. They don't believe in taking hosts against their will."
0,22,48,JACK,"Right, like Carter and this Nasyian guy?"
0,22,48,DANIEL,"No, he had no choice. He wants to leave Carter."
0,22,48,HAMMOND,"But if they don't believe in taking hosts, how do they survive?"
0,22,48,DANIEL,They take humans who are about to die. Who choose to continue to live and co-exist with the Goa'uld. Now according to Jolinar this can be a rewarding relationship.
0,22,48,JACK,"Daniel, I'm sorry, I know what this means to you. But I will never, never trust a Goa'uld."
0,22,49,HAMMOND,Hammond. The first group of Nasyians from the hospital have arrived.
0,22,50,AIRMAN,Go ahead soldier. What the hell's that thing?
0,22,51,ASHRAK,It's a ring. Want a closer look?
0,22,52,AIRMAN,"Have a nice day, airman."
0,22,53,ASHRAK,"Boys, as you were."
0,22,55,DANIEL,"There's really no need to worry, there will be a team waiting for you on the other side."
0,22,55,TECH,Chevron one encoded.
0,22,56,TECH,Chevron five is engaged.
0,22,56,HAMMOND,Thankyou.
0,22,57,HAMMOND,The driver of a transport truck who delivered the Nasyians just reported into the infirmary. Says he blacked out. Doesn't remember driving from the hospital to the base at all!
0,22,57,JACK,"Call up security camera one six delta, please."
0,22,58,JACK,"Teal'c, let's get down there."
0,22,58,TECH,Chevron six is engaged.
0,22,58,HAMMOND,"This is General Hammond. Security to level sixteen, holding room delta."
0,22,58,TECH,Chevron seven is locked.
0,22,59,ASHRAK,"Interesting weapons these humans use. Kree'shak, Jolinar. By decree of the Goa'uld System Lords you will die with dishonour by the power of the Hara'kash."
0,22,59,JOLINAR,Hear this. The days of the Goa'uld System Lords are numbered. Tell them that I died with hope. My death only feeds the fire that burns strong in the Tokr'a.
0,22,60,ASHRAK,"She's dead, let's go."
0,22,61,ASHRAK,"Colonel, the prisoner and two guards, dead."
0,22,62,TEAL'C,These two are dead.
0,22,62,JACK,"Sam, Sam! Sam. Teal'c, get a medical team down here right away. Come on Sam."
0,22,64,FRASIER,"Let's get her on the table. I want an EKG and an EEG stat! Okay, on my count. Three, two, one, good. Whoa, where's my epi? 1 milligram epi's in.."
0,22,65,TALIA,"Thankyou, for everything your people have done for us."
0,22,65,DANIEL,You're gonna be okay.
0,22,65,TALIA,I hope your friend will also be well.
0,22,66,MEDIC 1,Pulse is erratic.
0,22,66,JANET,We're getting feedback from the EEG. What is this?
0,22,66,MEDIC 1,Looks like interference. Two signals.
0,22,66,JANET,Well isolate them! We could be picking up separate brain waves from the parasite.
0,22,67,DANIEL,"Hey, I know you."
0,22,67,ASHRAK,Do not try and stop me or I will kill him!
0,22,69,JACK,Doc?
0,22,69,JANET,"I dunno, I've never dealt with this type of situation before. The Goa'uld looks like it's dying and taking Carter with it."
0,22,70,HAMMOND,"Release him, and no harm will come to you."
0,22,70,ASHRAK,Turn it back on!
0,22,70,HAMMOND,We can't do that. Let him go.
0,22,70,ASHRAK,"Turn the gate back on now, or he dies!"
0,22,71,MEDIC 1,The parasite is still getting weaker.
0,22,72,MEDIC 1,Parasite energy level is still falling.
0,22,73,DANIEL,They're not gonna let you go.
0,22,73,ASHRAK,Silence! Open the Stargate!
0,22,74,JANET,Let's cardiovert one more time. 30 joules.
0,22,75,TEAL'C,I am sorry Daniel Jackson.
0,22,77,TEAL'C,Are you injured?
0,22,77,DANIEL,Dumb question. But thankyou. I think. f
0,22,77,TEAL'C,You are welcome.
0,22,77,DANIEL,Just don't ever do that again.
0,22,78,MEDIC 2,The parasite is dead.
0,22,78,JANET,Try another milligram of epi. Then prepare for defib.
0,22,78,MEDIC 1,She's out of defib!
0,22,78,MEDIC 2,She's got a pulse!
0,22,78,MEDIC 1,Faint but stable.
0,22,79,JACK,"You did it Sam, you won."
0,22,79,SAM,It wasn't me.
0,22,79,JACK,"Oh yes it was. You hung in there, you beat it."
0,22,79,SAM,The Goa'uld gave its life for me. It saved me.
0,22,80,DANIEL,"Hey Sam, how's it going tonight?"
0,22,81,DANIEL,She's still the same.
0,22,81,CASSIE,Janet said that the Goa'uld left after it died.
0,22,81,DANIEL,Well that's right. It died and her body's absorbing it. She's the same old Samantha Carter. Same person we've always known.
0,22,81,JACK,"Cassie, she's just a little sad right now. But I'll bet she cheers up when she sees you."
0,22,82,CASSIE,"Sam, it's me. You're going to be okay."
