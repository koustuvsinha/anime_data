0,23,0,"""PRISONERS""",By Terry Curtis Fox The team are offworld on a planet that consists of lush green forestry
0,23,0,JACK,"All right kids. Were due back, unless you can tell me youve discovered something Earth shattering, Im read to bag this one."
0,23,0,DANIEL,We practically just got here. We have no idea what this planet has to offer.
0,23,0,JACK,Trees and Moss.
0,23,0,DANIEL,"Well, a few miles from the Stargate, granted, but..."
0,23,0,JACK,Captain any signs of radio traffic in the last twenty-four hours? Any chemical traces in the air to indicate civilization?
0,23,0,SAM,"None, sir."
0,23,1,JACK,Ah! Ah! Well flag it for an aerial survey. As much as I love a good rain forest..
0,23,1,TEAL'C,ONeill
0,23,2,MAN,Help me. They find me. Taldor.
0,23,2,JACK,Who?
0,23,2,MAN,Taldor. They find me now.
0,23,2,JACK,Daniel?
0,23,2,DANIEL,"Tal? I dont, I have no idea."
0,23,2,MAN,They find me. They find you.
0,23,2,DANIEL,Taldor is bad?
0,23,2,MAN,All around us now.
0,23,2,JACK,"All right, all right. Were surrounded by Taldor. Just relax. Just come with us. Come on. All right,Keep an eye out for Taldor."
0,23,3,MAN,Taldor.
0,23,3,JACK,What the hell is that?
0,23,3,MAN,It comes for us.
0,23,3,JACK,What?
0,23,4,JACK,Everybody all right?
0,23,4,TALDOR,You are prisoners
0,23,4,DANIEL,Taldor! Taldor means justice. It just came to me.
0,23,4,MALE TALDOR,You trespass on ancient grounds.
0,23,4,JACK,"Hey, look we didnt mean to trespass. Were explorers, we came through the Stargate from Earth."
0,23,4,TALDOR,It does not matter who you are or where you are from; you have helped..
0,23,4,JACK,Who? This guy? Yeah?
0,23,4,MALE TALDOR,Then you share in his crime.
0,23,4,JACK,What crime?
0,23,4,TALDOR,Murder.
0,23,4,JACK,"All right, look. We dont know anything about a murder. He was running from something, he stopped for help. We helped."
0,23,4,MALE TALDOR,For the crimes of trespass on ancient grounds...
0,23,4,JACK,Anybody wanna to jump in here?
0,23,4,TALDOR,Of aiding a murder
0,23,4,DANIEL,We had no intention of interfering with your justice system
0,23,4,MALE TALDOR,Of carrying weapon on ancient grounds
0,23,4,SAM,We are trained to defend ourselves.
0,23,4,TALDOR,You will be sent through the Stargate
0,23,4,DANIEL,Thank you
0,23,4,MALE TALDOR,To The prison Hadante.
0,23,4,JACK,"Oh, No, no no no This is just a misunderstanding."
0,23,4,TALDOR,For the remainder of you lives.
0,23,6,JACK,Hey! Well this sucks.
0,23,7,DANIEL,Why are they whistling?
0,23,7,TEAL'C,ONeill.
0,23,8,SAM,Oh my God.
0,23,8,JACK,What?
0,23,8,TEAL'C,The wounds are cauterised.
0,23,8,JACK,Yeah? So?
0,23,8,SAM,"So, who ever it was must have been standing in front of the gate when it opened. Disintegrated by the vortex."
0,23,8,DANIEL,Why would anyone do that?
0,23,8,SAM,It's okay. We aren't going to hurt you. We just want to talk to you. Please
0,23,8,TEAL'C,Captain Carter
0,23,9,LINEA,Vishnor.
0,23,10,LINEA,You have been sent through the great circle
0,23,10,DANIEL,"Well, yes but that was."
0,23,10,LINEA,You have been sentenced to life imprisonment here for your crimes or you would not be here. I am Linea.
0,23,10,DANIEL,"Well, I am Daniel; This is Jack, Captain Carter and Tealc. If youre the one that stopped this attack,then I suppose we are grateful."
0,23,11,LINEA,This woman is under my protection. She is not to be taken by any man.
0,23,11,SAM,"Its alright, its..."
0,23,11,LINEA,Is that clear Vishnor? Is that clear?
0,23,12,LINEA,You were saying?
0,23,12,SAM,"Ah, that I can take care of myself."
0,23,12,LINEA,"I mean you no disrespect. But I know what it is to be a woman in Hadante. For what little it is worth, welcome."
0,23,12,DANIEL,"Oh, ah, excuse me but..."
0,23,12,JACK,"Daniel, I think thats about it for the welcome wagon.You alright?"
0,23,12,SAM,Yes sir.
0,23,12,JACK,Okay kids. This is our situation. What do we need?
0,23,12,DANIEL,A dial home device would be nice.
0,23,12,JACK,"Okay, lets assume we dont find one of those. What else?"
0,23,12,SAM,Power To free up the super conductive ring on the stargate.
0,23,12,TEAL'C,So we can dial the gate manually.
0,23,12,SAM,Its worked before.
0,23,12,JACK,"Right. So we're looking for a power source. Tealc, look scary, take point."
0,23,13,JACK,We're with him.
0,23,13,DANIEL,Its like were in Botany Bay.
0,23,13,JACK,What?
0,23,13,DANIEL,"Oh, The original name for Sydney Harbour. When the British first colonized Australia they turned into a continental prison that was half a world away. Of course this is probably more than that."
0,23,14,JACK,"Its okay, its okay."
0,23,14,TEAL'C,Perhaps the Taldor only believes the stargate goes here.
0,23,14,SAM,Wherever here is.
0,23,15,PRISONER,Here. I give.
0,23,15,DANIEL,What you killed him?
0,23,15,PRISONER,No not me. Killed himself. Not me.
0,23,15,JACK,Right
0,23,15,PRISONER,Here for you.
0,23,16,SAM,In exchange for?
0,23,16,PRISONER,"Like Linea, a gift. For the protected one."
0,23,17,PRISONER,You are very strong. Yes?
0,23,17,TEAL'C,Yes. I am.
0,23,17,PRISONER,Maybe you challenge Vishnor? Maybe you win. Maybe I be your friend.
0,23,17,TEAL'C,Maybe not.
0,23,17,JACK,"Okay. Daniel, you and Tealc keep looking around Botany Bay here. Carter and I are going to have a little chat with...."
0,23,17,SAM,Linea.
0,23,17,JACK,"Right. Something is generating the power around here, and she seems to be in charge."
0,23,18,JACK,Oh Danny! You've got to trust me on this
0,23,19,JACK,"Signs of weakness, not a good thing in prison."
0,23,20,SAM,"You know, sir, without our remote transmitter."
0,23,20,JACK,I know. General Hammond will send another SG team as soon as we are overdue.
0,23,21,SAM,What do you think they're going to do to him?
0,23,21,JACK,"Not our problem, Captain."
0,23,22,TECH,"We're getting SG3's remote Transmitter, sir."
0,23,22,HAMMOND,Lets hope they found SG1. Open the iris. Have them report directly to the briefing room.
0,23,22,TECH,yes sir.
0,23,23,LINEA,"Sooner or later, all new arrivals come here. Youre not from any of the island states under the Taldor."
0,23,23,JACK,"No we're from Earth. Earth is, well, its way out there."
0,23,23,LINEA,Then youre from a place from which I have no knowledge. Do you intend to challenge me?
0,23,23,JACK,"Well, all we really want to do, right now, is get out of here."
0,23,23,LINEA,"Get out of here? We are deep under ground.It is my understanding that the great circle transported us to an entirely different world. One that once teemed with life, but no more. This place, thousands of years old, is all that remains. Thats why the Taldor turned it into a prison. They could see no other use."
0,23,23,SAM,"So, bottom line is the stargate is the only way in or out."
0,23,23,LINEA,"Many here believe that when a prisoner comes through the stargate , they can be caught in the circles great wave and returned to the other side."
0,23,23,JACK,Actually they die.
0,23,23,SAM,See what you just referred to as the great wave is actually an unstable vortex generated by the gate when it first opens. Anything inside its radius is completely designated.
0,23,23,JACK,Theres a pair of smoking feet standing in place when we got here.
0,23,23,LINEA,"There are two ways and two ways only to control a society. Through fear or through hope. In this world, fear is a constant. The belief in escape, whether founded or not, allows hope."
0,23,23,JACK,"So out of hope, these people are killing themselves?"
0,23,23,LINEA,"They believe it is escape, who am I to say it is not."
0,23,23,JACK,"Well, we have a better way."
0,23,23,LINEA,What would you ask of me?
0,23,23,SAM,We need power.
0,23,23,LINEA,"There are many forms of power, my dear. Some more subtle than others."
0,23,23,JACK,"For the moment, we just need is the electrical kind."
0,23,23,LINEA,Then we both have something the other wants.
0,23,24,HAMMOND,They just handed you SG1s weapons and remote transmitters and offered no further explanation?
0,23,24,WARREN,Only that they have been accused of a crime and sent through the stargate to some sort of prison.
0,23,24,HAMMOND,What crime?
0,23,24,WARREN,They said it wasnt my concern and sent me straight to the stargate. I was going to take my men back and --
0,23,24,HAMMOND,"You did the right thing returning to base. From what you tell me, this has become a diplomatic problem. That means"
0,23,25,LINEA,Ive long believed that the best way to get knowledge is to give it. These are my activators.
0,23,26,SAM,Is this a chemical reaction?
0,23,26,LINEA,Much more.The liquid permeates the hard core of the terra-root and allows for the organic material within to interact on a basic level.
0,23,26,JACK,Basic? Meaning?
0,23,26,LINEA,"That which we cannot see, but which all is made."
0,23,26,SAM,Subatomic.
0,23,26,JACK,Ah.
0,23,26,SAM,Are we talking about organically based cold fusion?
0,23,26,LINEA,I do not know your terminology.
0,23,26,SAM,"What you call basics, we call atoms. Groups of protons, neutrons, and electrons. These are the basic building blocks of all matter."
0,23,26,LINEA,"My activators spirit these materials to combine within the cells of the terra-root. When new material is made energy is released, flowing through the tendrils of the plant."
0,23,26,SAM,"Colonel, thats cold fusion. Whatever organic material the roots are made of serves as a catalyzes causing the atoms of her chemicals to fuse together. If we had this on Earth wed practically eliminate pollution."
0,23,26,JACK,Captain. Back To Basics. Will it power the stargate?
0,23,26,SAM,It might.
0,23,26,LINEA,Activate the great circle from this side? The permutations number in the billions. Its incalculable.
0,23,26,JACK,"Well, actually, she figured it out."
0,23,26,LINEA,You?
0,23,26,SAM,"It was a team effort, really."
0,23,26,LINEA,How?
0,23,26,SAM,"Ah, well."
0,23,26,JACK,"Tell you what, provide the power we need, and well take you with us."
0,23,26,LINEA,Only then you will share the knowledge.
0,23,26,JACK,Thats the deal.
0,23,27,DANIEL,Tealc I think hes had enough.
0,23,27,TEAL'C,"If you once again try to physically harm myself, or any of my companions, my patience with you will expire."
0,23,28,JACK,"Well, Tealc, making friends, are ya?"
0,23,28,TEAL'C,Found nothing of use.
0,23,28,DANIEL,"Although I am sure this structure is the ruins of some sort of alien gate terminal. Its over 50,000 years old. That almost certain to pre-date human civilization. Which is not of any use, per se"
0,23,28,JACK,We may have found what we need.
0,23,28,SAM,Linea has a power source. And just not any power source either; this is incredible.
0,23,28,DANIEL,And shes just going to hand it over?
0,23,28,JACK,If we take her back with us.
0,23,28,DANIEL,Well can we just do that? We dont even know what shes in here for.
0,23,28,SAM,What are we in here for?
0,23,28,JACK,"Jaywalking, I think"
0,23,28,TEAL'C,"Clearly, Linea has done something to earn the respect of these prisoners."
0,23,28,DANIEL,"Well, when she warned that man to stay way from Sam, I saw fear in his eyes. Not respect."
0,23,28,JACK,Im just going to assume youve never been in prison before.
0,23,28,DANIEL,"Oh, right, and you have"
0,23,28,JACK,"Oh yeah. Any place like this has its own set of rules, and they dont have to make sense. Linea has obviously done what ever shes needed to do to survive. Just like we are.Speaking of which?"
0,23,28,SAM,"Well, Colonel, were talking about powering one completely alien device with another. I mean, its not like splicing together a few wires."
0,23,28,JACK,Ill take that as a maybe?
0,23,28,TEAL'C,"Without our remote transmitters, we still have no access to Earth. The iris will be closed."
0,23,28,JACK,"Okay Daniel, you know more addresses than any of us, start thinking of one."
0,23,29,SAM,Incoming.
0,23,31,VISHNOR,You eat last.
0,23,32,LINEA,Thank you Vishnor
0,23,34,KOVACEK,"Sir, SG1 broke the law on P3X-775. We dont have to agree with their law, but we may have to respect it."
0,23,34,HAMMOND,Sounds like to me they just made an honest mistake.
0,23,34,KOVACEK,"We tried to explain that sir. On our world unknowingly abetting a criminal doesnt merit this kind of punishment. However the Taldor, they are the judicial body, they believe in zero tolerance, almost religiously. No appeals process, essiensually one sentence, life imprisonment for nearly all offenses."
0,23,34,HAMMOND,That doesnt sound like justice to me.
0,23,34,KOVACEK,"Perhaps not sir, but the fact is, they have virtually no crime. Just crimes of passion, sometimes the occasional sociopath."
0,23,34,WARREN,"General, sir, SG-3 is prepared to go after.."
0,23,34,KOVACEK,"No sir, with all due respect, force isnt the answer. They are far more technologically advanced than we are. We couldnt possible succeed in extracting SG-1, and wed just be making an enemy."
0,23,34,WARREN,Theyve already made an enemy.
0,23,34,KOVACEK,"No. I disagree. Sir, they are open to relations with us. In fact next time, several members of the Taldor are going to allow us see their faces."
0,23,34,WARREN,"Sir, This is nuts. Let my team go back."
0,23,34,HAMMOND,"Major, as of 0800 tomorrow, your unit is scheduled to standard recon of P2A-509. I expect you to be ready to carry out your mission."
0,23,34,WARREN,Yes sir.
0,23,35,LINEA,I treat it before ingesting. Its quite better than what you scrapped from the bottom of the barrel.
0,23,35,SAM,"Ah, Thank you. Actually I came to ask you something."
0,23,35,LINEA,My crime?
0,23,35,SAM,Yeah.
0,23,35,LINEA,There was an experiment with tragic consequences. People died.
0,23,35,SAM,How many people?
0,23,35,LINEA,"Thousands. It began with a terrible plague among the people who sent you here. Time was short; I offered my knowledge. Instead of inhibiting the diseases progress, my medicine accelerated its effects."
0,23,35,SAM,And they blamed you.
0,23,35,LINEA,Yes.
0,23,35,SAM,Im not surprised. We didnt deserve this either.
0,23,35,LINEA,Do not think that I am innocent.
0,23,35,SAM,What your saying is that you take responsibility for you actions?
0,23,35,LINEA,Yes. I have decided to accept your offer.
0,23,35,SAM,Great. Ill tell the colonel.
0,23,35,LINEA,You have altered the balance of power here. I have no choice.
0,23,35,SAM,"Im sorry, I dont understand."
0,23,35,LINEA,Its only a matter of time before Vishnor and his followers challenge your friends.
0,23,35,SAM,Ill warn them. Thank you.
0,23,35,LINEA,"Tell them also, that if they fail they will not live to try again."
0,23,35,SAM,Okay.
0,23,36,KOVACEK,"We better hurry, sir. the Taldor believe punctuality is emblematic as civilized behavior."
0,23,36,HAMMOND,"They do, do they?"
0,23,36,KOVACEK,"Well be transported almost immediately to upon our arrive to their tall, or speaking area. Once there, the Taldor may or may not be willing to show you their actual face."
0,23,36,HAMMOND,Whys that?
0,23,36,KOVACEK,"To put it politely, sir. Theyre xenophobic, to put it frankly, their arrogant, narrow minded, self centered..."
0,23,36,HAMMOND,I get the picture.
0,23,36,KOVACEK,But they do seem to want to maintain diplomatic contact.
0,23,36,TECH,Special envoy may embark when ready.
0,23,36,HAMMOND,"Well, here goes."
0,23,36,KOVACEK,"Since this is your first time, sir. A quick word of advice its better to exhale just before crossing the event horizon, ones instinct is to inhale immediately upon arriving on the other side. Also.."
0,23,36,HAMMOND,I think Ill figure it out on the way. Youre sure they dialed the correct address?
0,23,36,KOVACEK,Yes sir.
0,23,36,HAMMOND,The things I do for these people.
0,23,37,DANIEL,"So, Semeryia is out, and so is Chulack."
0,23,37,JACK,Captain?
0,23,37,SAM,She says shell give us power as long as we take her with us.
0,23,37,JACK,"Well, thats fine, but we still need a destination."
0,23,37,DANIEL,"Okay, well, P3A-707 might work, but its no telling how long wed be there before"
0,23,38,JACK,For crying out loud. Lets go.
0,23,39,DANIEL,Whats going on?
0,23,39,SAM,They think its away to escape.
0,23,39,DANIEL,
0,23,39,JACK,Daniel!
0,23,40,DANIEL,Look this wont save you.
0,23,40,JACK,"Daniel, get out of there!"
0,23,40,DANIEL,"You wont escape, youll die."
0,23,40,PRISONER,Out of my way!
0,23,41,VISHNOR,How dare you interfere.
0,23,41,DANIEL,I was trying to save those mens lives. Theyre dead now. They havent escaped anywhere. Theyre dead.
0,23,41,LINEA,Vishnor. Leave him.
0,23,41,VISHNOR,He challenges me. I accept.
0,23,41,DANIEL,How can you let this happened? Roacher just threw his life away.
0,23,41,LINEA,It was his life. The rules are the rules. Even I must obey them.
0,23,42,SAM,Linea you can stop this.
0,23,42,LINEA,I told you this was going to happen.
0,23,42,TEALC! TEALC!,
0,23,43,SAM,Hes still alive. Just barely.
0,23,44,TALDOR,You are most punctual.
0,23,44,KOVACEK,Thank you.
0,23,44,MALE TALDOR,You are the one called General Hammond?
0,23,44,HAMMOND,Yes. I am responsible for those people you have imprisoned.
0,23,44,KOVACEK,"Ah, by the use of the word responsible the general is in no way assuming accountability for the actions of SG1. Begging your pardon sir, but I dont want you to end up in prison along with them."
0,23,44,HAMMOND,"On the contrary, I would gladly hold myself responsible for them. I ordered them to this world in the first place."
0,23,44,TALDOR,Is this an emission of guilt?
0,23,44,KOVACEK,No
0,23,44,HAMMOND,"Yes it is. As a matter of fact, if you would allow me to take the place of"
0,23,44,MALE TALDOR,You aided a murderer?
0,23,44,HAMMOND,No.
0,23,44,TALDOR,Not guilty.
0,23,44,MALE TALDOR,Not guilty.
0,23,44,TALDOR,The assumption of guilt by proxy is rejected.
0,23,44,HAMMOND,"If my people are not released, the imprisonment of SG1 will be considered a hostile act. Peaceful relations between our two worlds will end, right here, right now."
0,23,44,MALE TALDOR,Our law is mutable.
0,23,44,HAMMOND,Your law is unjust.
0,23,44,KOVACEK,"Sir, Im not sure."
0,23,44,HAMMOND,Whats it going to be?
0,23,44,TALDOR,Release is impossible.
0,23,44,HAMMOND,Why?
0,23,44,MALE TALDOR,There are no returns from Hadante. For anyone.
0,23,45,LINEA,There. I have done what I can.
0,23,45,SAM,I dont understand what happened.
0,23,45,LINEA,Your friend prevailed.
0,23,46,LINEA,What is your name?
0,23,46,SIMIAN,"Simian. I took food. I was hungry, starving. They sent me here."
0,23,46,LINEA,Hold still.
0,23,46,SAM,Hes blind.
0,23,46,LINEA,Yes. But not always so.
0,23,46,SIMIAN,It was taken from me a little each day.
0,23,46,LINEA,There will be pain.
0,23,47,LINEA,His eyes now see.
0,23,47,JACK,You're welcome.
0,23,47,TEAL'C,He does not see grateful
0,23,47,DANIEL,aghh!
0,23,47,SAM,Daniel?
0,23,47,DANIEL,What happened?
0,23,47,JACK,"Well, you actually won a fight Dannyboy."
0,23,47,DANIEL,I dont particularly remember getting the upper hand.
0,23,47,SAM,"Neither do I, but you must have."
0,23,47,P2A-509,
0,23,47,JACK,Little brain damage along the way?
0,23,47,DANIEL,"No, SG3 was schedule to go on a mission To P2A-509. General Hammond said so in our last planning briefing. We rendezvous with SG3 and we use their remote transmitters to get home."
0,23,47,JACK,And this just came to you?
0,23,47,DANIEL,No. This came to me while I was suffocating.
0,23,47,JACK,"Then P2A-509 it is. Linea? Do they send food, and Ill use that term loosely. Does it come through gate on a regular basis?"
0,23,47,LINEA,"Everyday, at the same time."
0,23,47,JACK,Aright. Thats our window. Will that work?
0,23,47,SAM,"Power the gate, and manually dial in while the other prisoners are off eating."
0,23,48,DANIEL,What are they waiting for?
0,23,48,TEAL'C,They believe you kiledl Vishnor.
0,23,48,LINEA,You must distribute the food.
0,23,49,DANIEL,Whoa! Hey! They're first.
0,23,50,JACK,Thank you.
0,23,50,DANIEL,Okay.
0,23,51,SAM,Okay thats it.
0,23,51,JACK,Address?
0,23,52,PRISONER,Escape! Escape!
0,23,54,HAMMOND,Where in the name of heaven did you come from?
0,23,54,JACK,Prison actually. We just broke out.
0,23,54,HAMMOND,"Well how? Your remote transmitters have been returned to us. SG9 and I have spent the last two days trying to negotiate your release. With no luck, I might add."
0,23,54,DANIEL,Well actually we returned via P2A-509.
0,23,54,SAM,Daniel remembered that SG3 would be there sir. Major Warren found us and was good enough to let us borrow a transmitter to let us open the iris.
0,23,54,HAMMOND,And if I may ask?
0,23,54,JACK,"Oh, Im sorry. General Hammond, This is Linea."
0,23,54,SAM,We wouldnt have gotten out without her sir.
0,23,54,HAMMOND,"Then we owe you a great debt, maam. Welcome to the SGC."
0,23,54,LINEA,Ive never seen such a place. It seems so alien.
0,23,54,TEAL'C,"So it was with me, but over time it has become home."
0,23,54,SAM,"General Hammond, sir, with your permission Id like to offer Linea quarters here at the base. There is a great deal she has to teach us. In fact, I brought back samples of her root. With Linea's activators can generate...."
0,23,54,HAMMOND,"Ill take that into consideration Captain. In the mean time, Id like you all to report to the infirmary, including your guest. Begging your pardon maam, its merely precautionary."
0,23,54,LINEA,I would do the same thing.
0,23,54,HAMMOND,Well debrief after you all have gotten a chance to rest.
0,23,54,JACK,"Yes sir. Linea, Thank you."
0,23,55,LINEA,You spoke of a machine for storing data.
0,23,55,SAM,Right here.
0,23,55,LINEA,You have away of representing the basics?
0,23,55,SAM,Molecules and atoms. Yes. Sit down.
0,23,55,LINEA,"If I give you the basic structure of my activators, can you fabricate them?"
0,23,56,JACK,Of course that was about the time Daniel picked a fight with this big smelly guy. He actually won.
0,23,56,HAMMOND,Enter.
0,23,57,WARREN,I found him lurking near our base camp sir. I think you want to hear this.
0,23,57,JACK,General this the formerly blind man I was telling you about.
0,23,57,SIMIAN,"The first thing I see, The Destroyer of Worlds."
0,23,57,HAMMOND,Excuse me?
0,23,57,SIMIAN,"She created a sickness. The one you call Linea. She, Destroyer."
0,23,57,JACK,"Well, she told Carter there was a plague. She offered to help."
0,23,57,SIMIAN,Not help. She started it.
0,23,58,LINEA,And This stargate system spans Thousands of worlds.
0,23,58,SAM,"Theoretically, even more than that. Weve charted several hundred already, so far weve only visited a fraction of them."
0,23,58,DR GREEN,Weve discovered that most of the worlds in the network can sustain human life.
0,23,58,LINEA,Where is the repository of this knowledge?
0,23,58,SAM,"Its all in the computers, Ill show you."
0,23,58,LINEA,"Im in your debt, Samantha. This shall not be forgotten."
0,23,60,SIMIAN,"Our island states were at war, she created a sickness, one that she couldnt get herself. Terrible sickness."
0,23,60,HAMMOND,Go on.
0,23,60,SIMIAN,"Half our people died. She came, promised to save the rest. By then it had spread, island to island. By the time they had caught her, she had destroyed half a world."
0,23,62,HAMMOND,Whats going on?
0,23,62,TECH,Unauthorized gate activation.
0,23,62,HAMMOND,Abort count down. Get a team to the gate room.
0,23,62,TECH,Its sealed sir.
0,23,62,HAMMOND,Unseal it. Colonel ONeill effect the manual override.
0,23,62,DANIEL,Wheres Linea?
0,23,62,DR GREEN,"We came to, she was gone."
0,23,62,TECH,Worm hole has been activated.
0,23,62,HAMMOND,You were unconscious?
0,23,62,DR GREEN,Only for a few minutes.
0,23,62,TECH,The abort command is not responding.
0,23,63,HAMMOND,Step away from that gate. Shut it down.
0,23,63,COMPUTER,Self-destruct in 30 seconds
0,23,63,JACK,It wont take our code sir.
0,23,63,HAMMOND,Close the iris.
0,23,63,COMPUTER,Self-destruct in 20 seconds
0,23,63,HAMMOND,Try shutting the whole system down.
0,23,63,SAM,We cant sir. She got into the computer she got the coordinates. Everything.
0,23,63,9 8,
0,23,63,TECH,The codes have been erased.
0,23,63,5...,
0,23,63,SAM,It doesnt make any since.
0,23,63,4... 3... 2....1,
0,23,64,JACK,Redial those coordinates. Request permission-
0,23,64,HAMMOND,Granted.
0,23,64,TECH,The entire system just crashed.
0,23,64,JACK,"Well, get it back up!"
0,23,64,SAM,Colonel?
0,23,66,SAM,We let her out.
0,23,66,DANIEL,The Destroyer of Worlds.
