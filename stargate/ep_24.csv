0,24,0,"""THE GAMEKEEPER""",By Jonathan Glassner & Brad Wright Control Room
0,24,0,HAMMOND,This is video the MALP sent back from
0,24,0,A,Atmosphere temperature and radioactivity levels are ideal.
0,24,0,JACK,"Teal'c, this structure familiar at all?"
0,24,0,TEAL'C,It does not appear to be of Goa'uld origin.
0,24,0,DANIEL,It looks pretty advanced.
0,24,0,SAM,"It's a possible a new source of information and technology, maybe even an ally against the Goa'uld."
0,24,0,HAMMOND,"Well, it's worth a try, Colonel."
0,24,0,JACK,"Yes, Sir."
0,24,1,SAM,Well this is beautiful.
0,24,1,JACK,"Yeah, but where's there's a garden, there's snakes."
0,24,1,DANIEL,And flowers.
0,24,2,DANIEL,Way too many flowers.
0,24,3,SAM,I like what they've done with the place.
0,24,3,JACK,I'm not so sure I like what the place has done to them.
0,24,3,DANIEL,They're human.
0,24,3,TEAL'C,They are breathing.
0,24,3,JACK,"Alright, does anyone have any idea what these chambers might be?"
0,24,3,SAM,"Some kind of medical device maybe, suspended animation of some kind?"
0,24,4,SAM,"Well, this is way past our science, whatever this is."
0,24,7,TEAL'C,What is this place?
0,24,7,JACK,"Ah, I dunno, I can't put my finger on it."
0,24,7,TEAL'C,It appears to be Earth.
0,24,7,JACK,"Yeah. Teal'c, what the hell just happened to us?"
0,24,7,TEAL'C,"We were exploring PJ7-989, we entered into a large dome facility and endured some form of bodily attack."
0,24,8,JACK,Kawalsky? John?
0,24,8,JOHN,"It's Colonel. You can lower your weapon, Captain."
0,24,8,KAWALSKY,"Why you acting so spooked, Jack?"
0,24,8,JACK,Maybe because I am; you're both supposed to be dead.
0,24,8,JOHN,"That's real cute, Jack. Look, the Intel on this one is good; they keep Boris here during the day and take him underground at night, our bird confirmed on it's last fly over-no snipers, only two guards inside, it' s a piece of cake. This ain't the one you and me die on."
0,24,8,JACK,"As a matter of fact this is the one you die on. I went on this mission in 1982, East Germany, we were supposed to grab a Russian agent from that house down there, it all went bad."
0,24,8,JOHN,"You ready to move out or not, Captain?"
0,24,8,JACK,"No, no, because this isn't real, it can't be."
0,24,8,JOHN,"Oh it's real, it's very real. Your stall here is putting the rest of this unit in jeopardy, now lets move out."
0,24,8,JACK,No. Because I'm either dreaming or hallucinating.
0,24,9,JOHN,"Is that real enough for you, Jack?"
0,24,9,JACK,"Alright, how do you explain him, does he look like a member of this team?"
0,24,10,JOHN,"Thomas has been of this team longer that you have; now you get your head on straight, Captain, we are not aborting the mission this late, do you understand?"
0,24,10,JACK,What the hell is this? What the hell is going on?
0,24,10,TEAL'C,I am as perplexed as you.
0,24,10,JACK,"Teal'c, do you think is there a chance those machines we were sucked into were some kind of, I dunno, time machine or something?"
0,24,10,TEAL'C,"It is possible, the Goa'uld have experimented with time manipulation for years, perhaps another race succeeded."
0,24,10,JACK,"So, it is possible this is real?"
0,24,10,TEAL'C,You say this is a mission from your past that did not go well?
0,24,10,JACK,Yes.
0,24,10,TEAL'C,Perhaps someone has given you the opportunity to alter your history.
0,24,10,JACK,Okay.
0,24,11,JACK,Lets move out.
0,24,11,JOHN,It's about time.
0,24,12,JACK,Hold up. Lets not make the same mistake twice.
0,24,12,JOHN,What the hell are you talkin' about?
0,24,12,JACK,Sniper on the roof.
0,24,13,JOHN,"Nice catch, Jack. Lets go."
0,24,14,JOHN,Group now!
0,24,15,JACK,"Come on, John."
0,24,15,JOHN,"So much for satellite recon. Jack, take care of Barbara for me, man?"
0,24,16,JACK,Fall back!
0,24,17,JACK,Where's Kawalsky?
0,24,17,TEAL'C,He was immediately behind us.
0,24,18,JOHN,"Lower your weapon, Captain."
0,24,19,DANIEL,"Okay, what just happened?"
0,24,19,SAM,I'm not sure.
0,24,19,DANIEL,"This place looks familiar. Wait a minute, wait a minute, this is the New York Museum of Art. I've been here many times, many times."
0,24,20,MELBURN,"Okay, careful with that coverstone."
0,24,20,JAKE,"Yes, Doctor Jackson."
0,24,20,DANIEL,No...
0,24,20,SAM,Daniel?
0,24,20,WOMAN,"I'm sorry, this area isn't open to the public."
0,24,20,MELBURN,Be careful with that cover plate.
0,24,20,CLAIRE,"Jake, it's swinging a bit."
0,24,20,MELBURN,Can you bring this thing on the left a little more?
0,24,21,SAM,"Daniel, what's going on?"
0,24,21,DANIEL,"No, this can't be real."
0,24,21,SAM,Who are these people?
0,24,21,DANIEL,They're my parents.
0,24,21,MELBURN,"Move it towards the back, careful."
0,24,21,CLAIRE,Watch it on your left.
0,24,21,MELBURN,"On your left. Jake, can we bring this in, careful, bring it down, let's look at the front."
0,24,22,CLAIRE,It's swinging.
0,24,22,MELBURN,"It's okay, it's fine, we'll be fine. [ Careful."
0,24,22,DANIEL,No!
0,24,22,CLAIRE,"A bit more level, Jake."
0,24,22,MELBURN,"Okay, Jake, lets bring it down."
0,24,22,DANIEL,Get out of there mom! Get out of there dad!
0,24,24,JACK,"This is too real, every detail, all the players are here. Why should I go through this again?"
0,24,24,TEAL'C,If someone has used advanced technology to send you back to repair your history...
0,24,24,JACK,"You see, that's just it, it's history, it's over, it happened, I can't change it."
0,24,24,TEAL'C,Remaining here doing nothing will most certainly change nothing.
0,24,24,JACK,
0,24,25,JACK,"Colonel, we should check those hedges."
0,24,25,JOHN,"Negative, stick to the plan, Captain."
0,24,26,JOHN,Group now!
0,24,27,JOHN,"Jack, what are you doing?"
0,24,28,JOHN,That is not part of the plan.
0,24,29,JACK,John!
0,24,30,JACK,"Come on, John."
0,24,30,JOHN,"So much for satellite recon. Jack, take care of Barbara for me, man?"
0,24,30,JACK,Oh God. Fall back!
0,24,31,JOHN,"Lower your weapon, Captain."
0,24,31,JACK,What the hell is going on here?
0,24,31,JOHN,"What is with you, Jack? Operation East Fly is go."
0,24,31,JACK,No! You! Who are you and who are those people?
0,24,31,JOHN,"There's no-one here but us. What are you looking for a Section 8, Jack?"
0,24,32,GAMEKEEPER,"You must stop arguing and proceed with the mission. Allow me to introduce myself, I am the Keeper."
0,24,32,JACK,The keeper of what?
0,24,32,GAMEKEEPER,"The keeper of all that is around you, of all that is and all that might be."
0,24,32,TEAL'C,Why do you wish us to proceed with this mission?
0,24,32,GAMEKEEPER,Because it is that which you have always wanted.
0,24,32,JACK,"You've got to be kidding me; this was the most blown operation I' ve ever been involved with, what makes you think I wanna watch my friends be killed over and over again?"
0,24,32,GAMEKEEPER,You have always wished to do it again in order to do it differently.
0,24,32,JOHN,"We're going with or without you, Jack."
0,24,32,JACK,See ya.
0,24,32,JOHN,"Alright, have it your way."
0,24,32,GAMEKEEPER,You must go with them; it's the only way to evoke the change that you have desired for so many years.
0,24,32,JACK,I can't change the outcome if you keep changing the rules.
0,24,32,GAMEKEEPER,Do you not wish to save the lives of your friends and comrades?
0,24,32,JACK,If they were real.
0,24,32,GAMEKEEPER,"But there are so many fantastic variations that you could try, perhaps this time you could try a different route?"
0,24,32,JACK,"Sit down, Teal'c, we're not playing this game."
0,24,32,GAMEKEEPER,"Very well, have it your way."
0,24,32,TEAL'C,"I hope by doing nothing we are taking the correct action, O'Neill."
0,24,33,JACK,So do I.
0,24,34,SAM,"Daniel, I'm so sorry you had to go through that again. I've been thinking, we were pulled into those things, those machines, right? At first when we got here, I thought they were some sort of time dilation machines."
0,24,34,DANIEL,"Oh Sam, please just, just tell me that this isn't real."
0,24,34,SAM,"No, I don't think it is, it isn't consistent with any of the logical theories of time travel. For example, you should be seeing yourself here as a child or have become a child again. Daniel, I'm guessing here, but I think we're in some kind of advanced re-creation being pumped into our minds by those machines."
0,24,34,MELBURN,"Okay, careful with that coverstone."
0,24,35,WOMAN,"I'm sorry, this area isn't open to the public."
0,24,35,SAM,"Daniel, I don't think we're actually here."
0,24,35,CLAIRE,"Jake, it's swinging a bit."
0,24,35,DANIEL,No.
0,24,36,DANIEL,"Excuse me, listen to me, you have to come out of there."
0,24,36,MELBURN,"Danny, go back outside."
0,24,36,DANIEL,"Danny? No, look, look, you have to come out right now because I, because I hurt myself badly, I think I might have broken my leg, now you have to come out right now and take care of me."
0,24,36,CLAIRE,"You couldn't have hurt your leg too badly, dear, you're walking on it, okay, we'll be out in a minute, okay Sweetie?"
0,24,36,MELBURN,"Okay, Jake."
0,24,36,DANIEL,"No,No.!"
0,24,37,JAKE,"Help me with this, help me with this. Dr Jackson, Dr Jackson, can you hear me? I can't see anything. Here, help me with this. Lift it! Lift it! It's too heavy."
0,24,37,SAM,"Daniel, correct me if I'm wrong but I'll bet when this really happened, you didn't have this audience. I think that we must be in some sort of really advanced simulation, like a virtual reality. It's the only thing I can think of that could explain all this."
0,24,37,DANIEL,Oh super. So it takes one of the most tragic moments in my life and plays it over and over again.
0,24,37,SAM,"Well, maybe that's your strongest memory."
0,24,37,DANIEL,"He called me Danny like I'm, like I'm still a little kid."
0,24,37,SAM,That's probably because that's how old you were when this happened; you have taken on the role of Daniel Jackson as a child in this simulation.
0,24,37,DANIEL,You know I used to replay this over and over in my mind trying to think if there's anything I could've done to make a difference.
0,24,37,SAM,"Okay, okay, so maybe that's their point; here's your chance."
0,24,37,GAMEKEEPER,Is it not wonderful? Now you get the chance.
0,24,37,DANIEL,I beg your pardon?
0,24,37,SAM,The chance?
0,24,37,GAMEKEEPER,"The chance to relive your momentous event, to try the plethora of variations that have been weighing on your mind, to finally see if you can make a difference."
0,24,37,DANIEL,Who are you?
0,24,37,GAMEKEEPER,"Why, I am the Keeper, of course."
0,24,37,DANIEL,The keeper of..
0,24,37,GAMEKEEPER,"The keeper of all that is, was and will be in this place."
0,24,37,SAM,"Yeah, where are we exactly?"
0,24,37,GAMEKEEPER,I believe you call this place the New York Museum of Art.
0,24,37,SAM,"No, no, where are we in reality?"
0,24,37,GAMEKEEPER,"Reality is in the eye of the beholder, is it not? You have always wished to go back and do things differently. I have given you that opportunity. Now go, make things right in this place!"
0,24,37,DANIEL,"And how do I, how do I do that?"
0,24,37,GAMEKEEPER,"Well if I told you that it wouldn't be any fun, would it?"
0,24,37,DANIEL,Fun! That's what you think this is for me? Fun? Watching this happen again and again?
0,24,37,GAMEKEEPER,There would be no pleasure from the gain if there were no risk from the journey.
0,24,38,MELBURN,"Alright, careful with that coverstone."
0,24,38,JAKE,"Yes, Doctor Jackson."
0,24,39,CLAIRE,"Danny, what are you doing?"
0,24,39,DANIEL,Come on.
0,24,40,MELBURN,"Danny Jackson, you stop this right now. Jake, Jake, give me a hand here, please."
0,24,40,DANIEL,"No, No, No, No, No, No!"
0,24,40,MELBURN,Bring it in.
0,24,40,CLAIRE,A bit more level.
0,24,40,DANIEL,No!
0,24,40,MELBURN,"A little more level, bring it in."
0,24,41,DANIEL,"No! God, no. Damn you. Stop this game now!"
0,24,41,GAMEKEEPER,Whatever for? You haven't explored all your options yet.
0,24,41,DANIEL,"Well, obviously my options are infinite and my solutions are zero, now stop it. I won't play any more."
0,24,41,GAMEKEEPER,"Ah, but you will, you will."
0,24,42,MELBURN,"Alright, careful with that coverstone."
0,24,42,SAM,"Daniel, you want me to...?"
0,24,42,DANIEL,No.
0,24,42,MELBURN,"Lets bring it down, just a look at the front, bring it in."
0,24,42,CLAIRE,It's swinging.
0,24,42,MELBURN,"It's okay, it's fine, we'll be fine. Careful."
0,24,42,GAMEKEEPER,You must try another alternative.
0,24,42,DANIEL,No.
0,24,42,GAMEKEEPER,You would allow your parents to suffer this awful death?
0,24,42,DANIEL,I won't play your game.
0,24,43,GAMEKEEPER,You are indeed an obstinate race.
0,24,44,JACK,You. You guys alright?
0,24,44,DANIEL,"I'm not really sure, to tell you the truth."
0,24,44,TEAL'C,What is this place?
0,24,44,DANIEL,"Well, it's the New York Museum of Art."
0,24,44,SAM,"Actually, we think it's a simulation of the museum, I figure we're in some sort of virtual reality world created from our minds, or at least Daniel's."
0,24,44,GAMEKEEPER,"You are a very stubborn, unimaginative and non-competitive race. Why do you refuse to enjoy the opportunities that I have given you?"
0,24,44,JACK,Enjoy? What makes you think I enjoy watching my friends get killed?
0,24,44,DANIEL,Or my parents die?
0,24,44,GAMEKEEPER,"You have both been given challenges to be met and conquered; you have it in you, why will you not partake?"
0,24,44,JACK,Why will you not just let us go?
0,24,44,GAMEKEEPER,"Go where? Where would you like to go? I can take you anywhere you can remember, anywhere you can imagine."
0,24,44,JACK,"Okay, we want to go free."
0,24,44,SAM,"So, we're right, this is a simulated world."
0,24,44,GAMEKEEPER,"It is a world completely inside your minds, channelled, co- ordinated and administered by myself, the Keeper."
0,24,44,SAM,But how? How does it work?
0,24,44,JACK,"I don't care how it works, I just want outta here."
0,24,44,GAMEKEEPER,"I cannot do that, the devices that enwrap you serve to nourish and stimulate your senses. The devices implanted in your brains channel experiences and imagination into and out of your mind."
0,24,44,SAM,"So, we're trapped with our brains hooked up like computers to some sort of network?"
0,24,44,GAMEKEEPER,"Yes, and your minds are very valuable to my residents because you enrich and add value to our own."
0,24,44,DANIEL,"Well, wait a minute, wait a minute, how long have you residents been in this virtual world?"
0,24,44,GAMEKEEPER,Roughly one thousand of your years.
0,24,44,JACK,"Well, we're certainly not gonna stick around for the next thousand of anyone's years."
0,24,44,DANIEL,"So, until we came along you've only had your own minds, your own experiences to provide scenarios for your virtual lives?"
0,24,44,GAMEKEEPER,You're beginning to understand.
0,24,44,DANIEL,"So, so, what, we're like new software? I mean, imagine you were locked in a room for a thousand years with only a VCR, a TV and five movies, how many times could you watch those five movies until you were bored silly? What you wouldn't give for just four more."
0,24,44,SAM,"So you're using our minds, our memories, imaginations, dreams for some sort of programming?"
0,24,44,GAMEKEEPER,"Actually, I can remove information from only two of your minds, this species' mind seems to protect against output, as does yours madam."
0,24,44,SAM,It does?
0,24,44,TEAL'C,"Perhaps because of the change in your mind the Goa'uld, Jolinar of Malkshur, left behind."
0,24,44,GAMEKEEPER,"But fear not, there is no block against input into your minds, you two can enjoy our adventures and these two minds, they provide more than enough rich experiences and imagination to provide years of entertainment for my residents."
0,24,44,JACK,"Well I'm sorry, with all due respect to you fine folks, I don't give a damn about residents, I just wanna get us out of here."
0,24,44,GAMEKEEPER,"It is I that am sorry, for I am not able to accommodate your request, but I am sure you will be able to enjoy the many adventures you will have here."
0,24,44,DANIEL,"Why are your people in here anyway? Why don't you just go out and get some new experiences of your own, live some new experiences?"
0,24,44,GAMEKEEPER,"We cannot leave our chambers, the world outside is uninhabitable, it has been poisoned and desecrated."
0,24,44,TEAL'C,You are mistaken; your planet is a fertile garden world.
0,24,44,GAMEKEEPER,"It is you who are mistaken, my alien friend, our planet was destroyed by a chemical disaster one thousand and twenty two years ago. We were victims of our own technology advancing faster than we could control it. At that time the few of us that were left placed our physical bodies in suspended animation."
0,24,44,SAM,Good news. Your planet seems to have regenerated itself.
0,24,44,GAMEKEEPER,This is not true! I monitor all conditions at all times!
0,24,44,SAM,"Well, then your monitoring systems are wrong, it is beautiful out there."
0,24,44,JACK,"Of course you already knew that. The question is, why don't you want them to know?"
0,24,44,GAMEKEEPER,Residents must not leave the environment. The outside world is uninhabitable!
0,24,44,JACK,"Who made you the warden here, huh?"
0,24,44,GAMEKEEPER,I do not understand.
0,24,44,DANIEL,Why are you the one running things here?
0,24,44,GAMEKEEPER,"The environment is my design; I am its creator, its Keeper."
0,24,44,JACK,"So if your residents leave, you lose control. That man is lying to you folks, he's got you imprisoned in your own."
0,24,45,JACK,"Well, that's good, that's fair, send them to where they can't hear the truth."
0,24,45,GAMEKEEPER,"Look, I will not allow you to poison their minds."
0,24,45,DANIEL,"Iif you keep us here you won't be able to stop us interacting with them for very long, especially if we're supposed to be new software for them."
0,24,45,GAMEKEEPER,"Very well, you weren't wanted here anymore anyway."
0,24,46,DANIEL,We're out.
0,24,46,JACK,Whoa.
0,24,46,SAM,Didn't that seem just a little too easy?
0,24,46,JACK,"Yes it did, let's go home."
0,24,47,JANET,"They all have small puncture wounds in their temples, spinal cords and several abdominal areas."
0,24,47,JACK,Meaning what?
0,24,47,JANET,"Well, looks like the machines you were describing were sustaining your lives; providing you with oxygen, feeding you, removing the waste and from the sounds of it completely controlling your nervous system."
0,24,47,HAMMOND,But is there any permanent damage?
0,24,47,JANET,"No, not that I can see; pupil dilation is bang on, reflexes are as they should be, everything seems fine to me."
0,24,48,DANIEL,"Jack, we should go back to the planet and free those people."
0,24,48,JACK,"I'm not sure it's anything of out business, frankly."
0,24,48,HAMMOND,"I concur, who are we to judge how someone on another planet lives?"
0,24,48,DANIEL,"But the people are in those machines under false pretences, the Keeper is lying to them about what's outside."
0,24,48,JANET,"Okay, if, if I may wade in here, all evidence points to the fact that those machines are sustaining those people, removing them could be like taking a patient off life support when he still needs it."
0,24,48,HAMMOND,"It sounds to me like we have to get more information to make a decision, folks."
0,24,48,TEAL'C,The only way to gain more information would be to venture back into the artificial world of P7J-989.
0,24,48,HAMMOND,Then that's exactly what I want you to do.
0,24,48,JACK,"Err... General, without meaning, this time, to sound like a smartass, are you cracked?"
0,24,48,HAMMOND,"Folks, I don't need to tell you how valuable a resource this planet could be for us. Their technology is far beyond our own - the kind of technology that justifies this entire programme."
0,24,48,SAM,"General Hammond, going back into that world could be very hazardous."
0,24,48,HAMMOND,"I fail to see how; it's an artificial environment, can you actually die in there?"
0,24,48,SAM,We don't know.
0,24,48,JACK,"I'm a little more concerned about being trapped there, Sir."
0,24,48,HAMMOND,You got out the last time.
0,24,48,TEAL'C,There is no guarantee we will be able to extract ourselves again.
0,24,48,HAMMOND,"Okay, I'll tell you what if you don't come out in one week, I'll send in SG-2 to pull you out, besides what's so bad about being in there? It sounds to me like you can experience all kinds of fascinating things."
0,24,48,JACKK,"You mean, like watching old friends die and..."
0,24,48,DANIEL,Parents.
0,24,48,JACK,Family getting killed over and over again.
0,24,48,HAMMOND,"Or seeing Major Kawalsky alive and well? Who knows, Colonel, maybe you could even see your son. Dr Jackson, perhaps you could visit the ancient worlds you've always wondered about. You can go anywhere your memories or imaginations want to go."
0,24,48,JACK,That's enough. Let's just have a look here shall we?
0,24,49,HAMMOND,"What are you doing, Colonel?"
0,24,49,JACK,I'm looking for the edges of a mask.
0,24,49,HAMMOND,What?
0,24,49,JACK,You're obviously not the real General Hammond.
0,24,49,HAMMOND,"Sit down, Colonel."
0,24,49,JACK,"I don't think so, bucko. The jig's up, we're on to ya."
0,24,49,HAMMOND,What are you talking about?
0,24,49,SAM,We're still on P7J-989.
0,24,49,JACK,"Oh, you betcha. This is just a new game brought to you by our good friend the Keeper."
0,24,49,HAMMOND,"You are way out of line, Colonel."
0,24,49,JANET,"You could be having a nervous reaction to the machines, we should get you back to the infirmary and run some tests."
0,24,49,JACK,"No, you should get us out of these damn machines is what you should do!"
0,24,49,JACK,"Oh, what!?"
0,24,49,HAMMOND,"Colonel, your insubordination is testing my patience. I will give you one final chance to follow my order and rejoin the residents of the artificial world."
0,24,49,SAM,Residents. That's what the Keeper called them.
0,24,50,HAMMOND,"Are you going back in or not, Colonel?"
0,24,50,JACK,I'm already in!
0,24,50,HAMMOND,Place SG-1 under arrest and place them in isolation where they can speak to no-one.
0,24,51,TEAL'C,"O'Neill, you seem quite confident that we are not on Earth."
0,24,51,JACK,Because we're not. Did that sound like the real General Hammond to anyone?
0,24,51,TEAL'C,It is my understanding that we can only experience past events in this environment.
0,24,51,SAM,Actually the Keeper said we can experience anything that we remember or that we can imagine.
0,24,51,JACK,"We're still on PJ7-nine eight niner, it's a fake environment."
0,24,52,KAWALSKY,"Is that really so bad? I mean come on, haven't you people missed me at all? Why are you resisting this? Think of all the fun we could have together. Doctor Jackson, you gotta admit I used to make you laugh. Colonel, who are you gonna get to play street hockey with who can kick your butt they way I can? Captain Carter, think what it would be like never to grow old, because you never do here you know."
0,24,52,JACK,Who are you?
0,24,52,KAWALSKY,"Who am I? Colonel, are telling me you don't remember me? I'm hurt, I'm really hurt."
0,24,52,JACK,"No, no, I know who you're pretending to be, but who are you really? Are you the Keeper?"
0,24,52,KAWALSKY,"Nah, not me."
0,24,52,JACK,"Then what? Some kind of projection, because you're not real and if you're not real you won't mind this."
0,24,53,JACK,Hello.
0,24,53,RESIDENT,We have been looking for you.
0,24,53,RESIDENT,"Please, tell us what you began to tell us before."
0,24,53,RESIDENT,About what it is like outside.
0,24,53,TEAL'C,It is in fact quite agreeable outside.
0,24,53,RESIDENT,The poison is gone?
0,24,53,RESIDENT,Everything is not dead?
0,24,53,DANIEL,"Well, no, quite the opposite, everything is blooming."
0,24,53,RESIDENT,How can that be? The Keeper tells us it is dangerous?
0,24,53,JACK,"Well, the Keeper lies."
0,24,53,RESIDENT,How can we trust these creatures above the Keeper who has cared for us for so long?
0,24,53,JACK,"I'll tell ya what, come with us. We'll show you."
0,24,53,DANIEL,Where are we going?
0,24,53,JACK,"Back through the gate to show them what their planet looks like, in our memories, before the virtual reality. Leave me alone."
0,24,54,HAMMOND,"Unauthorised Stargate activation, shutting down the gate. SG-1, you are trying my patience."
0,24,55,JACK,"Daniel, with me."
0,24,57,DANIEL,Do you think we're really out this time?
0,24,58,JACK,Hey!
0,24,58,GAMEKEEPER,"Please do not hurt me, I meant you no harm, understand my people' s existence has become stagnant, I wanted only good for them."
0,24,58,SAM,How long have you been coming out to tend this garden?
0,24,58,GAMEKEEPER,Lovely is it not?
0,24,58,JACK,How long?
0,24,58,GAMEKEEPER,"Oh, many, many years."
0,24,58,DANIEL,"Then why do you lie to your people? Why don't, why don't you give them the option to come out with you?"
0,24,58,GAMEKEEPER,"Because it was our kind that damaged the planet in the first place, if I let them out they will only hurt it again."
0,24,58,SAM,You're kidding.
0,24,58,TEAL'C,Perhaps your people will not make the same mistakes again.
0,24,58,JACK,"Yeah, you're big on giving people a second chance aren't ya?"
0,24,58,GAMEKEEPER,"No-one is preventing them from leaving, portals such as the one you've used are everywhere within."
0,24,58,DANIEL,"So, you mean we could've left anytime we wanted? All we had to do was go through one of those doors?"
0,24,58,GAMEKEEPER,"One may leave at any time, portals are always open."
0,24,58,JACK,"Of course, people have to know they exist to use them."
0,24,58,GAMEKEEPER,Which you have now shown them.
0,24,58,SAM,And they have to know there's somewhere to go.
0,24,58,GAMEKEEPER,"And you have told them that. You have ruined everything, poisoned their minds, the damage is done."
0,24,60,RESIDENT,"Again, we thank you; you have given us a whole new world of beauty and future experiences."
0,24,60,JACK,"Well you've still got a lot of work to do, but we'll send along some supplies to get you started."
0,24,60,GAMEKEEPER,They are ruining everything. Do you know they are actually picking the flowers?
0,24,60,JACK,"This is real this time, isn't it?"
0,24,61,GAMEKEEPER,"Do not pull that! You are ruining the garden! I told you they will ruin everything - first the garden, next the entire planet!"
0,24,61,JACK AND DANIEL,It's real.
0,24,61,GAMEKEEPER,You are ruining the garden!
0,24,61,JACK,Thank you ma'am.
