0,26,1,TECH,"""We have an inbound traveller. No SG signal code."""
0,26,4,SAM,"""There was no organic residue, but they did pick up a faint nuclear signature. Traces of iridium."""
0,26,4,DANIEL,"""Iridium, that's the radioactive stuff we put in the Sagan lnstitute box we left on Cimmeria."""
0,26,4,SAM,"""You got it. I wanted it there because it would leave a very recognizable signature."""
0,26,4,DANIEL,"""Same stuff?"""
0,26,4,SAM,"""Yeah."""
0,26,4,JACK,"""Weren't the locals supposed to give that box to Thor? Whoever, whatever he is?"""
0,26,4,TEAL'C,"""We assume he is a member of the Asgard, an extremely advanced culture."""
0,26,4,JACK,"""The fact of the matter is, we really don't know."""
0,26,4,DANIEL,"""The Asgards must've gotten the box and sent an answer. General, we have to respond before they leave."""
0,26,4,JACK,"""Um, you all know I take great pride in my title as Mr. Positive. However, we did destroy their de-Goa'ulding thing. Might not they look unkindly on that?"""
0,26,4,DANIEL,"""We did that to save Teal'c. I'm sure the Asgards didn't expect to trap a Jaffa who isn't an enemy. I'm sure they'd understand."""
0,26,4,HAMMOND,"""All right. I'll tell you what. We'll send a probe though at 1300 hours. If everything checks out, you have a go."""
0,26,5,TECH,"""Probe proceeding to iris!"""

0,26,10,DANIEL,"""Cimmerians use the word Etin for Goa'ulds. Gairwyn said the Etins are there. For a thousand years, Cimmeria was safe from Goa'uld attack and then we show up and screw up Thor's technology."""
0,26,10,TEAL'C,"""Daniel Jackson is correct. The Goa'uld usually send an advance scout though the Stargate to determine a planet's worth and vulnerability. If none of the scouts report back, it is a deterrent to invasion."""
0,26,10,SAM,"""The point is, sir, the Goa'uld are there and the locals aren't exactly much of a match for them."""
0,26,10,JACK,"""General, if we did screw up their world, we should take a little responsibility for fixing it, don't you think?"""

0,26,10,TEAL'C,"""The destruction of the hammer device to save my life may have caused this. If so, I am responsible."""
0,26,10,JACK,"""General, I gave the order."""

0,26,13,DANIEL,"""That's the Norse Armageddon.The end of the world."""
0,26,13,GAIRWYN,"""There was fire in the heavens. Five or six bursts in the sky in a straight line. But no sound. Then we heard an evil thunder and a great metal point came through the clouds."

0,26,15,DANIEL,"""Well, as a former Goa'uld host, Kendra would probably be a help. Can you take us to her?"""

0,26,16,GAIRWYN,"""Kendra and her family reside here. Hopefully, she is now with Thor."" ""My dearest friend. Kendra used her knowledge only to heal, and this was her reward. They've already killed over half of our people.It's customary to leave a person's favorite items outside their grave to take with them on their journey to Thor.

0,26,18,SAM,"""Why?"""
0,26,18,DANIEL,"""Well, Kendra retained the ability to use Goa'uld technology because she used to be a host to a Goa'uld. You must be able to retain the ability because you were a host to Jolinar."""
0,26,18,SAM,"""Yeah, but I have no control over this."""
0,26,18,GAIRWYN,"""Kendra said it took her years to master the magic of the power."""

0,26,19,SAM,"""Sorry."
0,26,19,DANIEL,"""Do you realise what this means? I mean, Sam could use one of these ribbon devices to help us fight the Goa'ulds! She could use one of those healing devices we saw Kendra use.Just... concentrate, like you did with the other thing."""

0,26,29,JACK,"""Well, the good news is, with enough artillery, we could blow those pyramids to high hell."""
0,26,29,DANIEL,"""And the bad news is?"""
0,26,29,TEAL'C,"""The Stargate is now heavily guarded. The Goa'uld are aware of our existence here."""
0,26,29,SAM,"""Which means we can't evacuate the Cimmerians."""

0,26,29,SAM,"""If we can use C4 to blow up a Goa'uld ship, couldn't we use it to blow up the camp?"""
0,26,29,JACK,"""Well, it's a small practical problem. If we use all the C4 to blow the camps now, what do we use when the ships and gliders show up later?"""
0,26,29,DANIEL,"""Guys, there's a third option here we might want to consider. There's a legend around here about a Hall of Thor's Might."""
0,26,29,JACK,"""Daniel, there's a time and place for mythology."""
0,26,29,SAM,"""Uh, with all due respect, sir, we thought Thor's hammer was a myth until we proved it was real."""
0,26,29,DANIEL,"J""ack, I think Thor's might may refer to an alien weapon or weapons that have been hidden away for centuries."""
0,26,29,SAM,"""We could use the fire power, sir."""
0,26,29,DANIEL,"""And Gairwyn said she'd take us there."""
0,26,29,JACK,"""Well, much as I hate to admit it, it sounds like our old buddy Thor is our best bet. Why don't you two try to find this...weapon, or whatever it is? Teal'c and I'll lay some explosives, see if we can slow the attack."""

0,26,29,JACK,"""Olaf?"""
0,26,31,GAIRWYN,"""This is it."""
0,26,31,DANIEL,"""This is the Hall of Might?"""

0,26,31,GAIRWYN,"""I'm sure this is it."""
0,26,31,DANIEL,"""Well, maybe this will send us somewhere else. Like the obelisk sent Jack and Teal'c to Thor's hammer."""

0,26,34,DANIEL,"""Oh, yeah, if you say so."""
0,26,34,SAM,"""So what does it mean?"""
0,26,34,DANIEL,"""I'm not sure. Maybe somehow we have to prove that we're worthy before he'll trust us with his might."""
0,26,34,SAM,"""Which you still think is a weapon."""
0,26,34,DANIEL,"""I'm hoping so, at this point."""
0,26,34,GAIRWYN,"""How can we prove our worth?"""

0,26,48,DANIEL,"""Well, remember, he thinks this is a protected planet, that his anti-Goa'uld devices are infallible. I mean, he couldn't know there would be any hurry to find whatever Thor's might is."""
0,26,48,SAM,"""Well, there is a hurry. Can you solve this?"""
0,26,48,DANIEL,"""Uh,OK. Um, they aren't letters, or words. Originally, runes were ideographic."""

0,26,48,DANIEL,"""Right. Now, the first one is associated with Thor's protective power."""
0,26,48,SAM,"""Well, that could mean anything. It could be the Goa'uld detector they had at the gate or-or even the hammer device."""

0,26,48,SAM,"""Great. What about the middle two?"""
