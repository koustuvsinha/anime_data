0,30,1,JACK,"""Conjecture, Captain?"""
0,30,1,SAM,"""My data is consistent with the probe, sir. No radiation, the air's almost 100% pollution free. Teal'c, it doesn't seem very likely that the Goa'uld are responsible for this does it? I mean, what with the indigenous people of this planet being, gone."""
0,30,1,TEAL'C,"""That is correct. A Goa'uld attack would have resulted in much more damage. Any technology would have been destroyed."""

0,30,11,TEAL'C,"""That is correct, but it is not. It is, in fact getting worse."""
0,30,13,JANET,"""He seems to be suffering from the side effects of a viral infection...fever, aches, chills..."""
0,30,13,SAM,"""And his Goa'uld isn't helping?"""
0,30,13,JANET,"""No. That's not the worse part."
0,30,13,JACK,"""What is?"""
0,30,13,JANET,"""The blood sample I took showed a rather disturbing amount of DNA that doesn't match Teal'c's."""
0,30,13,JACK AND DANIEL,"""What does that."
0,30,13,DANIEL,"Mean?"""
0,30,13,JANET,"""Actually, I'm not sure. To be perfectly honest with you, sir, I think I may be out of my league here."""
0,30,13,SAM,"""General, if I may. When I was assigned to the Pentagon, I had the chance to work with Dr. Timothy Harlow. He's one of the world's top geneticists and he has full security clearance."""

0,30,15,SAM,"""Timothy.You got here fast."""
0,30,15,HARLOW,"""With a chance to see this? Light speed wouldn't have been fast enough for me,and it's not a bit disappointing either. You're a front line set up."""
0,30,15,SAM,"""Well, you haven't seen the best yet. I just wish it could have been under better circumstances."""
0,30,15,JANET,"""Dr. Harlow has some bad news."

0,30,15,SAM,"""Uh, the subject's name is Teal'c...and what are you talking about?"""
0,30,15,JANET,"""The blood sample I took had only a small percentage of alien insect DNA in it."""
0,30,15,SAM,"""Right."
0,30,15,HARLOW,"""Now when the exact same sample of Teal'c's blood was tested only a few hours later, it revealed only one type of DNA strand present."""
0,30,15,JANET,"And it wasn't Teal'c's."""
0,30,15,SAM,"""Are you saying that the foreign DNA actually transformed Teal'c's DNA in the blood sample?"""
0,30,15,HARLOW,"""Well, DNA doesn't alter DNA. It's probably some sort of retro-virus present."""

0,30,15,HARLOW,
0,30,15,SAM,"""The Goa'uld that Teal'c carries is supposed to provide him with powerful immune capabilities."""
0,30,15,HARLOW,"""Yes, so I read on the plane. It's amazing, but in this case, it appears that it's merely stemming the tide rather than reversing the problem."""
0,30,15,SAM,"""What happens if the Goa'uld loses the battle?"""
0,30,15,HARLOW,"""Well, 30 years of research into Human DNA, until last year I didn't even know there were aliens."

0,30,20,HAMMOND,"""The president is currently unavailable."""
0,30,20,MAYBOURNE,"""This facility is front-line. Your mandate is search and retrieval. Mine is research and development. As a source of information, Teal'c has been invaluable to your operation. Now he may prove equally invaluable to mine. This organism could be the biological weapon."

0,30,21,HARLOW,"""Sam?"""
0,30,21,SAM,"""It had to be you. Damn it, Timothy, Teal'c is my friend. He's sick."
0,30,21,HARLOW,"""Yes he is and he's going to get the very best help available on this planet. But your facility is not equipped for this kind of situation and you know it."""
0,30,21,SAM,"""Please, don't tell me that you're ignorant here. I don't want to feel sorry for you."""
0,30,21,HARLOW,"""Maybourne's people can be unscrupulous, but if Teal'c is to have any chance, it is with me, and I will do the best that I can."""
0,30,23,JANET,"""General, I have a right to stop this. He is not well enough to be moved."""
0,30,23,MAYBOURNE,"""Fortunately, I have a second opinion."""
0,30,25,DANIEL,"""How can we just let this happen?"""
0,30,25,JACK,"""What do you want me to do?"""
0,30,25,SAM,"""As much as I don't trust Maybourne, I have to admit, Timothy is the best and he gave me his word he was gonna help Teal'c."""

0,30,26,JACK,"""Of course..."""

0,30,27,MAYBOURNE,"""That won't be necessary."""
0,30,27,HARLOW,"""Of course it is. We can, you want him to change."""
0,30,29,SAM,"""All I'm saying is that not withstanding what happened to Teal'c, there may be invaluable technology on that planet."""
0,30,29,JACK,"""Carter, there are bugs on that planet. Big, huge, ugly, honkin' bugs."""
0,30,29,HAMMOND,"""Colonel, we just picked up an emergency communication from the driver."

0,30,34,JACK,"All right, what the hell happened here?"""
0,30,34,HARLOW,"""Well, he just went crazy. He's so strong. I've never seen anything like that."""

0,30,34,HARLOW,
0,30,34,DANIEL,"""Why?"""

0,30,34,HARLOW,
0,30,34,DANIEL,"He depends on that Goa'uld to live."""
0,30,34,HARLOW,"""The alien insect's venom is affecting his physical makeup. With every passing moment he is ceasing to be a Jaffa. The larva may be the only thing that's holding that transformation back."""

0,30,43,JACK,"""OK,that's good news."
