0,33,1,JACK,"""What is it?"""
0,33,1,HAMMOND,"""Trinium. Captain Conner and SG11 discovered it on a routine exploratory mission on the planet PXY-887."""
0,33,1,SAM,"""Yeah, I remember hearing about this. It's supposed to be 100 times lighter and stronger than steel."""
0,33,1,HAMMOND,"""That's a sample of raw Trinium which is too brittle for manufacturing because of its impurities. We commissioned SG-11 to extract more Trinium samples from the planet. As of this morning, the are 48 hours overdue for the weekly check-in. It's time to find out why."""
0,33,1,DANIEL,"""Any indigenous people on the planet?"""
0,33,1,HAMMOND,"""Well, not according to a preliminary sweep by the UAV."""
0,33,1,JACK,"""Well, it is a big planet, sir."""
0,33,1,HAMMOND,"""True enough, and Conner's people have only scouted within a few miles of the base camp, but they picked up no radio traffic, EM signatures...no sign of any indigenous life whatsoever."""

0,33,7,JACK,"""Oh, please, aliens are always poking me full of holes."""
0,33,7,SAM,"""Right."""
0,33,7,DANIEL,"Y ou might be interested to know that the arrow was native North American, but of advanced design."""
0,33,7,SAM,"""Our preliminary tests show it was made of pure forged Trinium. If there are Native Americans on this planet, they've come a long way, technologically, in the past few hundred years."""
0,33,7,DANIEL,"""And we just marched in and started mining."""
0,33,8,HAMMOND,"""I've just talked to the Pentagon. While they're obviously concerned about finding SG-11, they also want to avoid further upsetting the indigenous people."""
0,33,8,SAM,"""Meaning the don't want to risk losing the Trinium."""
0,33,8,HAMMOND,"""You're secondary objective is to negotiate a mining treat with these people. Obviously, we've started our relations on the wrong foot."""
0,33,8,JACK,"""But that's so rare, sir."""
0,33,8,HAMMOND,"""Captain, as you are taking over command of SG-1 on this mission, my superiors have ordered me to remind you to be diplomatic."""

0,33,11,DANIEL,"""Currently extracting an average of 47 pounds of Trinium ore per day to increase our production four fold as the engineers have requested. It's a requisition request from Captain Conner. He just stops in mid sentence."""
0,33,11,SAM,"""Looks like they all stopped what they were doing and just left."""
0,33,12,TEAL'C,
0,33,12,SAM,"""So SG-11 was taken by surprise before the second charge went off."""
0,33,12,TEAL'C,"""That was my first conclusion, but there were no footprints leading away from the mine. It's as if they disappeared where they were standing."""

0,33,15,DANIEL,"""It's a clan crest, I believe, akin to the style of the central coast Salish Indians. It...it tells the story of the clans origin. This one tells of how they were brought here from a distant planet by evil rulers. Now, according to this figure , uh, the evil rulers were probably Jaffa, taking them from Earth."""
0,33,15,SAM,"""So this was once a Goa'uld planet?"""
0,33,15,DANIEL,"""Well, according to the crest, the Goa'uld were destroyed by Xe-ls, who's protected them ever since."""
0,33,15,SAM,"""Xe'ls?"""
0,33,15,DANIEL,"""He's the Salish's main spirit. On Earth he's a benevolent one, traditionally, and represented by this raven figure."""

0,33,22,SAM,"""Key...Trinium?"
0,33,22,TONANE,"""Yeah, that's what your friend called it. After Xe'ls took your friends, he told me to shoot an arrow through the circle of standing water to warn your kind not to return. I guess you didn't understand."""
0,33,22,SAM,"""Oh, no, we understood, but warning or no warning, it's not our custom to abandon our friends."""
0,33,22,TONANE,""" I could introduce you to Xe'ls...and we could tell him it was all a misunderstanding."""

0,33,22,SAM,"""Right."""
0,33,22,TEAL'C,"""Clearly, Tonane is blaming the spirits for his actions."""
0,33,22,SAM,"""Well clearly, but if it's the only way to get back SG-11, then I say we let him."""
0,33,23,DANIEL,"""Look, where ever we're going...there's probably going to be a ceremony of some kind. I don't know, they might even ask you to dance. But whatever it is, no matter how ridiculous it may seem, just try to go along with it."""
0,33,23,SAM,"""Don't worry.Tonane, uh, I was wondering, how is it that you remove the impurities from the ke so that it won't crumble?"""
0,33,23,TONANE,"""Well, first, we ask the, uh, the spirits to ask the mountain for the key. Then, if the mountain is in a good mood, they drop the ke in the river. The river cleans the key until it's shiny, and then we take it out of the river and shape it into whatever we need."""
0,33,23,SAM,"""Oh."""

0,33,25,TONANE,"""Yes, it is, Daniel."""
0,33,26,DANIEL,"""Xe'ls, we mean you and Tonane no harm. We apologize for any misunderstanding you've had with our friends. If you would release them we'd be very greatful.""Did you hear that? I'm almost sure that he said he would release them."""

0,33,30,SAM,"""Our people may need more than the river can provide, but we don't wish to shorten your supply. Now, we do have other mining methods that are less destructive."""
0,33,30,ELDER1,"""Perhaps Tonane could return with you through the circle of standing water and see these methods?"""
0,33,30,SAM,"""Yeah, that's a solution. Um, have any of your people ever traveled through the circle before?"""

0,33,31,SAM,"""Great,then it's settled."""
0,33,32,SAM,"""So, the elders agreed to allow Tonane to come back and observe our alternative mining methods and here we are."""

0,33,36,HAMMOND,"""Small deposits, washed down from the mountain over thousands of years. That may be enough Trinium to meet the needs of Tonane's tribe, but not enough for any practical application. Therefore, I have been ordered to consider other initiatives."""

0,33,67,DANIEL,"""Wait! You promised to listen."""
0,33,67,XE'LS,"""What they don't know won't hurt them. Isn't that what your leader said, Colonel? Their word means nothing."""
0,33,67,T'AKAYA,"""And so would mine, if I were to do as you asked. I have made a promise to this one, so that we could save your life."""
0,33,67,XE'LS,
0,33,67,JACK,"""For what?"""
0,33,67,XE'LS,"""For trying to deceive the Salish and steal our key, and for attempting to destroy the trust and faith between Tonane's people and my own."""
0,33,67,JACK,
0,33,67,T'AKAYA,"""Even if we could trust you, your superiors will not be swayed by your oath."""
0,33,67,JACK,"""So, don't take my word. Shut down your Stargate. That way, no one will be able to come to your planet unless you allow it."""
0,33,67,T'AKAYA,"""Star travel is of no use to us. Let us close down the gate."""
0,33,67,XE'LS,"""This does not erase the second transgression."""
0,33,67,JACK,"""What? Exposing who you are to Tonane? You've been posing as gods, for heaven's sake."""
0,33,67,T'AKAYA,"""Is that what you believe we do? When we removed the Goa'uld from our planet a millennia ago, we adapted our form to those of the Salish spirits so that we could protect and coexist along side them in harmony, without interfering in their natural evolution, and now, because of you, that harmony has been broken."""
0,33,67,XE'LS,"""In time, they will fear us, and use the key we scatter through the rivers and forge weapons against us."""
0,33,67,DANIEL,"""No. The Salish people you honour, came from this world. Even now they value the natural world far more than technology. Trust them."""
0,33,67,JACK,"""If you really do respect Tonane's people, you shouldn't be posing as their spirits. Trust them."""
0,33,67,T'AKAYA,"""Our friend. Tonane, is wise,and so is our friend, Jack."""
0,33,67,XE'LS,"""So he is."""
0,33,68,JACK,"""Tonane, Xe'ls. Xe'ls,Tonane."""
0,33,68,TONANE,"""So, you're Xe'ls?"""
0,33,68,T'AKAYA,"""And I am T'akaya. We are honored by the names your forefathers have given us."""
0,33,68,XE'LS,"""You view us now in our true form, but this is only one of many forms we can take. Our friends from this world call us aliens. You call us spirits. From now on, Tonane, you and your people will view us in the form which pleases you best."""
0,33,68,TONANE,"""You have always been kind to my people. So, whatever makes you happy."""
0,33,68,T'AKAYA,
0,33,68,TONANE,"""Does this mean I can go home now?"""
0,33,68,JACK,"Yeah, I think it does."""
0,33,68,TONANE,"""Goodbye, Jack."""
0,33,68,DANIEL,"""Oh, wait! What about our friends?"""
0,33,68,T'AKAYA,"""Your friends are right beside you, Daniel."""
0,33,69,HAMMOND,"""Colonel O'Neill?"""
0,33,69,JACK,"""Um.I'll explain it all later, sir."""
