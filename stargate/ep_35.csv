0,35,0,"""THE FIFTH RACE""",By Robert C. Cooper Briefing Room
0,35,1,DANIEL,"On the planet where we found Ernest Littlefield, PB2-908, we also found a repository of information."
0,35,1,JACK,Meaning of life sorta stuff.
0,35,1,DANIEL,"Yes, based on the four distinct alien languages inscribed on the wall we concluded it was some sort of meeting place, where these four races would."
0,35,1,HAMMOND,"We all re-read read the mission report, Doctor Jackson."
0,35,1,DANIEL,"Okay, right, well, two days ago the probe sent this image from P3R-272.Now if you look closely you'll see that the symbols match one of the inscriptions from the meeting place on Ernest's planet. So you realize what this means?"
0,35,1,HAMMOND,You know what this circle of symbols says?
0,35,1,DANIEL,"No, I don't even know what it sounds like, but based on the Norse rune at the bottom of this inscription I'm positive that one of the four race in the alliance is Thor's race, the Asgard, obviously that would make the aliens that belong to this race their allies."
0,35,1,TEAL'C,I do believe this world is worth exploring Daniel Jackson.
0,35,2,SAM,"Very strange. Breathable air, moderate temperature, but where's the life support coming from?"
0,35,2,JACK,Walls are solid.
0,35,2,TEAL'C,As the probe indicated there appears to be no exit.
0,35,2,JACK,"Well, this was an intergalactic waste of time."
0,35,2,SAM,"Well, wait a minute, Sir, where's the power for the lights coming from? What's the point of this place?"
0,35,2,DANIEL,"Hello! Hello! I'm Daniel Jackson, we're peaceful explorers from the planet Earth."
0,35,3,DANIEL,It was worth a try.
0,35,3,JACK,"Daniel, how long you figure we oughta hang out here and scratch our cosmic heads?"
0,35,3,DANIEL,"Well, we can't just give up."
0,35,3,JACK,"Why not? Lets go home. Okay, that's something."
0,35,4,JACK,Watcha self there Teal'c.
0,35,4,DANIEL,What do you see?
0,35,4,TEAL'C,"Blackness, filled with coloured lights."
0,35,5,JACK,Whoa!
0,35,6,SAM,Colonel!
0,35,6,DANIEL,"Jack, can you hear me?"
0,35,6,SAM,"His pulse is racing. Daniel, dial the 'gate."
0,35,8,FRAISER,Pupils are back to normal. Pulse is fine. You feel okay?
0,35,8,JACK,"Great, don't remember a thing."
0,35,8,SAM,You were catatonic for about an hour after that thing released your head.
0,35,8,FRAISER,Physically I can't find anything wrong with you.
0,35,8,JACK,"Well, okey dokey."
0,35,10,HAMMOND,So what caused this device to appear?
0,35,10,DANIEL,We're not sure.
0,35,10,TEAL'C,Colonel O'Neill passed through the circle on the floor just before the device appeared. I was the first to look into it.
0,35,10,HAMMOND,What did you see?
0,35,10,JACK,"Lights, he saw lights. That's what he said he saw, lights. We done?"
0,35,10,HAMMOND,Not exactly. Why didn't the device react to Teal'c the same way as it did to you?
0,35,10,JACK,I don't know.
0,35,10,TEAL'C,Perhaps because I am a Jaffa.
0,35,10,SAM,"We've seen alien technologies that have been sensitive to the presence of a Goa'uld before, like Thor's Hammer."
0,35,10,JACK,"Teal'c looked, I looked, it grabbed my head, I passed out, I came to, we're here, we're home. Can we go?"
0,35,10,SAM,"Sir, are you okay?"
0,35,10,JACK,"I'm fine, just fine. A little tired maybe."
0,35,10,HAMMOND,"Colonel, are you sure you're okay?"
0,35,10,JACK,I am absolutely fine. There is nothing cruvus with me. They all look at Jack.
0,35,10,JACK,What?
0,35,10,DANIEL,You just said there's nothing cruvus with you.
0,35,10,JACK,I did not.
0,35,10,DANIEL,"Yes, you did."
0,35,10,JACK,No I didn't.
0,35,10,DANIEL,"Yes, you did."
0,35,10,JACK,Didn't.
0,35,10,DANIEL,Did.
0,35,10,JACK,Didn't.
0,35,10,DANIEL,Did.
0,35,10,JACK,"Cruvus, what is that?"
0,35,10,DANIEL,"I don't know. Um, well, I'm guessing in the context of what you're saying you were trying to say that there's nothing wrong with you."
0,35,10,HAMMOND,"Why don't you take some time to relax, Colonel. You're dismissed, but do me a favor and stay on the base."
0,35,11,HAMMOND,Keep an eye on him.
0,35,12,TEAL'C,"What is the reason for these padded gloves, O'Neill?"
0,35,12,JACK,"So we don't hurt each other. I'll be honest with you, Teal'c, it's so you don't hurt me."
0,35,12,TEAL'C,"If our purpose is to not cause each other harm, why then are we doing battle?"
0,35,12,JACK,"What can I tell you , it's boxing. It's fun. Come on."
0,35,13,JACK,"Come on Teal'c, you've gotta move around a little bit, you've gotta dance."
0,35,13,TEAL'C,"I do not understand O'Neill, are we preparing to dance or to do battle?"
0,35,13,JACK,"Teal'c if you don't move around you're a sitting duck, you're a target. Huh, like that. I'm sorry are you alright?"
0,35,13,TEAL'C,I am fine.
0,35,13,JACK,Well that's why you've gotta move.
0,35,14,TEAL'C,"How was that, O'Neill?"
0,35,14,JACK,"That's good, that's good. Er, the thing about keeping your hands up... is my nose bleeding?"
0,35,14,TEAL'C,You are fine.
0,35,14,JACK,"Keep your hands up, you gotta keep moving your, your feet moving and er, bend your cosars, keep your cosars bent."
0,35,14,TEAL'C,I am unfamiliar with that word.
0,35,14,JACK,"What, cosars? Cosars, you gotta bend your cosars."
0,35,14,TEAL'C,"I believe you are referring to your legs, O'Neill."
0,35,15,JACK,"Alright, what the hell is going on with me?"
0,35,15,DANIEL,What do you mean?
0,35,15,JACK,"Well, apparently I have lost the falatus to speak properly. That wasn't a joke, I didn't do that on purpose."
0,35,15,TEAL'C,Several times now Colonel O'Neill has used strange words in place of common terms.
0,35,15,DANIEL,"Okay, well, what was that word you just used?"
0,35,15,TEAL'C,I believe it was falatus.
0,35,15,DANIEL,"Okay, sounds kinda close to Medieval Latin. So, possibly a derivation, maybe even a root. Faculatus is Latin for ability. You said you've lost the falatus to speak properly."
0,35,16,JACK,Nou ani anquietas.
0,35,16,DANIEL,What?
0,35,16,JACK,Nou ani anquietas. Hic qua videum.
0,35,16,DANIEL,"Jack, are you reading this?"
0,35,16,JACK,"I don't know, you tell me."
0,35,16,DANIEL,"Well, I don't know, I haven't been able to associate sounds to the symbols. Do you know what this means?"
0,35,16,JACK,"No, I'm just looking at it and the words just pop right into my fron. Does anybody think this is odd?"
0,35,17,DANIEL,The language he's speaking has similar sounds to Medieval Latin but they're still quite different.
0,35,17,SAM,So he's in the infirmary now?
0,35,18,DANIEL,"Yeah, but before we took him there, he picked up the chalk and did this in about thirty seconds flat. Do you have any idea what this means?"
0,35,18,SAM,"No. I mean, even the simple equations don't make any sense. No, this is like no math I've every seen."
0,35,19,FRAISER,A normal human brain operates at 5-10% of its functional capacity at any given time. Colonel O'Neill's brain is working at over 90% capacity.
0,35,19,SAM,How is that possible?
0,35,19,FRAISER,I don't know.
0,35,19,TEAL'C,Where is Colonel O'Neill?
0,35,19,FRAISER,"Well, he should be in the infirmary."
0,35,19,TEAL'C,He is not there.
0,35,20,SAM,"Teal'c, you take the Gate Room."
0,35,20,DANIEL,I'll check the locker room.
0,35,20,SAM,Right.
0,35,21,SAM,Colonel. What are you doing?
0,35,21,JACK,I need this.
0,35,22,SAM,What for?
0,35,22,JACK,I have no idea.
0,35,23,HAMMOND,Where is he now?
0,35,23,SAM,He's with Teal'c.
0,35,23,HAMMOND,Do you think his current condition poses any threat?
0,35,23,FRAISER,"Sir, I don't even know what's wrong with him. All I can tell you is his brain function has increased tenfold."
0,35,23,DANIEL,"Jack was able to read the alien language - both the inscription from the wall, the meeting place on Earnest's planet and the circle of symbols from 272, where this happened to him."
0,35,23,HAMMOND,What does it mean?
0,35,23,DANIEL,"Well, my translation's a little bit vague, um, I think the circle means the place of our legacy. Or it could be a piece of our leg, but the first seems to make more sense."
0,35,23,SAM,The point is Colonel O'Neill is unwillingly speaking an alien language.
0,35,23,DANIEL,We know the Asgard oppose the Goa'uld so it's possible all the members of this four-race alliance felt the same.
0,35,23,SAM,Which might explain why the viewer locked out Teal'c.
0,35,23,HAMMOND,What are you saying?
0,35,23,DANIEL,What if this device somehow downloaded an alien language into Jack's brain.
0,35,24,TEAL'C,Your presence is required in the control room.
0,35,25,HAMMOND,What's he doing?
0,35,25,TEAL'C,I do not know. Sam heads straight for a computer.
0,35,25,HAMMOND,Captain Carter?
0,35,25,SAM,"Main system's down, Sir. I'm locked out."
0,35,25,HAMMOND,Colonel.
0,35,25,JACK,"Yes, Sir."
0,35,25,HAMMOND,What are you doing?
0,35,25,JACK,"I don't know, Sir. You know me and computers."
0,35,25,HAMMOND,"Colonel, I'm ordering you to stop."
0,35,25,JACK,"I'd love to Sir, but I can't."
0,35,25,HAMMOND,Stop him. Teal'c tries to pull Jack away from the computer.
0,35,25,JACK,"No! No, not yet! I'm not finished!"
0,35,25,DANIEL,"Sir, I think he wants to finish what he's doing."
0,35,25,SAM,"I can't reboot, Sir."
0,35,26,SAM,Uh-oh.
0,35,26,HAMMOND,Captain? The numbers Jack entered come up on the computer screen.
0,35,26,SAM,"Sir, this is machine code. The numbers the Colonel was entering must've been some been some sort of program. J"
0,35,27,SAM,What did you do? Jack shakes his head.
0,35,27,SAM,It's the destination map. These are all the Stargates we've been through.
0,35,27,DANIEL,"Sam, are those new 'gates popping up?"
0,35,27,SAM,"That's not possible, it takes days to calculate the planetary shift of each new location. Whoa, wait a second. Sir, the new Stargates did not come from the Abydos cartouche data that we put in."
0,35,27,HAMMOND,"But that's the only reference we have, isn't it?"
0,35,27,SAM,The Colonel must've input new Stargate locations into the computer.
0,35,27,DANIEL,"Well, I guess that thing must've downloaded more that a language into your brain. That circular inscription read 'the place of our legacy'. What if that thing you looked into was some sort of alien database, like the one we found on Ernest's planet, all the knowledge that these particular aliens possessed?"
0,35,27,HAMMOND,"Colonel, you are not under arrest but you are also not to touch anything else on this base without permission. Understood?"
0,35,27,JACK,"Etium, Sir."
0,35,28,SAM,"You can only stare at a computer screen for so long. Colonel, that program you entered re-wrote massive amounts of the machine code. Jack doesn't respond."
0,35,28,DANIEL,Jack seems to have completely lost the ability to speak anything but the alien language.
0,35,28,SAM,Really? Wow.
0,35,28,DANIEL,"But the good news is we seem to have more of the alien inscription translated. Nou ani anquietus, We are the Ancients."
0,35,28,SAM,Who are the Ancients?
0,35,28,DANIEL,"Well, I think they could be the teachers of roads. See, the Romans were the first real road builders. They spoke Latin and they learned to build roads from the gods, known as the Ancient ones."
0,35,28,SAM,I'm still not following you.
0,35,28,DANIEL,Roads. Stargates. The gate builders. What if these Ancients were the alien race who invented the Stargate?
0,35,28,SAM,"You're still just speculating, right?"
0,35,28,DANIEL,"Well, that would certainly explain why Jack knew about Stargates the Goa'uld haven't even discovered yet."
0,35,28,SAM,"I don't know, Daniel. Why would they invent a device that would do this?"
0,35,28,DANIEL,"The place of our legacy, to pass on their knowledge. Jack may have the knowledge of the original 'gate builders downloaded into his brain."
0,35,28,JACK,Ego indeo navo locas.
0,35,28,DANIEL,"Okay, ego means I."
0,35,28,JACK,Indeo.
0,35,28,DANIEL,Need.
0,35,28,JACK,Navo.
0,35,28,DANIEL,New.
0,35,28,JACK,Locas.
0,35,28,DANIEL,"Locas, locas, locas. Locatia. Location. You need a new location. You need a new location?"
0,35,28,SAM,Where do you wanna go? Jack doesn't seem to know.
0,35,28,SAM,"Okay, good luck you guys, I've got to get back to the computer. Sir, I really wish you could explain all this."
0,35,29,SAM,"Ten equals eight. Ten equals eight, ten equals eight. Ten equals eight. Sir, this is base eight math!"
0,35,30,FRAISER,"The problem may only be affecting the verbal language centre of your brain. It's a different function than writing, but it looks like the problem is advancing. Since he lost the ability to speak gradually, I think whatever is affecting him might be taking over incrementally."
0,35,30,DANIEL,"Well, what's the worst-case scenario?"
0,35,30,FRAISER,"Well your computer analogy is pretty good. Colonel, your hard drive has been filled with information that is written in a language your computer doesn't understand. If it continues to progress the way it has thus far you may eventually lose the ability to write or even comprehend us. Or worse the computer could shut down all together."
0,35,31,SAM,"Sir, we've been sending probes through to the addresses Colonel O'Neill entered into the computer, hoping that one would lead us to the race that affected his mind. We think we may have found something."
0,35,31,DANIEL,
0,35,31,HAMMOND,Then I suggest we check it out. You're authorized to go Captain; Major Castleman will be joining SG-1 on this mission.
0,35,31,DANIEL,Well if Jack's not going then I have to stay.
0,35,31,HAMMOND,Why's that Doctor?
0,35,31,DANIEL,"Well if Sam and Teal'c make contact with the Ancients then they can report back and then Jack and I will go, but until then, I mean, translating this language may be the most important thing we've done since we opened the Stargate. You see I'm pretty sure that Jack is speaking the language of the original gate builders, at the very least I'm positive that it's one of the races that created the repository of information on Earnest's planet, the, meaning of life stuff."
0,35,31,SAM,"And, Sir, I believe that the equation Colonel O'Neill wrote on the blackboard is a revolutionary formula for calculating the distance between planetary bodies."
0,35,31,DANIEL,"And, bottom line, Sir, what about Jack, right now I'm possibly his only hope for communicating on any serious level. I can't leave him like this, and I won't."
0,35,31,HAMMOND,Alright. The rest of you will leave at 1600 hours.
0,35,32,HAMMOND,
0,35,33,DANIEL,"Okay, I think we're getting hung up on the grammar. What?"
0,35,33,DANIEL,"Okay, you have to go through the Stargate. Where, where to? Back to the planet where this happened, you have to go back there?"
0,35,34,HAMMOND,Come.
0,35,34,SIMMONS,"Sir, SG-1 did not return the probe on schedule."
0,35,34,HAMMOND,Lets open the gate and try to make contact.
0,35,34,SIMMONS,"Yes, Sir."
0,35,35,SIMMONS,
0,35,35,SAM,Do not send rescue team. Repeat. Do not send rescue team.
0,35,35,HAMMOND,This is General Hammond. We copy Captain. Where's Major Castleman?
0,35,35,SAM,"He's looking for shelter, Sir. We're in a little trouble here, we can't dial out; the DHD seized up when we tried to send the probe back. Temperature here is increasing rapidly which probably explains why we haven't found indigenous life forms. The probe data did not reveal a second sun, which rose about half an hour ago. General, we're gonna get one heck of a sunburn if we stay here much longer."
0,35,35,HAMMOND,Can you dial in manually?
0,35,35,SAM,"Teal'c's attempting a manual dial now, Sir, but we can't do anything with the wormhole open from your end."
0,35,35,HAMMOND,"I copy that, Captain. If you're not back in one hour we will open the wormhole again for further communication. Good luck, SGC out."
0,35,36,DANIEL,What's he doing now?
0,35,36,FRAISER,Building something. I've been taking some notes but I'm finding it a little hard to follow.
0,35,36,DANIEL,I have to go downstairs; Sam and Teal'c are in trouble.
0,35,36,FRAISER,What?
0,35,36,DANIEL,"Just don't tell Jack, I think he's got enough on his mind."
0,35,37,SCIENTIST,"Sir, this Milar material added to a standard issue field tent should provide 10-20 degrees worth of protection."
0,35,37,SIMMONS,We've augmented some air coolers to work with portable generators.
0,35,37,DANIEL,But how are they gonna get home?
0,35,37,SCIENTIST,"Well, based on Captain Carter's description of the problem we've been running probability tests using the function data we correlated so far, from the DHD found in Antarctica."
0,35,37,HAMMOND,Do you understand what he just said?
0,35,37,DANIEL,It sounds like they have no idea.
0,35,37,SCIENTIST,"Well actually it's not no idea, Sir, just not much of one yet."
0,35,37,SIMMONS,But we're working on it.
0,35,38,SAM,"Manual dial in failed, Sir. DHD is stuck mid-dial and seems to be locking the 'gate in place."
0,35,38,DANIEL,Are we recording this?
0,35,38,SIMMONS,"Yes, Sir."
0,35,38,SAM,By my calculations we could be facing a temperature of over 200 degrees Fahrenheit in less than four hours.
0,35,38,HAMMOND,"Captain, we're sending through a package of heat resistant tents and portable air coolers."
0,35,38,SAM,"General, I don't think you understand how hot it's gonna get. Nothing you send us will provide enough protection. We'll be dead before the end of the day, Sir."
0,35,39,FRAISER,I think he's finished.
0,35,39,DANIEL,What is it?
0,35,40,DANIEL,"That's it? Okay, well lets, lets just leave this thing for now, believe it or not I have something a little more important to discuss."
0,35,41,DANIEL,"I didn't want to tell you this before because I thought you had enough on your mind. Sam, Teal'c and the rest of SG-1 are in trouble; the DHD on P9Q-281 isn't working and they can't get home; to make matters worse there's a very hot sun rising. They don't have much time."
0,35,42,SAM,"The rest of the symbols won't engage, the DHD is locking the gate in place so we can't dial out manually. I've tried everything I know about these things."
0,35,42,DANIEL,"Look, no-one else believes you have the knowledge of the original gate builders in your head right now except me."
0,35,43,FRAISER,Whats he doing?
0,35,43,DANIEL,I don't know.
0,35,43,FRAISER,Do you think this is going to help?
0,35,43,DANIEL,
0,35,44,DANIEL,: Shut up and go away.
0,35,46,SIMMONS,The problem they're having is powering up the DHD and getting it to recharge its capacitors.
0,35,46,SCIENTIST,Removing the power source and reinstalling always rebooted the system in the tests.
0,35,46,SIMMONS,But we've never simulated a mid-dial lock out.
0,35,47,DANIEL,We have to dial in right now.
0,35,47,HAMMOND,What is it?
0,35,47,FRAISER,The Colonel has a solution.
0,35,47,SCIENTIST,He does? Jack rolls out the plans on the table.
0,35,47,DANIEL,We weren't sure what he was drawing at first but.
0,35,47,SCIENTIST,That's the dial home device.
0,35,47,DANIEL,And the instructions on how to fix it. There isn't much time.
0,35,48,DANIEL,"Here, you guys can work on this for a while."
0,35,48,SCIENTIST,What is it?
0,35,48,DANIEL,"No idea, well not no idea, just not much of one yet, but work on it."
0,35,49,SIMMONS,"The object has reached its destination, Sir."
0,35,49,HAMMOND,Now we have to hope those instructions were right.
0,35,50,HAMMOND,Glad to have you back.
0,35,50,SAM,"Thought our goose was quite literally cooked this time, Sir. These plans were perfect, who came up with them? Colonel? Jack shrugs."
0,35,50,TEAL'C,I am sorry O'Neill. We could not find a way to help you.
0,35,51,DANIEL,Feel better?
0,35,51,SAM,"Much, thanks. Is this what you wanted to show me?"
0,35,51,DANIEL,"Yes, Jack built it but no-one seems to be able to figure out what it is."
0,35,51,SAM,"Colonel, you have no idea what it is or why you built it?"
0,35,53,HAMMOND,We were preparing to send SG-11 to the next new Stargate address that Colonel O'Neill programmed into the computer.
0,35,53,SIMMONS,"The gate wouldn't dial out, the computer's frozen."
0,35,53,SAM,"That doesn't make any sense, we've just run a full diagnostic. The Stargate's trying to draw more power than usual from the system."
0,35,54,DANIEL,I'm guessing we should follow him.
0,35,55,TEAL'C,Should we not attempt to stop him Daniel Jackson?
0,35,55,DANIEL,"Wait a minute. Jack, what are you doing?"
0,35,55,JACK,Euge.
0,35,55,DANIEL,"I think that means good.Jack, I really don't know if this is a good thing."
0,35,55,JACK,Euge. Euge.
0,35,55,DANIEL,I don't think he understands us anymore.
0,35,57,SAM,"Sir, somehow the Stargate just got a huge power boost. It's drawing ten times more power than normal."
0,35,57,HAMMOND,Isn't that impossible?
0,35,57,SAM,"Yes, Sir, the circuits should've blown."
0,35,57,HAMMOND,This is General Hammond. I want Sergeant Siler and a maintenance crew to the power room immediately.
0,35,58,SAM,"Sir, the 'gate is dialing out."
0,35,58,HAMMOND,Where to?
0,35,58,SAM,"I have no way of knowing. We've completely lost control, Sir."
0,35,58,SCIENTIST,"Chevron five is encoded. Daniel, Jack and Teal'c enter."
0,35,58,DANIEL,The device that Jack built is some sort of energy source; he just hooked it up in the power vault.
0,35,58,SAM,"Well, that explains where the gate's getting all the extra power."
0,35,58,HAMMOND,"I would not have authorized that Doctor Jackson. Captain, how do we stop this?"
0,35,58,SAM,You could have Siler pull the main breaker.
0,35,58,SIMMONS,Chevron six is encoded.
0,35,58,DANIEL,Wait! Jack has been saying that this is a good thing. Now so far he's done nothing bad.
0,35,58,HAMMOND,So far.
0,35,58,SIMMONS,Chevron seven is encoded?
0,35,58,SAM,And it's not the point of origin.
0,35,58,HAMMOND,What?
0,35,58,DANIEL,"General, what if all these anomalies that have been happening to Jack, are part of some big plan?"
0,35,58,HAMMOND,What plan?
0,35,58,DANIEL,"Well, earlier Jack was telling me he had to go through the 'gate. Maybe everything up until now has been leading to this."
0,35,58,SAM,What's it doing?
0,35,58,SIMMONS,Chevron eight is locked.
0,35,59,SIMMONS,Wormhole is tracking.Captain?
0,35,59,SAM,"Sir, the computer indicates that the wormhole is leaving our known network of Stargates. It's going outside of our galaxy. Far out."
0,35,59,DANIEL,That's why the gate needed all the extra power.
0,35,59,HAMMOND,"Hold on, I thought Stargate addresses were six points in space with the seventh being the point of origin."
0,35,59,SAM,"The extra chevron must add a new distance calculation to the existing points, kinda like dialing a different area code."
0,35,59,HAMMOND,Now what?
0,35,60,HAMMOND,Colonel!
0,35,60,HAMMOND,I'm just supposed to let you go?
0,35,60,DANIEL,"He's already gone, General; I don't think we have much of a choice."
0,35,61,TEAL'C,I will accompany you O'Neill.
0,35,61,DANIEL,"I really think he needs to do this alone, Teal'c."
0,35,62,HAMMOND,I really hope this is the right thing to do.
0,35,63,SAM,"Wait, without the remote code device he won't be able to get back."
0,35,63,HAMMOND,"Without knowing where he's going and why, that could put us in further jeopardy. I'm sorry, I can't authorize it."
0,35,64,DANIEL,"Jack. You understand that if you do this, if you go, you might not be able to come back."
0,35,66,SIMMONS,Traveler is still on route.We've lost the traveler!
0,35,67,JACK,Arrgh!
0,35,68,JACK,"Ego, deserdi, asordo."
0,35,68,ASGARD #1,He's human. From Earth.
0,35,68,ASGARD #2,But he's speaking the language of the Ancients.
0,35,68,JACK,"Comdo, asordo."
0,35,68,ASGARD #2,He wants help.
0,35,70,SAM,Prepare to redial.
0,35,71,HAMMOND,Hammond.
0,35,71,SIMMONS,"It's Sergeant Siler, Sir; the device that's hooked to the power grid seems to be dead."
0,35,72,JACK,Hello. Thank you.
0,35,72,ASGARD #1,You are welcome.
0,35,72,JACK,You understand me?
0,35,72,ASGARD #2,We speak many languages.
0,35,72,JACK,"You're the Asgard. Thor's race, right?"
0,35,72,ASGARD #1,You have heard of us?
0,35,72,JACK,Nothing but good things.
0,35,72,ASGARD #2,You looked into the archive that stores all the Ancients' knowledge.
0,35,72,JACK,Apparently.
0,35,72,ASGARD #2,It was not meant for you.
0,35,72,JACK,"What, this was all an accident?"
0,35,72,ASGARD #1,Human physiology has not advanced to the point where your brain could handle that technology.
0,35,72,JACK,Oh. So where am I?
0,35,72,ASGARD #1,"This is the Asgard planet, Othala, in the galaxy of Ida."
0,35,72,JACK,Why did I come here?
0,35,72,ASGARD #2,"The Ancients moved on from our region of space long ago, but your sub-conscious mind used their knowledge to find us here, where you could get help."
0,35,72,ASGARD #1,Very impressive.
0,35,72,JACK,"Well, you know."
0,35,72,ASGARD #1,We did not think your brains had advanced even that far.
0,35,72,JACK,How is it you know so much about our brains?
0,35,72,ASGARD #1,We have studied your race closely.
0,35,72,JACK,Ah. What did you learn?
0,35,72,ASGARD #2,That your species has great potential.
0,35,72,JACK,"Great potential, that's good."
0,35,72,ASGARD #1,"Understand this, there was once an alliance of four great races in the galaxy; the Asgard, the Nox..."
0,35,72,JACK,Met them.
0,35,72,ASGARD #1,The Furlings.
0,35,72,JACK,Don't know them.
0,35,72,ASGARD #1,"And the Ancients, the builders of the Stargates."
0,35,72,JACK,Pretty heady group.
0,35,72,ASGARD #1,The alliance was built over many millennia. Your race has much to prove before we may interact on that level.
0,35,72,JACK,"Look, you all seem to be quite wonderful, people, and I don't want to sound ungrateful because I really, really appreciate you getting all that stuff out of my head, but you folks should understand that we're out there, now, and we might not be ready for a lot of this stuff but we're doing the best we can. We are a very curious race."
0,35,73,ASGARD #2,You have already taken the first steps towards becoming the fifth race
0,35,74,SAM,"Sir, we're gonna have to shut the whole system down and reboot."
0,35,74,HAMMOND,Can you close the Stargate if necessary?
0,35,74,SAM,Apparently not.
0,35,74,DANIEL,That's not good.
0,35,74,HAMMOND,"Captain, I don't care what you have to do, I want control of this system back."
0,35,74,SAM,"Yes, Sir, I'm trying."
0,35,75,SAM,We have an incoming wormhole.
0,35,76,SAM,"Everything seems to be back online again, Sir, including the iris."
0,35,76,HAMMOND,"Good work, Captain."
0,35,77,JACK,I'm back.
0,35,77,DANIEL,What happened?
0,35,77,TEAL'C,Do you still possess the knowledge of the Ancients?
0,35,77,JACK,Nope. Don't remember a thing.
0,35,78,JACK,But ya know that meaning of life stuff? I think we're gonna be alright...
