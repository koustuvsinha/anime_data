0,37,0,"""HOLIDAY""",By Tor Alexander Valenza The team are offworld and are looking around a building
0,37,0,JACK,"Looks like somebody's closed for the winter, hmm?"
0,37,0,SAM,"Teal'c, is this Goa'uld technology?"
0,37,0,TEAL'C,These devices are unfamiliar to me.
0,37,1,SAM,"Oh, this is interesting."
0,37,1,DANIEL,I wonder what's in there?
0,37,2,MA'CHELLO,I am in there.
0,37,3,MA'CHELLO,I am unarmed.
0,37,3,JACK,Who are you?
0,37,4,TEAL'C,"You are the one called Ma'chello, are you not?"
0,37,4,MA'CHELLO,Do I know you?
0,37,4,TEAL'C,"You do not, but I have seen images of you, although your face had not seen as many years, it was you. Since before I was born this man has been a fugitive from the System Lords. One of my first assignments as first prime of Apophis was to hunt this man."
0,37,4,DANIEL,What did he do?
0,37,4,TEAL'C,"He was developing advanced technology to battle the Goa'uld. He was captured and tortured. The System Lords marked him to become a Goa'uld host, so his knowledge could be retained. Before the ceremony of implantation, he killed several Jaffa and escaped."
0,37,4,JACK,He did that?
0,37,4,MA'CHELLO,I am not this person you speak of; you are mistaken.
0,37,4,DANIEL,"You don't have to be afraid, we're not Goa'ulds."
0,37,4,MA'CHELLO,"We're not? Of course we are not! Then if we are not Goa'ulds, who are we?"
0,37,4,DANIEL,"Well, I'm Daniel Jackson, from the planet Earth."
0,37,4,MA'CHELLO,"Yes, Yes! That's right, I am Daniel Jackson from the planet Earth, pleased to meet you."
0,37,4,DANIEL,"No, I'm Daniel Jackson."
0,37,4,MA'CHELLO,"No, I'm Daniel Jackson."
0,37,4,SAM,"These are very interesting machines, are they inventions to fight the Goa'uld?"
0,37,4,MA'CHELLO,"Yes, inventions to fight the Goa'uld!"
0,37,4,DANIEL,"Well, do you think you could show us how they work?"
0,37,4,MA'CHELLO,"Are we sure, we are not Goa'uld?"
0,37,4,MA'CHELLO,"You, you! You, here quickly, inventions to fight the Goa'uld."
0,37,5,SAM,Daniel!
0,37,5,MA'CHELLO,"I'm fine, I think. Are you alright, Sir?"
0,37,5,SAM,He's got a pulse.
0,37,5,JACK,"Alright, Carter, why don't you dial us out of here, Teal'c, grab the gentleman. Lets take him back to the base."
0,37,5,SAM,"Yes, Sir."
0,37,7,JANET,"Well, everything seems fine, all your numbers are normal."
0,37,7,MA'CHELLO,"Good, I feel fine."
0,37,7,JANET,"Yeah? You just, you seem a little out of it Daniel, is something bothering you?"
0,37,7,MA'CHELLO,No. I'm just exhausted.
0,37,7,JANET,"Well, that's not unusual for someone who just received a high voltage electric shock. Any idea what that machine was suppose to do? Okay, well, if you're not back to normal in a couple of days, you let me know."
0,37,8,JANET,"Oh, wait a minute; I don't want you driving for a couple of days."
0,37,8,MA'CHELLO,Alright.
0,37,8,JANET,Okay. As Daniel leaves he sees Ma'chello in a bed.
0,37,8,MA'CHELLO,How is he?
0,37,8,JANET,"Not good. He has severe scar tissue all over his body, looks like he was burned or electrocuted. My guess is he was tortured."
0,37,8,MA'CHELLO,He's not going to live much longer is he?
0,37,8,JANET,I don't think so.
0,37,10,HAMMONDS,"Let's continues without Doctor Jackson, Captain Carter, you were about to brief us about the device."
0,37,10,SAM,"Yes, Sir, I believe it's some sort of database for all of Ma'chello's inventions; these symbols are like icons on a computer, when I press one of them a schematic diagram appears with notes on the side."
0,37,10,HAMMONDS,Any idea on what any of it is?
0,37,10,SAM,"Well, Sir, that's the problem, it's not in any dialect I understand, I was hoping that Daniel or maybe Teal'c could shed some light on these symbols."
0,37,10,TEAL'C,I do not recognize them.
0,37,11,MA'CHELLO,I apologize.
0,37,11,HAMMONDS,"How are you, Doctor Jackson?"
0,37,11,MA'CHELLO,"Tired, Doctor Fraiser said it'll wear off in a few days; I'll be fine."
0,37,11,SAM,"Daniel, do you recognize any of these symbols?"
0,37,12,MA'CHELLO,No.
0,37,12,HAMMONDS,"Keep trying people, this could be some valuable technology. Dismissed."
0,37,12,MA'CHELLO,"General? Doctor Fraiser thought I should go home, get some rest."
0,37,12,HAMMONDS,Take a day.
0,37,12,MA'CHELLO,Thank you.
0,37,13,MA'CHELLO,"Thank you, I'll be fine from here."
0,37,13,DRIVER,"Yes, Sir."
0,37,15,JACK,"You called, Sir?"
0,37,15,DANIEL,"Jack, Sam, Teal'c, finally."
0,37,15,JACK,How does this gentleman know our names? General Hammond doesn't know.
0,37,15,DANIEL,"As I've been trying to tell the General and the good Doctor here, I am not Ma'chello, I am Daniel Jackson."
0,37,15,JACK,"Oh, here we go."
0,37,15,DANIEL,"I realize what I look like, but I'm telling you that machine somehow switched us."
0,37,15,JANET,"He, knows a lot about Daniel."
0,37,15,DANIEL,"Ask me anything, something only Daniel would know."
0,37,15,SAM,"Okay, who's Cassandra?"
0,37,15,DANIEL,"She's a 12 year old girl, we found abandoned on P8X-987."
0,37,15,P8X..?,
0,37,15,SAM,"[987, yeah."
0,37,15,JACK,"Alright, lucky guess."
0,37,15,HAMMONDS,Where was the Stargate found?
0,37,15,DANIEL,At a dig in Giza.
0,37,15,JACK,"Alright, describe for me, the dress your sister wore last week, when I took her out."
0,37,15,DANIEL,"I don't have a sister, Jack, and if I did I wouldn't let you near her."
0,37,15,HAMMONDS,"Okay, lets assume for a moment that you are Daniel Jackson; then who the hell did we just send home?"
0,37,16,MA'CHELLO,"Hello friend, I am new to this area, I would like to learn about your culture and customs, will you teach me? Do you not understand me?"
0,37,16,FRED,"Spare any change, please?"
0,37,16,MA'CHELLO,Why does no-one answer me?
0,37,16,FRED,Cos you're strange.
0,37,16,MA'CHELLO,Am I? Tell me how I am strange?
0,37,16,FRED,"Man, you can't be just walking up to people you don't know in the street and talking all weird like that, asking for stuff."
0,37,16,MA'CHELLO,Isn't that what you are doing?
0,37,16,FRED,"Well, Yeah, but..."
0,37,16,MA'CHELLO,Then you must be strange as well.
0,37,16,FRED,"I've been called worse, sure, I'm strange too."
0,37,16,MA'CHELLO,I am called Ma'chello.
0,37,16,FRED,I'm Fred.
0,37,16,MA'CHELLO,"Let us feast together, Fred, and celebrate our strangeness and new found friendship."
0,37,16,FRED,On you?
0,37,16,MA'CHELLO,"If that is the custom, we will feast 'on me'."
0,37,17,HAMMONDS,Doctor Fraiser?
0,37,17,JANET,"Well, Sir, medically speaking he is an elderly gentleman suffering from acute pulmonary damage, with the conscious awareness and memory of Doctor Daniel Jackson."
0,37,17,HAMMONDS,How?
0,37,17,JANET,"Well, I can't tell you the method used to do it, General, but I can tell you that our personality, our memory, our conscious selves are derived from unique networks of neurons in the cerebral cortex; somehow Daniel's networks were remapped onto the old man's by that alien device."
0,37,17,JACK,"So this could be a one-way deal, right?"
0,37,17,JANET,"I'm not following, Sir."
0,37,17,JACK,"We don't know that it went both ways, Daniel could still be, Daniel."
0,37,17,HAMMONDS,His doorman said he never came into the building after he was dropped off.
0,37,17,JACK,"There you go, lets find him."
0,37,17,SAM,And what if he isn't Daniel?
0,37,17,HAMMONDS,"We're going to have to prepare for that possibility, Doctor Fraiser?"
0,37,17,JANET,"Sir, this, er, problem is beyond my expertise. I'm going to have to consult with some neuro specialists, Sir."
0,37,17,HAMMONDS,Do it.
0,37,17,JACK,"General, wouldn't it be a little easier if we just went back got this machine and tried to slam it into reverse?"
0,37,17,HAMMONDS,"Alright, Colonel, retrieve it but consider that device hazardous material, prepare yourself accordingly."
0,37,17,JACK,"Yes, Sir."
0,37,18,SAM,"I'm going to check out Ma'chello's room, maybe he has some electronic notebooks I can actually read."
0,37,18,JACK,"Alright. Captain, maybe you shouldn't touch anything in there."
0,37,18,SAM,"I'll be careful, Sir. Sam leaves, Jack and Teal'c get out some covers to put over the handles of the machine so they don't directly touch it and get swapped"
0,37,18,JACK,"Alright, I'm going to get mine on first, here. Jack slides the covers on, followed by Teal'c."
0,37,18,JACK,"Alright, on three....1,2"
0,37,18,SAM,Colonel!
0,37,18,JACK,Captain?
0,37,18,SAM,"Sorry. I think I know how Ma'chello has lived so long. I think this is some sort of medical device, there's all sorts of tubes and thermal units that look like they're for life support."
0,37,18,TEAL'C,But Ma'chello was conscious when we found him.
0,37,18,SAM,"Well, maybe it's triggered to automatically deactivate when someone comes through the 'gate."
0,37,18,TEAL'C,Then we can place Daniel Jackson in the hibernation chambers so his body can be maintained.
0,37,18,SAM,"Yeah, possibly, if I can figure out how to get it to work again."
0,37,18,JACK,"How long, Captain?"
0,37,18,SAM,"I don't know, Sir, I might not be able to figure it out at all."
0,37,18,JACK,"Well, then lets get this thing back to Earth, it might be all we need."
0,37,18,JACK,"On three. One, two, three."
0,37,19,SAM,What?
0,37,20,HAMMONDS,"How did it go, Colonel?"
0,37,20,TEAL'C,"It did not go well, General Hammond."
0,37,20,JACK,You think!
0,37,21,TEAL'C,This is indeed uncomfortable.
0,37,21,JACK,"How do ya think I feel, Teal'c? I've got a snake in my gut, you've got a comfortable, normal body."
0,37,21,TEAL'C,"It is normal to you, O'Neill, having a symbiote within is normal to me."
0,37,21,JACK,"Yeah, well, whatever, it's bad, okay?"
0,37,22,SAM,Hey.
0,37,22,TEAL'C,Have they located Doctor Jackson?
0,37,22,SAM,"No, they're still looking. The good news is I've found the switching device on Ma'chello's computer; problem is all of the notations are in that strange dialect. You know, when you think about it, it's actually kind of a good thing that this happened. I mean, I can experiment with the two of you and then when they find Daniel/Ma'chello we can reverse the process, assuming of course that it's ...."
0,37,22,JACK,"Captain, can we just get on with this?"
0,37,22,SAM,"Right, well I couldn't find any buttons or switches, so unless I've missed something it must be triggered by the handles themselves. I, I think that we should try different ways of grasping the handles. First lets just try grasping it normally, the same way you did before."
0,37,23,JACK,"Nope, still got Junior."
0,37,23,SAM,"Alright, alright, maybe there's an in and an out handle, switch sides."
0,37,24,TEAL'C,We did not make progress.
0,37,24,SAM,"Okay, maybe it has something to do with the order you grab the handles."
0,37,25,JACK,I'm not feeling so hot.
0,37,25,TEAL'C,"What are you feeling, O'Neill?"
0,37,25,JACK,"All of a sudden, Junior's moving around a lot in there."
0,37,25,TEAL'C,This likely means my body has contracted an illness my symbiote must repair.
0,37,25,SAM,"Illness, great."
0,37,25,TEAL'C,It is common. The symbiote will remedy the problem.
0,37,25,JACK,"Okay, when?"
0,37,25,TEAL'C,It can only accomplish its work if you put your body into a state of kel'no'reem.
0,37,25,JACK,"Translation, Teal'c."
0,37,25,TEAL'C,Similar to a state of hibernation.
0,37,25,SAM,Meditation?
0,37,25,TEAL'C,"Perhaps, but I sense much deeper than that of any human mediation. It is imperative that you do this, O'Neill, or my body will be as if it has no immune system."
0,37,25,JACK,"Okay, tell me what to do."
0,37,26,JACK,"You don't look so good, I mean I don't look so good."
0,37,26,TEAL'C,You will become increasingly ill as long as my symbiote does not have the opportunity to make the necessary repair.
0,37,26,JACK,So you're telling me this is just gonna get worse.
0,37,26,TEAL'C,"If you do not perform kel'no'reem it could lead to my death, rather your death."
0,37,26,JACK,What do I do?
0,37,26,TEAL'C,"Please, be seated."
0,37,27,WAITRESS,Can I help you?
0,37,27,MA'CHELLO,"Hello, this is Fred, I am Ma'chello, we wish to feast on me. In fact let everyone here feast on me."
0,37,27,WAITRESS,You celebrating something?
0,37,27,MA'CHELLO,Indeed we are: life.
0,37,27,WAITRESS,"Okay, but I'm going to need a credit card."
0,37,27,MA'CHELLO,"A credit card, where would I find such a card?"
0,37,27,WAITRESS,Usually in your wallet.
0,37,28,MA'CHELLO,Will one of these cards do?
0,37,28,WAITRESS,Absolutely.
0,37,28,MA'CHELLO,"You are one of the most enchanting women I have seen in my lifetime, I would be honoured by a kiss."
0,37,28,WAITRESS,"Yeah, I bet you would."
0,37,29,TEAL'C,"Very good, O'Neill."
0,37,29,JACK,It is? I'm not feeling any better.
0,37,29,TEAL'C,You have not yet reached kel'no'reem.
0,37,29,JACK,"So, how do I do it?"
0,37,29,TEAL'C,"Relax, concentrate, you must imagine the center of your mind and focus. Allow it to take you into a waking sleep, there you will dream, when you do so it will be in harmony with the symbiote. Your sub-conscious minds will be as one. At that moment, you will have achieved kel'no'reem. Here, the symbiote will receive information necessary to repair your sickness."
0,37,30,DANIEL,It's useless.
0,37,30,SAM,"No, it's not, you've already figured out that it's a mixture of ancient Latin and Greek, we're getting closer."
0,37,30,DANIEL,"That's obvious because of the forms, the alphabets may be the same but it's an entirely original language. There's no sentence structure, there's no."
0,37,30,SAM,Take it easy.
0,37,31,JANET,"His blood pressure's going up. He's not responding. Get a CT, check for hemorrhage and get a respirator ready just in case."
0,37,31,SAM,Janet?
0,37,31,JANET,He's non-responsive; he's in a coma.
0,37,32,FRED,"Dig in Ma'chello, before the hot fudge melts all the ice cream. So, I get the feeling you fought in the Gulf, am I right?"
0,37,32,MA'CHELLO,"No. But I was a soldier, I fought many battles, I was captured and tortured."
0,37,32,FRED,"Well, that explains a lot."
0,37,32,MA'CHELLO,"I continued to fight and lost all that I loved and cared for, but I knew I could not surrender, for you. If it were not for me, you would all be conquered by now."
0,37,32,FRED,By who? Sadaam?
0,37,32,MA'CHELLO,"He is not a System Lord I am familiar with, but several others would've wiped you out."
0,37,32,FRED,"Whatever you say, man."
0,37,32,MA'CHELLO,"But I do not wish to fight any longer. From now on I only want to eat hamburgers and French fries and ice cream sundaes and I want to be with good people like you, Fred."
0,37,32,FRED,All good things come to an end Ma'chello.
0,37,32,MA'CHELLO,"No, no my friend, only evil things must come to an end. For good things such as ourselves, it is possible to go on forever."
0,37,32,FRED,Cool.
0,37,33,JACK,"Whoa, Sweet. Teal'c? What are you doing?"
0,37,33,TEAL'C,"If I am to remain in this body, I must shave my head."
0,37,33,JACK,"You're making a joke, right?"
0,37,33,TEAL'C,I am not joking.
0,37,33,JACK,"Teal'c, you will not shave my head."
0,37,33,TEAL'C,"It is presently my head, O'Neill."
0,37,33,JACK,"Teal'c, this is temporary."
0,37,33,TEAL'C,And if it is not?
0,37,33,JACK,"Just give them a chance to find Daniel, okay? Teal'c, I'm going to see General Hammond, promise me, you won't touch, the head, until I get back."
0,37,34,JACK,"Sir, I feel like I need to be involved in finding Daniel."
0,37,34,HAMMONDS,"Well, I think we may have him, Son. Daniel's credit card was just used at a local diner."
0,37,34,JACK,"Request permission to go there, Sir."
0,37,34,HAMMONDS,"Denied, you'll remain here until they bring him in. Be patient, Colonel."
0,37,34,JACK,"I can't be patient. Sir, Daniel is dying and I'd rather we get to Ma'chello than some yahoo civvy-officer shooting him and blowing any chances we have of saving him."
0,37,34,HAMMONDS,"As much as I'd like to, you're not exactly yourself. Request denied."
0,37,35,MA'CHELLO,"It has been a lifetime since I have enjoyed such companionship, Fred. I have truly enjoyed it."
0,37,35,FRED,"Likewise. A woman walks by, she catches Ma'chello's eye."
0,37,35,MA'CHELLO,"How does one court a wife, Fred?"
0,37,35,FRED,"Usually with lots of time, energy and those credit cards."
0,37,35,MA'CHELLO,"Good, let us begin now."
0,37,35,POLICEMAN,"Hold it there, buddy."
0,37,36,MA'CHELLO,"I will not go back, it is impossible."
0,37,36,POLICEMAN,Put your hands behind your head.
0,37,36,FRED,"Do it Ma'chello, you don't know these cops like me."
0,37,37,FRED,"Wait, wait, wait don't shoot him, man, he's a hero.Ah, don't hurt him."
0,37,37,MA'CHELLO,"You were right, Fred, all good things do come to an end."
0,37,39,SAM,"Come on, Daniel, they've found the guy, they're bringing him in; you have to wake up. Daniel, you can't die on me now."
0,37,39,DANIEL,It's nice to know you don't just like me for my looks.
0,37,40,SAM,Hey Janet.
0,37,40,JANET,"Well, it is good to have you back, Doctor Jackson. You have impeccable timing. Sam, they're on their way in, you should get that machine of his in here."
0,37,41,HAMMONDS,Reverse what you've done to my people.
0,37,41,MA'CHELLO,I cannot do what is impossible.
0,37,41,HAMMONDS,Then you won't cooperate.
0,37,41,MA'CHELLO,"On the contrary, I am telling you the truth, it is not possible."
0,37,41,SAM,Why not?
0,37,41,MA'CHELLO,"In simplest terms, the device retains a memory of every transference. For the very reason you're asking me, I designed it to so it encrypts the transference, blocking any reversal."
0,37,41,HAMMONDS,Then reprogram it so it will unblock it.
0,37,41,MA'CHELLO,"You do not have the necessary technology. Even if I wanted to change it, I could not."
0,37,42,MA'CHELLO,Thank you for coming.
0,37,42,SAM,"Hope you're enjoying the scenery, it's the only view you'll have for the rest of your life."
0,37,42,MA'CHELLO,"Yes, that is why I called you; I thought perhaps I might be able to negotiate for better accommodations."
0,37,42,HAMMONDS,We're listening.
0,37,42,MA'CHELLO,First let me apologize for the unfortunate transference of your Colonel and the Jaffa.
0,37,42,HAMMONDS,Just get to the point.
0,37,42,MA'CHELLO,"The symbols you've no doubt tried to decipher are unique, in form they are similar to my native language, but they're actually an original code I devised in case my work came into enemy hands."
0,37,42,HAMMONDS,"We're not your enemy, if anything we're allies."
0,37,42,MA'CHELLO,"That is why I will teach Captain Carter that code. With my knowledge I guarantee you will not only be able to effectively defend yourself against the Goa'uld, you will in fact be able to defeat them."
0,37,42,SAM,And our cost for this knowledge?
0,37,42,MA'CHELLO,"My freedom, of course."
0,37,42,HAMMONDS,And Doctor Jackson?
0,37,42,MA'CHELLO,He is not an issue.
0,37,42,SAM,Not an issue? We're talking about a friend's life.
0,37,42,MA'CHELLO,Your friend was my solution to hiding my face permanently; consider him a casualty of war. I am offering you the salvation of your planet. Is this not worth more than the life of one archaeologist?
0,37,42,HAMMONDS,"I don't know about the customs on your planet, but here on Earth the value of a life is priceless."
0,37,43,SAM,I want you to get to know your casualty.
0,37,44,SAM,I believe you two have met.
0,37,44,DANIEL,"Well from what I can see, you're looking, good."
0,37,44,MA'CHELLO,"What would you like me to say, I am sorry, that I wish I could undo it? I do not."
0,37,44,DANIEL,Why?
0,37,44,MA'CHELLO,"Why? Because I earned it, that's why, I earned it because I sacrificed my life for you and your people. The least you could do is compensate me with another."
0,37,44,DANIEL,What right do you have to judge the value of my life?
0,37,44,MA'CHELLO,"I have suffered, more than anyone should suffer in a lifetime; for 50 years I fought against the Goa'uld then I was betrayed by my wife, whom they secretly turned into a host."
0,37,44,DANIEL,"So is mine, she's still with them."
0,37,44,MA'CHELLO,At least you still have a planet and friends. Two billion of my people died rather than surrender me to the Goa'uld.
0,37,44,DANIEL,"You have made great sacrifices, we owe you gratitude, but still it does not give you the right to take another's life."
0,37,44,MA'CHELLO,"If you had the technology, you would do the same."
0,37,44,DANIEL,"No, I wouldn't, because then I would become no better than the Goa'uld."
0,37,44,MA'CHELLO,"I am not a Goa'uld, I hate the Goa'uld."
0,37,44,DANIEL,"The Goa'uld use host because they think they are better than humans, because they believe they deserve it. You're a Goa'uld Ma'chello. I am nothing but a host to you."
0,37,44,MA'CHELLO,I am not a Goa'uld.
0,37,44,DANIEL,"My wife is still alive, there is a chance I could still save her, you are stealing that chance."
0,37,44,MA'CHELLO,"Even if you still had this body, you will never find her."
0,37,44,DANIEL,"No, I will find her, I will find."
0,37,45,JANET,"He's in de-fib, prepare the paddles. Come on Daniel."
0,37,46,JANET,"Wait a minute; I've got a heartbeat, but I don't know for how long. Give me one mil epi."
0,37,46,MA'CHELLO,"If I could trade places with him again, I would but unfortunately I am the only one who cannot."
0,37,46,SAM,Wait a minute; you're the only who that can't?
0,37,46,MA'CHELLO,Yes.
0,37,46,SAM,Get Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c.
0,37,47,JACK,"What's going on, Captain?"
0,37,47,SAM,I think I may have come up with a solution to this whole mess.
0,37,47,JACK,Finally.
0,37,47,JANET,"Well, whatever you're gonna do, do it fast."
0,37,47,SAM,"Alright, it's a little complicated so I need you to do exactly as I say. We're going to have to play a little musical chairs with your bodies. First Colonel, you and Ma'chello will switch. Trust me, Colonel."
0,37,48,SAM,Colonel?
0,37,48,JACK,I'm here.
0,37,48,SAM,"How do you feel, physically?"
0,37,48,JACK,Peachy.
0,37,48,MA'CHELLO,"The transference was successful, physically we are fine, please continue, Captain."
0,37,48,SAM,"Right, now you and Daniel should switch."
0,37,49,DANIEL,"Whoa, what a dream, what happened?"
0,37,49,SAM,"I don't have time to explain right now, Daniel, just bear with me."
0,37,49,DANIEL,Okay.
0,37,49,JACK,Danny boy.
0,37,49,DANIEL,Jack?
0,37,49,MA'CHELLO,Iwish I had time to teach you the symbols. In your hands my inventions could go on fighting the Goa'uld.
0,37,49,SAM,"It's alright, I'll figure it out, please."
0,37,50,TEAL'C,"I am myself again, thank you Captain Carter."
0,37,50,SAM,Anytime.
0,37,51,JACK,Our turn.
0,37,52,JACK,Yes! Yes! Shave my head?
0,37,52,DANIEL,I'm back.
0,37,52,JANET,He's conscious again.
0,37,52,MA'CHELLO,Thank you for my holiday.
0,37,52,DANIEL,You're welcome
0,37,53,HAMMONDS,"Welcome back, SG-1."
