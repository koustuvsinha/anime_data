0,38,0,"""SERPENTS SONG""",By Katharyn Michaelian Powers Offworld
0,38,2,DANIEL,Shouldn't they be here by now?
0,38,2,JACK,Yes.
0,38,2,TEAL'C,I do not believe the Tok'ra would mislead us.
0,38,2,DANIEL,"Well, assuming it was the Tok'ra who sent us the message to meet them here in the first place. I mean all we really received was a set of co-ordinates."
0,38,2,SAM,"But on our radio frequencies, who else would send us a signal like that"
0,38,2,JACK,"You know I'm not really too crazy about, this don't call us we'll call you policy."
0,38,2,TEAL'C,There!
0,38,3,JACK,Cover up!!
0,38,4,JACK,Holy Buckets
0,38,4,APOPHIS,help me.
0,38,5,JACK,Well.
0,38,5,DANIEL,Wow! Is that who I think it is?
0,38,5,APOPHIS,Tau'ri please
0,38,6,SAM,Teal'c! Apophis is much more valuable to us alive than dead.
0,38,7,SAM,Sir. We've got incoming.
0,38,8,JACK,"Oy. Alright, Dial us up, get us out of here!"
0,38,8,SAM,What are they doing?
0,38,8,TEAL'C,They wish to take Apophis alive.
0,38,10,HAMMOND,Colonel?
0,38,10,JACK,General Hammond.... Apophis. Apophis. General Hammond.
0,38,10,HAMMOND,We've met.
0,38,10,APOPHIS,I demand Kel'mac!
0,38,11,DANIEL,I'm not really sure but I think what he's asking for is...
0,38,11,TEAL'C,Sanctuary.
0,38,11,DANIEL,Right.
0,38,11,HAMMOND,Why?
0,38,11,JACK,I think some rival Goa'uld just kicked his ass.
0,38,11,SAM,"There were several other death gliders in pursuit when we took him prisoner, sir."
0,38,11,APOPHIS,I demand Kel'mac
0,38,11,HAMMOND,"You're not in a position to demand anything, sir. Lock him up."
0,38,11,JANET,"Sir, with all due respect, he is badly injured he is not going to be any use to you if we don't get him to the OR right now."
0,38,11,HAMMOND,Do what you need to keep him alive doctor. We got a lot of questions that need answers.
0,38,11,JANET,Yes sir. OK lets move him. Let him start on two IV's and I wanna run ringer's lactate wide open. Lets go.
0,38,11,HAMMOND,"I want four SF's posted at all times, if he attempts to escape, you're authorized to do what ever is necessary to stop him."
0,38,11,HAMMOND,We'll debrief at 1100hrs.
0,38,11,JACK,Yes sir.
0,38,13,JANET,"Both femurs were smashed and there was eternal bleeding, Surgery and transfusions have stabilized him for now."
0,38,14,TEAL'C,The Goa'uld symbiote within him will repair those injuries
0,38,14,JANET,"Well, I think it's kept him alive so far Teal'c. but take a look at his monitors. See what you're looking at is the actual symbiote attached to the Hosts brainstem. Have you seen these lesions? I mean these dozens of them. I can treat the Human part but as for the symbiote itself."
0,38,14,SAM,There is no treatment. He's been tortured.
0,38,15,JACK,Sam?
0,38,15,SAM,"I just had a memory of Jolinar in pain, when she was killed by the Ashrak.The ashrak had this device. He used it on us. It was used to cause incredible pain. Apophis was tortured by the same thing."
0,38,16,HAMMOND,So he's dying.
0,38,16,JANET,Yes sir
0,38,16,HAMMOND,you're sure about this?
0,38,16,JANET,As sure as I can be sir. Considering what we know of Goa'uld physiology.
0,38,16,JACK,Good. When?
0,38,16,JANET,"Without access to a sarcoughacus the Goa'uld body will continue to deteriorate, we're looking at days, weeks certainly."
0,38,16,SAM,"This kind of torture wasn't designed to extract information, it's a method of execution."
0,38,16,JACK,So what does he want?
0,38,16,DANIEL,"You heard him yourself, he wants sanctuary."
0,38,16,JACK,I'm not buying that.
0,38,16,DANIEL,"He gambled that we would show compassion even to our worst enemy, and he was right."
0,38,16,JACK,You think he orchestrated this. Let me tell you something. The only compassion I showed was not blowing his head off.
0,38,16,TEAL'C,"I have witnessed once powerful Goa'uld enter the service of their conquerors in exchange for life. When Apophis himself, was a conqueror it gave him great pleasure to see his enemy so weakened."
0,38,16,SAM,But we're along way from being his conquerors.
0,38,16,TEAL'C,But we are greatly responsible for his downfall.
0,38,16,HAMMOND,He lost an Army when you destroyed those two ships in orbit.
0,38,16,SAM,Bra'tac did say that that seriously weakened his place amongst the Goa'uld.
0,38,16,DANIEL,So his blood is in the water and all the other sharks are having a feeding frenzy.
0,38,16,TEAL'C,And he has come here seeking refuge.
0,38,16,JACK,"Well, that's tough. I say we beat any information we can out of old snake boy and toss him back to the sharks."
0,38,16,HAMMOND,Not so fast colonel. He's essentially a prisoner of war. That gives him certain rights.
0,38,16,JACK,"Rights, General?"
0,38,16,SAM,"We also have to consider the host, I'm sorry sir but we are dealing with two beings within one body. The symbiote may be an enemy but the host is innocent."
0,38,16,JACK,"Oh, come on, how much of the host do you think is still around after all this time."
0,38,16,TEAL'C,Apophis will have that knowledge.
0,38,16,HAMMOND,We also need to consider military intelligence. I have informed my superiors about our situation. My orders are to extract whatever information we can in the short time we may have.
0,38,16,TEAL'C,He will tell you nothing of use General Hammond.
0,38,16,HAMMOND,If he believes it's in his own interest he might.
0,38,16,DANIEL,We are the only thing that stands between him and whatever Goa'uld is after him on that planet.
0,38,16,HAMMOND,We need answers. Let me know when he's conscious.
0,38,16,JANET,I'll inform you the moment he's ready for questioning sir.
0,38,16,HAMMOND,Dismissed.
0,38,16,SAM,Sir?
0,38,16,JACK,Should of shot him.
0,38,17,JACK,Dr. Frasier. He's awake.
0,38,18,JACK,Don't get too close doc.
0,38,18,JANET,He's not strong enough to do anything to hurt me colonel. He wants to talk to you.
0,38,19,JANET,He asked to speak to you by name.
0,38,19,APOPHIS,O'Neill I am dying.
0,38,19,JACK,My heart bleeds for you.
0,38,19,APOPHIS,You lie poorly. It is you who have done this. You rejoice.
0,38,19,JACK,Not really. What do you want?
0,38,19,APOPHIS,To live.
0,38,19,JACK,Can't help you out there. That's between you and your God.Oh wait a minute. You are your God. That's a problem.
0,38,19,APOPHIS,I'm worth far more to you than you will admit.
0,38,19,JACK,You tell me what are you worth?
0,38,19,APOPHIS,You are still primitive you will be destroyed.
0,38,19,JACK,You don't look like you're up to it.
0,38,19,APOPHIS,Not me. There is another
0,38,19,JACK,Yeah. Who?
0,38,19,APOPHIS,There is much you will learn from me Tau'ri. For that knowledge there is a price. A new host.
0,38,19,JACK,A host?
0,38,19,APOPHIS,"So that I may live, in exchange for all the knowledge of the Goa'uld, secrets of star travel, weapons, our power."
0,38,19,JACK,All that?
0,38,19,APOPHIS,in time more.
0,38,19,JACK,Go to Hell
0,38,19,APOPHIS,A sake of a human life is worth so much. You would risk a world.
0,38,19,JACK,That's right. That's why they call us the good guys. Doc. let me know when he dies.
0,38,19,APOPHIS,Sokar
0,38,19,JACK,What?
0,38,19,APOPHIS,"An ancient and powerful Goa'uld. You have helped him to be come strong. Last of my loyal Jaffa died stealing me from his grasp. He will not rest until I am found, that is why I came here. So that in death I can be assured that you can die with me."
0,38,20,TEAL'C,Sokar is a Goa'uld of ancient times. He once was ruler of the system lords but was defeated by an alliance of Goa'uld many centuries ago. Apophis and Ra were among his conquerors.
0,38,20,SAM,Where did he go?
0,38,20,TEAL'C,"Apophis himself believed him destroyed, but obviously he was mistaken."
0,38,20,JACK,"Well, if he was almost wiped out how bad could he be now."
0,38,20,JACK,Its rhetorical Teal'c.
0,38,20,DANIEL,"His names also very old in Earth mythology. He was the most feared deity in ancient Egypt, the original God of Death."
0,38,20,JACK,Got anything a little more up to date.
0,38,20,DANIEL,"Well, I don't know what he's been up to lately, but according to the book of the dead, there was a time he ruled all of Earth, his land around menthes were covered by darkness and inhabited by serpents."
0,38,20,TEAL'C,Unas. The first host of the Goa'uld.
0,38,20,DANIEL,"Well that makes sense. I mean if the Unas were the first ones then there had to be a time when both form of Goa'uld host co- existed, Unas and Human. Kind of like Neanderthals."
0,38,20,JACK,Which is he?
0,38,20,DANIEL,"I don't know, but his portion of tuat or the other world was filled with lakes of fire, the wicked were thrown into his punishment after torture and mutilation."
0,38,20,JACK,Hell
0,38,20,DANIEL,Yeah. Basically he was the original Satan.
0,38,20,JACK,Isn't that special?
0,38,21,JACK,Speak of the devil.
0,38,22,HAMMOND,Have they sent a signal.
0,38,22,SIMMONS,"There are no units currently onboard, Sir."
0,38,22,HAMMOND,Close the Iris
0,38,22,SIMMONS,Sir.
0,38,23,HAMMOND,Is there anyway to determine what that was?
0,38,23,SAM,Yes sir. We can get a radiation team in there to check the decay signature on the iris.
0,38,23,SIMMONS,I'm on it Captain. Radiation team to Gateroom.
0,38,23,JACK,"In the mean time sir, I'd like to get back to the interrogation if I may."
0,38,23,HAMMOND,Ok.
0,38,23,DANIEL,"Sir I'm kind of the resident on Sokar around here, I'd like a shot at the interrogation."
0,38,23,JACK,Yeah ok.
0,38,24,DANIEL,Is he Conscious?
0,38,24,APOPHIS,Come Daniel.
0,38,24,DANIEL,You know my name?
0,38,24,APOPHIS,Because of what we hold in common. Amaunet my queen.
0,38,24,DANIEL,Her name is Sha're. She is my wife.
0,38,24,APOPHIS,They are one in the same.
0,38,24,DANIEL,Amounet possesses her. Sha're is a Prisoner. She is somewhere I want you to tell me where.
0,38,24,APOPHIS,"Amaunet, I loved her You do not believe me."
0,38,24,DANIEL,No. I don't think that's possible.
0,38,24,APOPHIS,"How could you, her eyes, her knowledge, Our very being is so much greater, so much more."
0,38,24,DANIEL,I know where your child is.
0,38,24,APOPHIS,My son.
0,38,24,DANIEL,Yes I brought him into the world with my own hands on Abydos.
0,38,24,APOPHIS,He was taken by Her'ur
0,38,24,DANIEL,"No, by me."
0,38,24,APOPHIS,"We have no use for the child now. Amounet, I knew from the moment I laid eyes on her, she was a vessel for the queen"
0,38,24,DANIEL,If you don't tell me where she is. I'll kill you right here.
0,38,24,APOPHIS,You have neither the strength nor the will.
0,38,24,SAM,Daniel.
0,38,25,SAM,"we...we think that thud we heard hitting the iris was the saving box, Its radioactive signature matches the one we gave the Tok'ra. They're coming here."
0,38,26,SIMMONS,Incoming travelelr
0,38,26,JACK,Decision time sir.
0,38,26,HAMMOND,Captain Carter are you 100% certain.
0,38,26,SAM,That the signature matches the Tok'ra? Yes sir. That it came from them? Theres no way to be sure.
0,38,26,HAMMOND,What if one or more of the Tok'ra have been captured by Sokar and Tortured.
0,38,26,SAM,I don't think that they would give us up.
0,38,26,JACK,"I'm with Carter, General, I say we keep the door open."
0,38,26,HAMMOND,Very well.
0,38,27,MARTOUF,Samantha
0,38,27,SAM,Martouf.
0,38,27,HAMMOND,Defense team you may stand down.
0,38,27,MARTOUF,I offer you greetings from the high council of the Tok'ra.
0,38,27,SAM,Why didn't my father come?
0,38,27,MARTOUF,He's dealing with more urgent matters. We come only to offer you a word of warning.
0,38,27,JACK,Which is?
0,38,27,MARTOUF,We know you have Apophis as your prisoner. You must return him to the planet you retrieved him from immediately.
0,38,28,MARTOUF,"Since Jacob has joined the Tok'ra I have come to a deeper understanding of your people, the purpose and your extraordinary gifts."
0,38,28,HAMMOND,Thank you.
0,38,28,MARTOUF,You've shown great skill and cunning in retrieving Apophis from the hands of Sokar. However...
0,38,28,JACK,"You know as much as I love where you're going with this, we didn't exactly do that."
0,38,28,MARTOUF,Our operatives aboard Sokars vessel witnessed you leave the crash site and enter the Stargate.
0,38,28,SAM,"We received a signal a set of co-ordinates, we had thought it came from you."
0,38,28,MARTOUF,We sent no such signal.
0,38,28,JACK,We know that now.
0,38,28,MARTOUF,Then who?
0,38,28,JACK,We're going to assume it was Apophis.
0,38,28,MARTOUF/LANTESH,Why would he take refuge among the Tau'ri? He despises you. More than that you have nothing of use to him.
0,38,28,JACK,He's going down. He wants to take us with him.
0,38,28,LANTESH,He has taken advantage of your weakness.
0,38,28,SAM,We don't consider what we did a sign of weakness.
0,38,28,LANTESH,Then you are fools. Turn him over to Sokar now. That he may spare you.
0,38,28,HAMMOND,We can't do that just yet
0,38,28,LANTESH,"If he remains here, you will all die. if not by the hand of sokar then by the many Goa'uld who would wish to destroy Apophis themselves. You do not see what you have done. You have entered a battle in which you are ill equipped to fight. Tipped the balance of power among the Goa'uld and in so doing worsened the fortune of your entire race."
0,38,28,HAMMOND,We must know what would happen to him if we turned him over.
0,38,28,LANTESH,I'm certain he would be executed eventually
0,38,28,HAMMOND,I see.
0,38,28,LANTESH,"surely, you welcome this. His guilt is clear. He cannot be allowed to escape punishment."
0,38,28,JANET,He won't. He's dying.
0,38,28,LANTESH,You are certain of this.
0,38,28,JANET,Yes. His body has begun to age in an increasing rate.
0,38,28,LANTESH,Without a sarcaphagous to rejuvenate him of course.
0,38,28,HAMMOND,In the short time he has remaining. We may yet learn information to aid ourselves.
0,38,28,LANTESH,The knowledge and Technology are too primitive for any information to be of any use. Why don't you comprehend the danger you are in? We cannot defend you from the Goa'uld. You cannot expect us too.
0,38,28,JACK,We don't.
0,38,28,LANTESH,Overconfidence was their failing O'Neill. I hope it has not become yours.
0,38,28,LANTESH/MARTOUF,"Forgive Lantesh. He is sometimes passionate in his opinions. We cannot and would not force you to do anything, but since we have not convinced you of the danger you face may we see him?"
0,38,29,MARTOUF,What is that you are injecting into his body?
0,38,29,JANET,Morphine sulphate.
0,38,29,SAM,To ease the pain.
0,38,29,MARTOUF,Yes you said he had been tortured.
0,38,29,JANET,He is also experiencing withdrawal symptoms from the Sarcaphagous.
0,38,29,MARTOUF,But he is your enemy.
0,38,29,JANET,He is my patient.
0,38,29,APOPHIS,Amaunet.
0,38,29,MARTOUF,Apophis hear me.
0,38,29,APOPHIS,Amaunet
0,38,29,MARTOUF,I would speak with you
0,38,29,APOPHIS,Amaunet! My love.
0,38,29,APOPHIS,Where are you?
0,38,30,HOST,shemoie shemoie
0,38,30,DANIEL,That's ancient Egyptian. This must be the host.
0,38,30,HOST,Shimotay shimotay
0,38,30,JACK,Talk to him.
0,38,30,DANIEL,I don't know what to say.
0,38,31,DANIEL,Thousands of years trapped inside your own body. Its like a nightmare. It's Unimaginable.
0,38,31,JANET,He won't be conscious again for a while.
0,38,31,MARTOUF,Then we will take our leave of you. I will tell you the co-ordinates to send us.
0,38,31,SAM,We can question him together. We can share whatever information we can get.
0,38,32,JACK,Expecting someone?
0,38,32,MARTOUF,No.
0,38,33,SIMMONS,Defense team stand by.
0,38,33,HAMMOND,Keep that Iris closed.
0,38,33,SIMMONS,Yes sir.
0,38,34,MARTOUF,Sokar has found you.
0,38,34,JACK,How?
0,38,34,MARTOUF,His pilots saw your kind flee with Apophis through the Chappa'ia. Symbols of the Tau'ri are well known among the Goa'uld.
0,38,34,JACK,That Iris will hold.
0,38,34,SAM,It's a Trinium Titanium alloy just a few microns from the event horizon. It won't allow matter to reintegrate.
0,38,34,TEAL'C,Something is appearing.
0,38,35,SAM,How is this possible?
0,38,35,MARTOUF,The space between your metal barrier and the wormhole may be enough for particles of extremely high energy to reintegrate.
0,38,35,SAM,Subatomic particles?
0,38,35,MARTOUF,Yes.
0,38,35,SAM,Are you saying he's firing a particle accelerator at the wormhole?
0,38,35,HAMMOND,Captain?
0,38,35,SAM,"Sir, we may be witnessing the decay of subatomic particles as they're being bombarded against the Iris. Small enough to reintegrate but moving at nearly light velocity. Sokar can modulate the particle stream enough to create an actual image."
0,38,35,SOKAR,People of the Tau'ri you have taken what is mine. For this you will be destroyed.
0,38,35,SIMMONS,The iris is beginning to heat up sir.
0,38,35,HAMMOND,How long can they maintain this?
0,38,35,SAM,"The longest single Goa'uld attack against the iris was 38 minutes, we think that's the maximum a wormhole can be maintained before collapsing."
0,38,35,DANIEL,They're just going to dial us up and do all of this all over again.
0,38,35,HAMMOND,This changes things. I better get on the phone with the president.
0,38,35,SAM,Can you help us?
0,38,35,MARTOUF,I know of no way
0,38,35,JACK,"Alright in the mean time, Carter why don't you see what you can get out of Apophis. His necks on the line here now too."
0,38,35,SAM,Yes sir.
0,38,35,TEAL'C,I will accompany you.
0,38,36,APOPHIS,I will not speak to the Shol'va
0,38,36,SAM,Just answer this. Sokar is firing some sort of particle beam at the barrier we've placed within our stargate. How do we defend against it?
0,38,36,APOPHIS,There is no defense.
0,38,36,TEAL'C,He lies.
0,38,36,APOPHIS,Shol'va kree.
0,38,36,SAM,How can you be so sure?
0,38,36,APOPHIS,Because he used the weapon against me.
0,38,36,SAM,We're not going to get anything out of him in this state. I'll get Dr. Frasier.
0,38,37,TEAL'C,I have waited many years for this moment.
0,38,37,APOPHIS,Do you think you have won Teal'c. You are about to die.
0,38,37,TEAL'C,Perhaps that is so. But my People have won freedom.
0,38,37,APOPHIS,The Jaffa will never be free.
0,38,37,TEAL'C,"They are free even now, as am I. Here me Apophis. This day will become a holy day on Chulak. The day of your death."
0,38,37,APOPHIS,The larval Goa'uld you carry within you is your master even now. All of you. When the time comes for those children to take a host you will die.
0,38,37,TEAL'C,Then we will find other symbiote to survive upon. Then disgard them when they are mature. We will use your kind as you have used mine.
0,38,37,APOPHIS,No.
0,38,37,TEAL'C,The people of chulak no longer worship you. They no longer fear you. The time of Apophis has finally come to an end.
0,38,37,APOPHIS,The kill me now.
0,38,37,TEAL'C,Tell us how to defend ourselves against this weapon.
0,38,37,APOPHIS,I will die with a smile on my lips. Knowing you will die along with me shol'va.
0,38,37,TEAL'C,"Come no further. Let him suffer and when he can stand the pain no more, he will tell us how to defend ourselves against sokars weapon."
0,38,37,JANET,Teal'c. please move.
0,38,37,APOPHIS,There was a time when you would die for me Teal'c.
0,38,37,TEAL'C,That time is no more.
0,38,37,APOPHIS,AAgghh!
0,38,37,JANET,Easy. Easy.
0,38,37,SAM,"Alright these shields of yours, they obviously absorb different forms of energy maybe we could......"
0,38,37,APOPHIS,I sense a presence within you.
0,38,37,SAM,Could your shields help us or not?
0,38,37,APOPHIS,You were once possessed by a Goa'uld. I'm sure you would make an excellent host for sokar's new queen.
0,38,38,HAMMOND,Airman. More on Sergeant. It's getting damn hot in here.
0,38,38,SILER,Better than nothing sir. Not by much.
0,38,39,JACK,Sir. Daniel just came up with an idea that might by us some time.
0,38,39,DANIEL,"Sir, if we can dial out, we can prevent them from dialing in from as long as we can keep the Gate open"
0,38,39,HAMMOND,Good thinking Doctor. If we can keep our gate open for the same link of time
0,38,39,SIMMONS,Coming up to 38 minutes sir.
0,38,39,JACK,Stand by.
0,38,39,JACK,Yes sir.
0,38,40,JACK,
0,38,40,SIMMONS,"Chevron one encoded,Chevron two encoded"
0,38,40,DANIEL,The only thing I'm worried about is that...
0,38,41,SIMMONS,Incoming wormhole established.
0,38,41,DANIEL,Sokar can dial in faster than we can dial out.
0,38,41,SIMMONS,Sorry sir. Next window is 38 minutes away.
0,38,41,DANIEL,That may be our last chance to dial out.
0,38,41,JACK,Its gonna get hot sir.
0,38,42,HAMMOND,"The temperature in the Gateroom now reads 130 degrees Fahrenheit, which means the iris must be six or eight times that."
0,38,42,MARTOUF,Even if he fails to breech the Gate. He will come by ship.
0,38,42,SAM,"Martouf is right, what we really need to be concerned with here is another assault from space. That's exactly what we're inviting by refusing to hand Apophis over."
0,38,42,DANIEL,"Well, we couldn't right now even if we wanted to."
0,38,42,JACK,Not with bielzeebub banging at the door. No.
0,38,42,HAMMOND,I've informed the president of our new situation. Our new orders are to cease all medical intervention.
0,38,42,JANET,"That will affectively end his life, General."
0,38,42,HAMMOND,I'm aware of that doctor. The president and Joint-chiefs have decided that the risks are too great not to heed the Tok'ra's warning. Our orders are to send Apophis' body back through the gate to the co-ordinates where you found him.
0,38,42,TEAL'C,"Will that be sufficient to make Sokar cease his attack, Martouf?"
0,38,42,MARTOUF,"Sokar is at war with Her'ur, he wants no part of the Tau'ri for the moment, but you may have come to your senses to late. He will soon burn through your iris."
0,38,42,SAM,"Well, I've been working on a way to dial out faster. If we can open our gate in the next window we should be able to send Apophis through."
0,38,42,JACK,When is that?
0,38,42,SAM,17 minutes.
0,38,42,HAMMOND,"Colonel, Make arrangements to send Apophis back through the Stargate."
0,38,43,JACK,Apophis. We're sending you back.
0,38,43,HOST,Shimotay. Shimotay
0,38,43,JACK,Get Doctor Jackson down here.
0,38,44,HAMMOND,I can't keep those men in there much longer.
0,38,44,SAM,They've got to stay until the next window sir.
0,38,46,DANIEL,"He says he's been in a never ending dream, he hoped to waken from it, to see his wife and his children."
0,38,47,DANIEL,"He was a scribe in the temple of almoun in cardak, but that was another life time ago, before the...before the nightmare."
0,38,48,DANIEL,"And now he awakens only to die again. Nomka yaydei a tou, pomra dunaray epia desipo gosofkaa eia kemota shalpell. Sheak anuson. Heyho. Heyho. I said I will speak the words of power and renew the rights. He will be returned to Egypt and buried with honour. He will pass through the seven gates and see his wife and children again and rejoice with them forever. I'll be back."
0,38,49,SIMMONS,"Sir we're going to lose the computers, the heat."
0,38,49,HAMMOND,Captain?
0,38,49,SAM,We need them sir one more minute until the window.
0,38,50,APOPHIS,help me.
0,38,50,JACK,No.
0,38,50,APOPHIS,A host.
0,38,50,JACK,No.
0,38,50,APOPHIS,I am afraid.
0,38,50,JANET,Colonel
0,38,51,JANET,"The Goa'uld is dead, but the host is still alive."
0,38,52,SAM,That's it initiate the dialing program
0,38,52,SIMMONS,Cheveron 1.
0,38,53,DANIEL,"I told him this funerary statue, will take his last breath and carrie it back to Egypt."
0,38,54,TECH,Cheveron 5 is encoded.
0,38,56,TECH,Cheveron 6 encoded.
0,38,56,CHEVERON 7 LOCKED.,
0,38,57,SIMMONS,Wormhole established.
0,38,57,HAMMOND,Open the Iris.
0,38,58,TEAL'C,Captain Carter has succeeded in creating an outgoing wormhole. Sokar cannot attack during this time.
0,38,58,JACK,That's good.
0,38,59,DANIEL,What now?
0,38,59,JACK,We Wait.
0,38,59,SAM,If Sokar wanted him alive then he'll just start up the attack again.
0,38,59,MARTOUF,"No. I don't believe he will, Sokar has a sarcaphagous in his possession. With it he can revive Apophis even through death and torture him as long as he pleases. Surely a fate he justly deserves"
0,38,60,MARTOUF,These are the Co-ordinates we would like you send us.
0,38,60,SAM,But not to anywhere we'll be able to find you again.
0,38,60,MARTOUF,"To contact us, you may use this."
0,38,60,DANIEL,That's Tollan. They used it to contact the Nox.
0,38,60,MARTOUF,"Yes, We are friends of the Tollan, and we are friends of the Tau'ri."
0,38,60,SAM,Thank you.
0,38,60,JACK,"well, if we're going to be friends, you're going to need one of these. Its called a G D O, Sends out a signal to let us know who you are and if its ok to open the iris, otherwise you could end up splattered against the wall."
0,38,60,MARTOUF,I understand.
0,38,60,SAM,Come on I'll show you how it works.
0,38,60,HAMMOND,Alright lets send them home people.
