0,43,0,"""INTO THE FIRE""",By Brad Wright
0,43,1,SERGEANT,Welcome back Colonel MAKEPEACE. Your briefing is scheduled for 14.30 hours.
0,43,1,MAKEPEACE,Make a hole! I need to find General HAMMOND!
0,43,1,SERGEANT,He's in his office.
0,43,3,HAMMOND,"What we need is support for three new teams. It's a big galaxy out there, Major."
0,43,4,MAKEPEACE,Sir!
0,43,4,HAMMOND,"Colonel MAKEPEACE, I'm sure you remember Major DAVIS."
0,43,4,MAKEPEACE,"Yes Sir, I apologize. When scouting 254, Sir, we came across several members of the Tok'ra. They told us the location of SG1."
0,43,4,HAMMOND,"Where are they, Colonel?"
0,43,4,MAKEPEACE,They've been taken prisoner Sir.by HATHOR.
0,43,5,HAMMOND,"Colonel, why do I get the feeling I'm looking at blueprints to my own base?"
0,43,5,MAKEPEACE,"Well in a way you are, Sir. The entire section of the facility is a mock-up of the SGC."
0,43,5,HAMMOND,It's damned peculiar.
0,43,5,MAKEPEACE,"Well unlike Cheyenne Mountain, the Tok'ra say the exterior of the base is unguarded. We shouldn't face any resistance until we're already in the facility, and even then it will be light."
0,43,5,DAVIS,Can we trust them? The.Tok'ra?
0,43,5,MAKEPEACE,"Their operative on the inside took a big risk just to get us this information, Sir. I think so."
0,43,5,DAVIS,"If they have someone on the inside, why can't they do something?"
0,43,5,HAMMOND,"They did do something, Major. You have the coordinates?"
0,43,5,MAKEPEACE,Yes Sir. My team is ready to go.
0,43,5,HAMMOND,"And you will, but not alone. SERGEANT, I'd like you to get me the President on the phone."
0,43,5,SERGEANT,Yes Sir.
0,43,5,HAMMOND,I want every available SG team ready to deploy in the Gateroom within 2 hours.
0,43,5,MAKEPEACE,Yes Sir.
0,43,5,DAVIS,"Sir, do you intend to commit the resources of this entire command?"
0,43,5,HAMMOND,I only wish we could. Nearly half of our teams are off world right now on other missions.
0,43,5,DAVIS,"General, that's not my point. SG1 is a valuable asset, but they're still just one team."
0,43,5,HAMMOND,"Major, you've got a lot to learn about how we do things round here."
0,43,5,SERGEANT,"I have the President for you, Sir."
0,43,5,HAMMOND,Let's get the job done.
0,43,6,TECHNICIAN,".telemetry, tactical is go. Environmental is go."
0,43,7,HAMMOND,"You've all been briefed on the mission by Colonel MAKEPEACE. You know the enemy, you know the risks. What I'm trying to say is, I would rather not order you to do this. So, I would like all of those willing to attempt a rescue of SG1 to take one step."
0,43,8,HAMMOND,"Very well. SG units three, five, six and eleven.bring them home."
0,43,9,HAMMOND,Good luck Colonel.
0,43,9,MAKEPEACE,"Yes Sir. Alright let's go, move out!"
0,43,10,HATHOR,We ask you once more. Which one of you shall be host to our new friend?
0,43,10,O'NEILL,He has her eyes.
0,43,10,HATHOR,Silence! Shall it be.our Beloved? We could spend an eternity together. Do you not remember the joys that we once shared in one another's arms?
0,43,10,DANIEL,I really try not to.
0,43,10,HATHOR,"Shall it be the female then? She who would challenge us? You have since been possessed by a Goa'uld, we sense. Perhaps once more?"
0,43,10,CARTER,I'm not afraid.
0,43,10,HATHOR,"You should be, my dear, for the pain a symbiote can inflict in its host is unimaginable."
0,43,11,HATHOR,It seems that our friend has chosen.
0,43,11,O'NEILL,"What, the grey doesn't bother you? Alright, fine, let's do it. Just, please, I beg of you, not in the back of the neck, I've got some problems."
0,43,12,HATHOR,Fool!
0,43,12,RALEIGH,He would have harmed the symbiote.
0,43,12,HATHOR,Which you have done in his place! Return it to the safety of the Jaffa. Take him somewhere where he can be properly restrained.
0,43,12,MAKEPEACE,"Alright, hold the fort."
0,43,12,MARINE,Yes Sir.
0,43,13,MAKEPEACE,What have you got?
0,43,13,LIEUTENANT,"Picking up EM approximately one click away, Sir. Probably power generation. No sign of SG1's IFM or radio chatter."
0,43,13,MAKEPEACE,"Roger that, LIEUTENANT."
0,43,14,BRA'TAC,
0,43,14,TEAL'C,Do not speak of such things.
0,43,15,TEAL'C,Who has done this?
0,43,15,BRA'TAC,The last of APOPHIS' personal guard. They left me for dead.
0,43,15,TEAL'C,For what reason?
0,43,15,BRA'TAC,"When I heard the new of APOPHIS, my heart soared TEAL'C. I hoped there would be celebration among our people. Instead, they fear that with the death of APOPHIS, KLOREL will return to claim his inheritance."
0,43,15,TEAL'C,They are cowards.
0,43,15,BRA'TAC,In too great a number for an old man of 135. What of your human friends?
0,43,15,TEAL'C,Prisoners of a Goa'uld. I have come to raise an army with which to free them.
0,43,15,BRA'TAC,"That will not be so easy, TEAL'C."
0,43,15,TEAL'C,"Perhaps. But I must try. Until then, you are in need of food and rest. And I am in need of armor."
0,43,16,HATHOR,We are not pleased.
0,43,16,O'NEILL,Neither are we.
0,43,16,HATHOR,"Once host to a Goa'uld, you will take the lives of your friends."
0,43,16,O'NEILL,We don't think so.
0,43,16,HATHOR,You will have no say in the matter. You will witness their deaths through your own eyes.helplessly. It may take some time for the Goa'uld to take control. But we will greatly enjoy experiencing your eventual defeat.
0,43,16,O'NEILL,"Oh god, no."
0,43,16,HATHOR,"And when you awaken from the joining, you will kneel and pledge your loyalty to us."
0,43,17,O'NEILL,God!
0,43,18,HATHOR,"Jaffa, kree'mel!"
0,43,20,MAKEPEACE,"Over there, over there! Secure the forward area."
0,43,20,HATHOR,"Jaffa, lok shak kelmak a kree!"
0,43,21,RALEIGH,
0,43,23,MAKEPEACE,"Three o'clock, three o'clock!"
0,43,24,MAKEPEACE,"Yeah, there's no place like home. Alright, area secured. Let's move out!"
0,43,25,MAKEPEACE,Surrender you prisoners and drop your weapon. Now!
0,43,26,CARTER,Colonel MAKEPEACE.
0,43,26,MAKEPEACE,Where's Colonel O'NEILL?
0,43,26,CARTER,He's been taken as a host.
0,43,26,MAKEPEACE,What?
0,43,27,HATHOR,Jaffa kree!
0,43,27,RALEIGH,"Kel'noc shree Jaffa! I am of the Tok'ra. If the Tau'ri do not destroy you, know this.we will!"
0,43,29,MARINE,"All secure here, Sir. Whenever you're ready."
0,43,29,MAKEPEACE,Stand by. We're pulling out. ETA is 5 minutes.
0,43,30,MARINE,"Sir, there's something happening back here!"
0,43,30,MAKEPEACE,"Razor, come in Razor. SG3 we have lost radio contact, please respond."
0,43,30,CARTER,What's the situation?
0,43,30,MAKEPEACE,"My team was covering the STARGATE. LIEUTENANT, pass the word, we' re moving out."
0,43,30,DANIEL,Wait! What about Jack?
0,43,30,MAKEPEACE,He's a casualty.
0,43,30,CARTER,"Sir, if we can get him back to Earth."
0,43,30,MAKEPEACE,"Captain, if my team has lost control of the STARGATE, we're not going anywhere. Now let's go people. We're pulling out, let's go!"
0,43,31,PRIESTESS,"I know you. Shova, you dare return to Chulak?"
0,43,31,TEAL'C,The people of this world are my brothers and sisters. I have betrayed no one.
0,43,31,PRIESTESS,Except your god.
0,43,31,TEAL'C,"False god. Dead, false god."
0,43,31,PRIESTESS,So you say. But his son lives.
0,43,31,TEAL'C,"With you or without, he will be defeated, as was his father. Our people will taste freedom."
0,43,31,PRIESTESS,
0,43,32,TEAL'C,"You may tell your kinsmen that TEAL'C has returned to Chulak! You will go to every home, of every warrior in this city. You will tell them that I will speak at the house of BRA'TAC at dawn. Summon them!"
0,43,34,MAKEPEACE,No sign of my men.
0,43,34,CARTER,Or the enemy.
0,43,35,MAKEPEACE,Cover your flank! Open fire!
0,43,36,MAKEPEACE,What the hell is it?
0,43,36,CARTER,It's an energy barrier. We won't penetrate it.
0,43,36,TROFSKY,"Jaffa, ha'tak."
0,43,36,MAKEPEACE,Fall back! Fall back! Into the tree line!
0,43,37,CARTER,
0,43,37,MAKEPEACE,"This way, this way! To me!"
0,43,38,MAKEPEACE,"Secure that flank, secure that flank! Is anybody behind you?"
0,43,38,SOLDIER,No!
0,43,38,CARTER,These are Tok'ra tunnels.
0,43,38,MAKEPEACE,They have an operative on the inside.
0,43,38,CARTER,Who is it?
0,43,38,MAKEPEACE,"Don't know, don't expect to find out anytime soon either. How's the leg.can you walk?"
0,43,38,DANIEL,"It's just a deep, bleeding gash, but it'll be fine."
0,43,38,MAKEPEACE,"Sierra Gulf Six, Sierra Gulf Six, this is Three Niner, come in."
0,43,38,CARTER,They could have made the tree line.
0,43,38,MAKEPEACE,"Yeah, maybe."
0,43,38,CARTER,"If we can't penetrate this barrier of theirs, maybe we can go under it."
0,43,38,MAKEPEACE,It's worth a try.
0,43,39,TROFSKY,They have fled into tunnels of Tok'ra construction. There must be a spy amongst us.
0,43,39,HATHOR,The Tok'ra spy has been taken care of. Take as many of the humans as you can alive. They will make an excellent addition to our new army of Jaffa.
0,43,40,DANIEL,Well I guess we can't go under it either.
0,43,40,CARTER,This isn't like any Goa'uld shield we've ever come across. It's more like a solid wall. The power output for something like this must be enormous.
0,43,40,MAKEPEACE,"That's fascinating Captain, but now what'll we do?"
0,43,40,HAMMOND,How long are they overdue?
0,43,40,SERGEANT,"Five hours, Sir."
0,43,40,HAMMOND,"The plan called for SG3 to check in by now, if they lost contact. We'll open the gate and send a message through. The MALP's relay antenna might be able to get a signal to our teams."
0,43,40,SERGEANT,Stand by to engage.
0,43,41,TROFSKY,Kree! Chapp'ai!
0,43,41,SERGEANT,"Wormhole established, Sir."
0,43,42,HAMMOND,
0,43,42,MAKEPEACE,"Hold up, hold up."
0,43,42,HAMMOND,This is HAMMOND. Over.
0,43,42,CARTER,The energy barrier must be amplifying the signal.
0,43,42,MAKEPEACE,"General, this is Three Niner. We hear you Sir."
0,43,42,HAMMOND,What's your status?
0,43,42,MAKEPEACE,"We have two surviving Sierra Gulf Team One members, Sir, but we have been cut off from the STARGATE. We found cover in tunnels we presume were made by the Tok'ra, but we cannot reach the STARGATE without reinforcements."
0,43,42,HAMMOND,"See if you can direct the MALP's camera to get a picture of the STARGATE itself. That'll take some time, Colonel. We'll try to send reinforcements through the STARGATE in exactly six hours from now. Coordinate your offensive accordingly."
0,43,42,MAKEPEACE,"Roger that, Sir."
0,43,44,HAMMOND,"Colonel MAKEPEACE, come in. Colonel"
0,43,45,HAMMOND,One armored platoon should be able to take the STARGATE.
0,43,45,DAVIS,"General, Sir, I'm sorry, it's not up to me. And even if it was, I don 't agree with it."
0,43,45,HAMMOND,I don't really give a damn if you agree with me Major.
0,43,45,DAVIS,"With all due respect, Sir, you took a shot based on intelligence you believed to be trustworthy, but obviously."
0,43,45,HAMMOND,I promised reinforcements.
0,43,45,DAVIS,"The President and Joint Chiefs are simply unwilling to risk further loss of life, Sir. Those are their orders. I'm sorry. I'm afraid, if your people are going to make it back, they're gonna have to do it on their own."
0,43,45,HAMMOND,"I see. Thank you, Major."
0,43,45,DAVIS,"Thank you, Sir."
0,43,45,CARTER,"Sir, I've been thinking. The energy barrier extends for miles around the facility. So it must be powered from the inside, some sort of field generator. Now the Tok'ra used these tunnels to access the facility."
0,43,45,MAKEPEACE,They must lead to it somehow.
0,43,45,CARTER,Right. Request permission to go back and try to shut it down.
0,43,45,DANIEL,I'll go with you.
0,43,45,CARTER,"No Daniel, you're hurt."
0,43,45,MAKEPEACE,I'll send an SG team along to back you up.
0,43,45,CARTER,"Even if I can knock out the generator, you're gonna need everyone you've got to take on those towers."
0,43,45,MAKEPEACE,"Alright. If you can, blow the generator just before our reinforcements come through. We'll try to take on the towers at the same time. That might give us the tactical advantage we need."
0,43,45,CARTER,Good luck.
0,43,45,MAKEPEACE,"We'll try to hold the door open. Alright people, let's go. Move it!"
0,43,47,BRA'TAC,
0,43,48,TEAL'C,The Goa'uld are not gods.
0,43,48,PRIESTESS,Shova!
0,43,48,TEAL'C,"It is a lie we live each day. Only when he takes a host does a Goa' uld become strong. Even then, only as strong as the Jaffa who serve him. Without us, the Goa'uld are nothing."
0,43,48,PRIESTESS,Lies!
0,43,48,TEAL'C,"We are their strength, we are their power.until we choose to serve them no more. I was witness to the final breath of APOPHIS. I watched him tremble with fear for what lay beyond. I believed that day would be honored for all time on Chulak. But instead, I see Jaffa taking up arms against one another. I see cowardice and I am ashamed. This is our time, it will not come again. But first we must grow stronger, as the people of the Tau'ri have done. I call for warriors to join me through the Chapp'ai, to gather weapons, to forge alliances with other Jaffa who seek freedom. To show the Goa'uld we will do battle with them wherever they may be. Who will join me?"
0,43,49,TEAL'C,General.
0,43,49,HAMMOND,"Not what I'd call an army, but it's a start."
0,43,49,BRA'TAC,
0,43,49,HAMMOND,"Master BRA'TAC. Gentlemen, I need your help."
0,43,50,RALEIGH,"Forgive me, there was no other way."
0,43,50,CARTER,You're the Tok'ra.
0,43,50,RALEIGH,"Those controls are set. Activate them. The Goa'uld within is gone. The cryogenic process destroyed it, before it had a chance to meld with the host. He will revive automatically."
0,43,50,CARTER,Colonel? I don't feel its presence. You're gonna be alright.
0,43,51,HATHOR,We had hopes for you. We will destroy you for this!
0,43,51,O'NEILL,We would just like you to go away! CARTER!
0,43,51,CARTER,What happened?
0,43,51,O'NEILL,HATHOR'S.gone.
0,43,51,CARTER,What about you?
0,43,51,O'NEILL,"Cold, a little chilly, but.I'm me. I'm me."
0,43,51,CARTER,Colonel MAKEPEACE came through with half a dozen SG teams to rescue us. But TROFSKY'S got us cut off from the STARGATE. He's using an energy barrier. It originates from somewhere in this facility. The plan is to blow it before General HAMMOND sends reinforcements.
0,43,51,O'NEILL,And how do we plan to do that?
0,43,52,RALEIGH,What you seek is hidden within the mock-up of your STARGATE facility.
0,43,52,CARTER,What about you?
0,43,52,RALEIGH,My symbiote may yet heal me. You must hurry. Go.
0,43,53,HAMMOND,What exactly are we looking for? We don't have much time.
0,43,53,TEAL'C,"As you said, the gate is carefully guarded."
0,43,53,BRA'TAC,"The STARGATE is most defensible. To be assured of victory, we will require an advantage, one hidden away, forgotten when I was still First Prime of APOPHIS."
0,43,53,HAMMOND,Why?
0,43,53,BRA'TAC,Few pilots could master it.
0,43,53,HAMMOND,And how long ago was it?
0,43,53,BRA'TAC,Some.hundred years. The forest has changed much in that time.
0,43,53,TEAL'C,"There is an old Jaffa saying, General HAMMOND - they do not build them as they once did."
0,43,53,BRA'TAC,Here!
0,43,53,HAMMOND,You intend to fly this thing?
0,43,53,BRA'TAC,Not I. Threading the needle is a skill for the young.
0,43,54,CARTER,"The energy barrier extends around the facility for miles. The generators must be massive. We're getting close. I'm getting energy readings off the scale. She was right, Sir, the generator's somewhere in here."
0,43,54,O'NEILL,What do you think?
0,43,54,CARTER,Try it.
0,43,57,O'NEILL,"This part of your plan, Captain?"
0,43,57,CARTER,"No, Sir."
0,43,57,TROFSKY,"I know that you are still out there, Captain CARTER! I grow tired of this. Surrender now, or your friends will be killed one by one."
0,43,57,DANIEL,"Don't listen to him, Sam!"
0,43,57,TROFSKY,Silence! I will give you one minute.
0,43,57,CARTER,The reinforcements should come through in a couple of minutes. We could detonate the C4.
0,43,57,O'NEILL,
0,43,57,CARTER,Right.
0,43,57,O'NEILL,Blow that C4 the minute the cavalry comes through that GATE.
0,43,57,CARTER,What if they don't?
0,43,57,O'NEILL,What if they don't???
0,43,57,CARTER,"They will, they will."
0,43,57,O'NEILL,"Jaffa, kree!"
0,43,57,TROFSKY,"Kel'mac, Goa'uld? Kree'tak?"
0,43,57,O'NEILL,"You heard me, I said Kree!"
0,43,57,DANIEL,Jack?
0,43,57,O'NEILL,"Hey guys. MAKEPEACE, nice rescue. Good job."
0,43,57,TROFSKY,Silence!
0,43,57,O'NEILL,"Alright, listen up. There's something you should know before you start shooting and killing and ruining what could be the start of a beautiful friendship - our beloved HATHOR.is dead."
0,43,57,TROFSKY,"What you say is impossible. HATHOR is a queen. More than that, she is a goddess."
0,43,57,O'NEILL,"Yeah ok, ex goddess, maybe. I killed her myself. You should trust me on this, she's gone. She is no more. She's.well, let's face it, she's a former queen. So why don't we just put an end to this right now?"
0,43,57,TROFSKY,We will end this with your surrender!
0,43,58,TROFSKY,"Jaffa kree, Chapp'ai!"
0,43,59,TEAL'C,"Firing the weapon will be your responsibility, General HAMMOND."
0,43,59,HAMMOND,Understood.
0,43,59,O'NEILL,Now.
0,43,60,HAMMOND,What exactly did he mean by threading the needle?
0,43,60,TEAL'C,Observe.
0,43,60,O'NEILL,Get down!
0,43,61,CARTER,Colonel!
0,43,62,TEAL'C,Fire.
0,43,62,HAMMOND,Yeeeehaaaw!
0,43,63,BRA'TAC,"Jaffa, kelmek! Kelmek! Human."
