0,44,0,"""SETH""",By Jonathan Glassner
0,44,1,JACOB,George.
0,44,1,HAMMOND,Jacob.
0,44,1,JACOB,"Colonel O'Neill, Teal'c, Daniel. Sam."
0,44,2,JACOB,How are you doing kid?
0,44,2,CARTER,Okay Dad.
0,44,2,JACOB,"So, you guys are the talk of the Tok'ra water cooler."
0,44,2,O'NEILL,For what?
0,44,2,JACOB,Kicking some major Hathor behind.
0,44,2,O'NEILL,Yes we do take pride in good work. But that's not why you're here?
0,44,2,JACOB,No. We need your help.
0,44,2,CARTER,You need our help? With what?
0,44,2,JACOB,Let's just call it a Goa'uld hunt.
0,44,4,DANIEL,It's fascinating.
0,44,4,CARTER,"No kidding. A projected hologram with no silver halide coated plates, no photo polymer film."
0,44,4,DANIEL,"Actually, I was talking about what's being projected. It's like a family tree of the ancient Egyptian gods."
0,44,4,JACOB,"Actually, of the Goa'uld System Lords."
0,44,4,DANIEL,"Ra, Apophis, Hathor, Heru'Ur."
0,44,4,TEAL'C,The symbol of Setesh is oscillating.
0,44,4,DANIEL,That is the symbol for Setesh.
0,44,4,JACOB,Have you met him Teal'c?
0,44,4,TEAL'C,I have met descendants of his Jaffa.
0,44,4,O'NEILL,All right. Who's this Setesh fella?
0,44,4,DANIEL,"Otherwise known as Setekh, Set, Seti, Seth. Ancient Egyptian god of chaos. The embodiment of hostility and outright evil."
0,44,4,HAMMOND,Why haven't we heard of him before?
0,44,4,DANIEL,"Well I'm guessing we haven't even scratched the surface on meeting all the Goa'uld System Lords. There's probably thousands we haven't even heard of, right?"
0,44,4,JACOB,Only dozens at the ranks of System Lords. Thousands of Goa'ulds in general.
0,44,4,CARTER,What makes you think we would have met this one?
0,44,4,JACOB,"The Tok'ra council has been taking a Goa'uld census of sorts. Where the System Lords are positioning themselves, what domain they rule, who serves under them, that sort of thing. But there's one Goa'uld we've lost track of."
0,44,4,O'NEILL,Seth?
0,44,4,JACOB,Our record of him ends when the Earth's Gate was buried in ancient Egypt.
0,44,4,CARTER,Are you saying he never left?
0,44,4,JACOB,"That's our theory. We think he still might be here, hiding among Earth's people."
0,44,4,O'NEILL,"All right, we'll be cuttin' to the chase on this one. You want us to help you find this snakehead who, if he's here at all, would be hiding in one of 6 billion people on Earth?"
0,44,4,JACOB,Yes.
0,44,4,CARTER,How do you know he's still alive?
0,44,4,DANIEL,He's alive if he has a sarcophagus.
0,44,4,JACOB,Or if he changes hosts every 400 years or so.
0,44,4,HAMMOND,"But if he were here, why wouldn't he have tried to get at the Stargate some time between when it was buried and now? Or why wouldn't he try to take over the Earth like Ra did?"
0,44,4,JACOB,"Seth had a hefty price on his head-he tried to overthrow Ra. Now the System Lords wanted him dead, as did the Tok'ra. We believe if he's still here it's because he's using Earth as a place to hideout. He wishes to remain hidden among you."
0,44,4,O'NEILL,"Kinda gives ""needle in a haystack"" a whole new meaning."
0,44,4,JACOB,Well I know it's a long shot.
0,44,4,DANIEL,Not necessarily. Remember Setesh is a Goa'uld.
0,44,4,O'NEILL,Yeah?
0,44,4,TEAL'C,As a Goa'uld he will never lose his thirst for power.
0,44,4,DANIEL,And they do have a pretty common MO for getting that power.
0,44,4,TEAL'C,False religion.
0,44,4,DANIEL,"Which shrinks the proverbial haystack considerably. Let me do some homework, track him through archaeological and historical record."
0,44,4,HAMMOND,Do it.
0,44,6,CARTER,"So Dad, you don't really think we have a chance of finding this Goa' uld, do you?"
0,44,6,JACOB,It's the mission Garshaw assigned me.
0,44,6,CARTER,You didn't request it? Dad?
0,44,6,JACOB,Why would I request it?
0,44,6,CARTER,C'mon! Would it be so awful to admit you just wanted a chance to see me?
0,44,6,JACOB,Of course not- you're right. That's why I requested it.
0,44,6,CARTER,"Okay, so that's obviously not the reason. What's going on?"
0,44,6,SELMAK,It is I who requested the assignment.
0,44,6,CARTER,Selmak!
0,44,6,SELMAK,Nice to see you once again Captain Carter.
0,44,6,CARTER,Likewise. So let me ask you the same question.
0,44,6,SELMAK,"Your father has an unresolved issue here on your planet, and frankly it's beginning to irritate me."
0,44,6,CARTER,Mark.
0,44,6,SELMAK,Your father's a proud man. He refuses to seek out your brother and mend the relationship.
0,44,6,CARTER,"Yeah, well Mark isn't exactly rushing into my father's arms either. Even when we thought Dad was gonna die, he wouldn't take my call."
0,44,6,SELMAK,It hurt your father deeply when his son didn't come to him on his deathbed.
0,44,6,JACOB,Now why would it hurt? As far as I was concerned the kid wasn't my son any more. It didn't hurt a bit.
0,44,6,CARTER,Dad. I have a number for Mark in San Diego.
0,44,6,JACOB,So?
0,44,6,CARTER,I just thought you might wanna know.
0,44,6,JACOB,When was the last time you saw him?
0,44,6,CARTER,I haven't seen him since either of his kids were born. I guess he paints me with the same brush he does you.
0,44,6,JACOB,"Well, Selmak's pushing me to go mend some fences."
0,44,6,CARTER,I guess Selmak is as wise as they say. I'll go with you. When do you wanna do it?
0,44,6,JACOB,I didn't say I'd go. I just said Selmak's pushing it.
0,44,7,JACOB,So what's the bad news?
0,44,7,TEAL'C,On the contrary. We have good news.
0,44,7,CARTER,You do?
0,44,7,DANIEL,"I did a time line Boolean search for religion, cult, Set, Setesh, Setekh, Seth.."
0,44,7,O'NEILL,Yadda.
0,44,7,DANIEL,And here's what I found. It appears there's been a cult of Setesh throughout history in one form or another since around 1000 BC.
0,44,7,CARTER,What is that?
0,44,7,DANIEL,"Oh yeah, that. Well Setesh was represented by an animal that was either fictitious or now extinct. Most likely the former, rather than the latter since anthropologists haven't discovered any fossils to point to a species like this ever existing."
0,44,7,TEAL'C,"Because the creature represents Setesh, the helmets of the Setesh guard have continued to be the source of many jokes among the jaffa."
0,44,7,O'NEILL,Jaffa jokes? Let's hear one of them.
0,44,7,TEAL'C,"I shall attempt to translate one O'Neill. A serpent guard, a Horus guard and a Setesh guard meet on a neutral planet. It is a tense moment. The serpent guard's eyes glow. The Horus guard's beak glistens. The Setesh guard 's nose drips."
0,44,8,DANIEL,"Okay. After Set was supposedly killed in ancient Egypt along with all his minions, a similar god showed up in Greece called Typhon. Similar back-stories and domains. Another fictitious animal representation. In one of Typhon's last legends he killed three hundred followers and then disappeared from Greece. Now at that point he seemed to have vanished from recorded history until I found this. A new cult arose in England in the early 1800's, strangely enough near the location of Stonehenge. The cult had an enigmatic leader called Seth. They were constantly under attack by the Christians and this is the important part. Seth's worshippers, all of them, were found dead, having slit their own throats. But Seth's body was never found."
0,44,8,O'NEILL,Guy liked to leave a lot of dead bodies behind.
0,44,8,CARTER,Did you lose the scent there?
0,44,8,DANIEL,"I thought so, until on a whim, I did a search on the US Government's classified net in case the CIA had a record of something, somewhere. And guess what came up on the ATF page. A cult whose leader is named Seth. Just north of Seattle. The ATF are investigating him now because they've become so heavily armed and fortified. This guy has about 50 followers who are all apparently ready to die for him."
0,44,8,JACOB,You mean to say you actually found this guy?
0,44,8,CARTER,How do we know he's our Goa'uld?
0,44,8,DANIEL,"Deprogrammed ex members of the cult describe Seth as having magical powers and the ability to heal. They also claim he's murdered several members in front of the others. Here's the best part. ""Several independent reports have stated that the cult leader can make his own eyes glow."
0,44,9,SHERIFF,"That's the place. Main building's about three-quarters of a mile up that drive. I sure hope you can shut these guys down. I had a lot of parents come into my office- they lost their kids to this nut. I haven't got the manpower, or the, uh what you'd call probable cause that you federal types do."
0,44,9,O'NEILL,"Well, we'll do what we can Sheriff. Appreciate you lettin' us look around."
0,44,9,RADIO,Sheriff. We got a fight breaking out down at Earl's.
0,44,9,SHERIFF,"Duty calls. Now, uh looks like you don't need me getting' in your way. Gimme a call if you need me."
0,44,9,O'NEILL,Will do.
0,44,10,JASON,You people the FBI?
0,44,10,O'NEILL,No. Who are you?
0,44,10,JASON,"The name's Jason Levinson. I've been camping down here for the past month hoping to catch a glimpse of my boy, Tommy. At least know he's still alive. He's been in there nine months now. You folks deprogrammers? You gotta be good. The guy I hired got shot in the leg trying to get in there."
0,44,10,O'NEILL,So they've got some armed guards is what you're saying?
0,44,10,JASON,A lot of them. What's that damn small town sheriff do about it? Nothing. Not a damn thing. You're the father aren't you? Your boy 's in there.
0,44,10,JACOB,"No, no. You've got that wrong. My son isn't in there."
0,44,10,JASON,Uh huh. How much would you tack on to get my boy out the same time as his?
0,44,10,O'NEILL,You help us. We might be able to help you.
0,44,10,JASON,I'm with you sir.
0,44,10,O'NEILL,"That won't be necessary, but we could use any information you might have. What your guy did, where he went in, where he got caught, that kind of stuff."
0,44,10,JASON,You got it. The fence is in the wide open and most of the property. But I'll show you a brush cover if you wanna go in.
0,44,10,TEAL'C,O'Neill. We are being surveilled.
0,44,10,O'NEILL,"Yeah, I saw 'em. It's probably FBI. Maybe ATF."
0,44,11,JASON,You guys are prepared. I'm goin' with you.
0,44,11,DANIEL,I think it'd be safer for everyone if you wait for us here.
0,44,12,O'NEILL,
0,44,12,CARTER,"Sir, they're side arms. I think it's safe to say there's a Goa'uld there. And, it looks like a pair of 50 cals."
0,44,12,O'NEILL,Does the concept of overkill mean anything to anybody? Let's fall back to the RV point.
0,44,13,HAMNER,Lower your weapons!
0,44,13,O'NEILL,"I was wondering when you folks were gonna show. We got bets- I say FBI, they say ATF."
0,44,13,HAMNER,"Special Agent James Hamner, ATF."
0,44,13,O'NEILL,Damn!
0,44,14,HAMNER,General. Wanna tell me what interest the Air Force has here?
0,44,14,O'NEILL,That would be classified.
0,44,14,HAMNER,"This way, gentlemen. Are you guys special forces?"
0,44,14,O'NEILL,Also classified.
0,44,14,HAMNER,I was talking to your commanding officer.
0,44,14,JACOB,He's right. It's classified.
0,44,14,HAMNER,I have top level clearance.
0,44,14,O'NEILL,"Oh, not top enough."
0,44,14,HAMNER,"You have a rather insubordinate subordinate, General."
0,44,14,JACOB,He's not insubordinate to me. Only to people such as yourself. Saves me the trouble. Now maybe you could tell us what you and your cohorts are planning here.
0,44,14,HAMNER,This compound is owned by a cult. It's run by a charming guy who goes by the name Seth Fargough. We've recently acquired intelligence to confirm they have a hoard of prohibited weaponry here.
0,44,14,O'NEILL,That's a mighty fine intelligence you got there.
0,44,14,JACOB,So what do you plan to do?
0,44,14,HAMNER,"Surround the compound and negotiate, try to get 'em to come out peacefully."
0,44,14,DANIEL,You have no idea what you're dealing with.
0,44,14,HAMNER,And I suppose you do?
0,44,14,DANIEL,As a matter of fact.
0,44,14,HAMNER,Great! Then why don't you tell me?
0,44,14,O'NEILL,"Uh, that would be classified as well."
0,44,14,HAMNER,"Fine! Well I'll tell you what. The United States Air Force has not been invited to participate in this operation therefore you're out of your jurisdiction. Therefore I'm ordering you all to leave, or I'll have you arrested."
0,44,14,JACOB,"This is a secure phone, isn't it? Can we use it to place one call?"
0,44,14,HAMNER,Why not?
0,44,14,JACOB,Thank you. Colonel?
0,44,15,DANIEL,"Jack, based on Seth's history if these guys go in guns blazing, he's gonna kill everyone in there."
0,44,15,O'NEILL,"Jacob, can we assume some kind of brainwashing is going on in there?"
0,44,15,JACOB,"It's probably Nish'ta. It's a biological compound that inhaled infects all tissue in you body, including your brain. It tends to make your mind extremely pliable."
0,44,15,DANIEL,That's like what Hathor used.
0,44,15,JACOB,It's stronger. It's more encompassing.
0,44,15,TEAL'C,I believe that is the substance used on Rya'c.
0,44,15,O'NEILL,Can it be reversed?
0,44,15,JACOB,"Nish'ta does have an Achilles heel. Once its effects are reversed, it can't reinfect a host. They become immune."
0,44,15,DANIEL,"Okay, well, how do we reverse it?"
0,44,15,JACOB,"There's only one way: an electrical shock. Strong enough to kill the organism, but weak enough not to kill the host."
0,44,15,TEAL'C,That is why it worked when I shot Rya'c with a zat'n'ktel.
0,44,15,O'NEILL,Then we go in with zats.
0,44,15,DANIEL,"Well it's not going to be very covert that way. And, like I said, any kind of frontal attack is gonna be a problem."
0,44,15,CARTER,"Daniel's right Sir. Besides, with all the firepower he's got, we wouldn't stand much of a chance anyway."
0,44,17,HAMNER,"Hamner. Yes, Mr President. Yes Sir, I am the SRO. Yes Sir, they are here, sir, but. With respect Sir, the jurisdictional rules in this case are clear. This is a civilian matter. Are you sure you wanna do that Sir? Yes Mr President."
0,44,18,O'NEILL,Something I can do for you?
0,44,18,HAMNER,You wanna tell me what's going on?
0,44,18,O'NEILL,Didn't you say you know more than I do?
0,44,18,HAMNER,Well apparently not. I just got off the phone with the President.
0,44,18,O'NEILL,Of the United States of America? Sweet. How's he doin'?
0,44,18,HAMNER,He seems to have a thing for you.
0,44,18,O'NEILL,"Yeah well, you know."
0,44,18,HAMNER,"In fact, I'm to issue you an emergency special agent credential. He' s put you in charge of this operation."
0,44,18,O'NEILL,Excellent! My first order of business: Get me one of those cool jackets! Extra large. Double X-L if you got it.
0,44,18,HAMNER,You wanna tell me why the Air Force cares so much about this cult?
0,44,18,O'NEILL,"Wanna do me a favour? On your way out, send my team in."
0,44,18,HAMNER,Your team. It's an odd bunch of people Colonel. Civilian scientists. This Seth guy got some kind of secret weapon you don't want the world to know about?
0,44,18,O'NEILL,"All right, listen. Since you have clearance, I'll throw you a bone. Seth and his boys got their hands on some top-secret technology, that we would prefer not fall into the public consciousness just yet. Comprehend?"
0,44,18,HAMNER,Yeah.
0,44,18,O'NEILL,Good. Now you've heard of classified.
0,44,18,HAMNER,You got it.
0,44,18,O'NEILL,Thank you.
0,44,19,CARTER,Did General Hammond get the President involved Sir?
0,44,19,O'NEILL,Oh yeah! He's put me in charge here for the time being.
0,44,19,TEAL'C,What do you suggest O'Neill?
0,44,19,O'NEILL,"Well, I'm thinkin' we need to get in there."
0,44,19,CARTER,"Okay, how?"
0,44,19,O'NEILL,Floor's open.
0,44,19,DANIEL,"Well I was thinking about that. If Seth's MO hasn't changed from his history, we know certain things from digs in Giza and the Valley of the Kings."
0,44,19,CARTER,We do?
0,44,19,DANIEL,"For example, many Egyptian leaders built their compounds with underground escape tunnels."
0,44,19,TEAL'C,That is correct. Apophis had them built into his facilities.
0,44,19,CARTER,"Okay, so we should do a perimeter search outside the fence and look for those tunnel entrances."
0,44,19,O'NEILL,That's a lot of territory. We'll have Mr Hamner's men help us.
0,44,20,TEAL'C,O'Neill!
0,44,20,CARTER,"Okay, we've got a point of entry now what? As soon as we get near anyone on the inside we could get compromised and shot."
0,44,20,DANIEL,"Or worse, we get dosed with that organism and all of a sudden we're working for Seth."
0,44,20,JACOB,It won't work on me or Teal'c.
0,44,20,CARTER,"Yeah, but he'll sense your Goa'ulds as soon as you're within 50 feet. With the arsenal he's got we wouldn't even get close to him without being gunned down."
0,44,20,O'NEILL,Which is why you're not going in.
0,44,20,CARTER,"Dad, you said an electrical shock, like a zat gun, would snap us out of it?"
0,44,20,JACOB,Yeah?
0,44,20,CARTER,"Sir, I think I have an idea."
0,44,21,HAMNER,Gimme a test count.
0,44,21,DANIEL,"One Mississippi, Two Mississippi, Three Mississippi, Four Mississippi, Five Mississippi."
0,44,21,O'NEILL,Carter?
0,44,21,CARTER,"It'll work Sir, assuming Dad's right."
0,44,21,O'NEILL,Dad?
0,44,21,JACOB,If the jolt is big enough it'll work. But you have to stay under the Nish'ta's control long enough for it to spread through all your tissues otherwise it will regain a stronghold in your bold.
0,44,21,HAMNER,Gimme a ten count.
0,44,21,O'NEILL,"Uh, one, two, three, four, five."
0,44,21,HAMNER,That's good. You ready for yours Captain?
0,44,21,CARTER,"One second. Okay, Teal'c push the button."
0,44,22,DANIEL,Aargh!
0,44,22,O'NEILL,Hey! Okay?
0,44,22,CARTER,Okay. Wire me.
0,44,24,CARTER,"So Daniel, you feel pretty certain that if we get caught, he'll turn us into one of those zombies rather than kill us?"
0,44,24,DANIEL,Well we're more valuable to him that way.
0,44,24,CARTER,Why? How do you think he'll use us?
0,44,24,DANIEL,"Well, historically he used women as a harem. They catered to his every whim and as a result they were well cared for."
0,44,24,CARTER,Super.
0,44,24,DANIEL,"And the men outside the main court were used mostly as warriors and guards protecting his compound, pretty much doing his bidding."
0,44,24,O'NEILL,Dare I ask about the men inside the compound?
0,44,24,DANIEL,They were turned into eunuchs.
0,44,24,O'NEILL,"Eunuchs as in ""snippety-doo-dah""? Sweet."
0,44,25,O'NEILL,Daniel?
0,44,25,DANIEL,What?
0,44,25,O'NEILL,Now what?
0,44,25,DANIEL,Why are you asking me?
0,44,25,CARTER,"Well, y.. you knew there'd be tunnels, so."
0,44,25,DANIEL,"Well, in the digs there were stairs leading up to the main structure."
0,44,26,O'NEILL,I hate it when that happens.
0,44,27,SETH,Welcome! Who are you?
0,44,27,O'NEILL,"Well, I'm Larry, this is Moe and, of course, everyone's favourite, Curly."
0,44,27,SETH,Say goodbye to your impure military past. We're always happy to welcome new disciples to the bliss that only Seth can bestow.
0,44,28,O'NEILL,"So help me, if I wake up and I'm singing soprano."
0,44,30,WOMAN,"Welcome, disciple. How are you feeling?"
0,44,30,CARTER,Okay. Pretty good.
0,44,30,WOMAN,Good. Do you feel strong enough to begin service of your god Seth?
0,44,30,CARTER,"Yes, of course."
0,44,30,WOMAN,This way.
0,44,32,TEAL'C,They are awake. Shall I activate the devices?
0,44,32,SELMAK,No. We must wait to be sure that the Nish'ta has permeated their tissues before negating it.
0,44,32,TEAL'C,How long?
0,44,32,SELMAK,About an hour. It's a smart virus. If there's any unaffected tissue remaining in the body it will give the organism a safe harbour in which to mutate. Then it will overtake your body once again.
0,44,32,JASON,Excuse me. Mind if I watch? I mean my son's in there. I just wanna be involved.
0,44,32,JACOB,I'm afraid I can't let you in here sir. I'm sorry.
0,44,32,JASON,"Yeah, figured. Grab a cup of coffee?"
0,44,32,JACOB,"Sure, go ahead."
0,44,33,JASON,Ow!
0,44,34,JASON,Sorry. Sorry. It won't happen again. I've just been kinda short fused since I found out about Tommy.
0,44,34,TEAL'C,I understand.
0,44,34,JASON,"I had to find out from his college roommate cos, uh, Tommy and me hadn't been talking for something like six months before they sucked him in."
0,44,34,TEAL'C,I do not understand. How could a father not speak to his son for so long a time?
0,44,34,JASON,"Yeah, that's the funny thing about it: I don't even remember why. Obviously something pretty stupid in the scheme of things. I'll get out of your hair."
0,44,34,TEAL'C,Do human parents not love their children unconditionally?
0,44,34,JACOB,Sometimes things get complicated.
0,44,34,TEAL'C,"Many things are complicated, General Carter. In Jaffa society, loving one's children is not one of them."
0,44,34,JACOB,"In human society, sometimes it is."
0,44,37,SETH,With these weapons I have provided we will defend against any incursion by the impure forces outside our gate. Let no other gods draw you away from Seth.
0,44,37,ALL,Seth is life. Seth is happiness. Seth is almighty.
0,44,37,SETH,Again!
0,44,37,ALL,Seth is life. Seth is happiness. Seth is almighty.
0,44,38,ALL,Seth is life. Seth is happiness. Seth is almighty.
0,44,39,SETH,You were once blended. Were you not?!
0,44,39,CARTER,Blended?
0,44,39,SETH,No entry marks. But still..I sense a trace. Bring me those who came with her!
0,44,40,TEAL'C,"General Carter, there is a problem."
0,44,40,HAMNER,What?
0,44,40,JACOB,It's nothing we can't handle.
0,44,40,HAMNER,He made your people didn't he?
0,44,40,JACOB,We don't know yet.
0,44,41,SETH,Who sent you? The System Lords? The Tok'ra? I am your god! You will tell me what I want to know! Who does your military work for? The System Lords or the Tok'ra?
0,44,41,CARTER,I have a vague recollection of what you're talking about. The Tok' ra.
0,44,42,TEAL'C,Is it not time enough?
0,44,42,SELMAK,No choice. Do it now!
0,44,44,O'NEILL,We work for a deprogrammer who hired us to come remove one of your disciples.
0,44,44,DANIEL,But now we are enjoying the bliss that is Seth.
0,44,44,SETH,How is it possible that you enjoy the bliss when you are able to lie to Seth?
0,44,44,TOMMY,"My Lord, the impure forces that you have prophesied are surrounding the compound."
0,44,44,SETH,You will pay eternally for bringing this down upon us. Take them and kill them.
0,44,44,TOMMY,Go!
0,44,45,O'NEILL,A quick question about old Seth.
0,44,46,TOMMY,What happened?
0,44,46,CARTER,"It's okay, we're here to help you."
0,44,49,SETH,We must distribute them all over the compound. We cannot allow the impure access to all we have built up here.
0,44,50,DANIEL,"Um, Daniel."
0,44,50,TOMMY,Tom.
0,44,50,O'NEILL,Levinson?
0,44,50,TOMMY,"Yeah. Uh, I'm really confused. Who are you?"
0,44,50,DANIEL,We're friends of your father.
0,44,50,O'NEILL,Where are the zats?
0,44,50,TOMMY,Zats?
0,44,50,CARTER,These.
0,44,51,CARTER,"Now, can you activate those transport rings?"
0,44,51,TOMMY,I think so.
0,44,51,O'NEILL,"Tom, I need you to start transporting people outta here. Can you handle that?"
0,44,51,TOMMY,
0,44,51,O'NEILL,Good.
0,44,52,HAMNER,"I have to prepare for the worst. If your people have been compromised and I don't act, it's on me if they get killed."
0,44,52,JACOB,"It won't be on you, it'll be on me."
0,44,52,TEAL'C,It will reside on me also.
0,44,54,O'NEILL,Go!
0,44,55,O'NEILL,Carter! Go with 'em. Make sure they get outta here.
0,44,57,HAMNER,"Okay, I think I've been very patient."
0,44,58,HAMNER,"Let's get all the medical teams up here stat! Get some blankets and shoes! Come on you guys, get in here!"
0,44,60,CARTER,"Okay! C'mon, let's go! This way! C'mon!"
0,44,62,SETH,How dare you challenge the power that is Seth?
0,44,63,DANIEL,Bomb?
0,44,63,O'NEILL,Bomb.
0,44,64,JASON,Tommy? Tommy.
0,44,65,TEAL'C,General Carter! Our friends have been neutralised. I must go in. I believe Selmak would be of help.
0,44,65,HAMNER,Who's Selmak?
0,44,65,JACOB,It's a long story.
0,44,66,O'NEILL,This way!
0,44,66,JACOB,Teal'c! Stay outside and cover the other ends. Make sure he doesn't get out another way.
0,44,66,CARTER,Dad? Where are you going?
0,44,66,JACOB,Setesh used a hand device on Colonel O'Neill and Daniel. Are you okay?
0,44,66,CARTER,I'm fine.
0,44,66,O'NEILL,Carter! He's down here!
0,44,67,SELMAK,Setesh!
0,44,67,SETH,Tok'ra kree chok!
0,44,68,CARTER,Dad!
0,44,68,SELMAK,Your father will survive. Stop Seth.
0,44,68,CARTER,How? I can't control this.
0,44,68,SELMAK,You have the will within you. You must summon it.
0,44,69,CARTER,Hey!
0,44,70,DANIEL,You killed him.
0,44,70,O'NEILL,Hail Dorothy
