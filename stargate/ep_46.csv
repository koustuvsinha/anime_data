0,46,0,"""LEGACY""",By Tor Alexander Valenza
0,46,0,A DARKENED CORRIDOR,
0,46,0,O'NEILL,Daniel? Any ideas about this place?
0,46,0,DANIEL,"Well it looks like it was built by a pretty advanced culture, then stripped and deserted."
0,46,0,CARTER,The MALP showed no life signs.
0,46,0,O'NEILL,Teal'c? What do you think?
0,46,0,TEAL'C,It is an ancient Goa'uld design.
0,46,1,O'NEILL,Now that is not a good smell.
0,46,2,DANIEL,Jesus!
0,46,3,O'NEILL,All right. Level A.
0,46,3,TEAL'C,There is another one here.
0,46,3,O'NEILL,More over there.
0,46,4,CARTER,These aren't quite human. They're Goa'uld.
0,46,4,TEAL'C,This mechanism appears to have been damaged by a ribbon device.
0,46,4,CARTER,Maybe they were trying to contain whatever did this.
0,46,4,DANIEL,"Teal'c, do you recognise this symbol?"
0,46,4,TEAL'C,It is the crest of the Linvris.
0,46,4,O'NEILL,Which is what? Or who/
0,46,4,TEAL'C,A rival league of lesser Goa'uld who challenge the System Lords.
0,46,4,O'NEILL,A minor league?
0,46,4,TEAL'C,Yes. There are nine.
0,46,4,CARTER,"Five, six, seven, eight, nine. Found 'em."
0,46,5,DANIEL,"It's one of those Goa'uld tablet devices, the kind we found on Argos."
0,46,5,CARTER,Can you translate it?
0,46,5,DANIEL,Part of it. It's some sort of battle plan. I need the hand device that makes the screen go to the next page.
0,46,5,O'NEILL,That thing?
0,46,6,DANIEL,Nothing's happening.
0,46,7,O'NEILL,What?
0,46,7,DANIEL,I felt something brush by me.
0,46,7,O'NEILL,"All right, let's pack it outta here. Leave this to the medical containment unit. It's getting creepy."
0,46,10,WOMAN,Dr. Jackson?
0,46,10,DANIEL,Out in minute!
0,46,10,WOMAN,Dr. Jackson!
0,46,13,CARTER,Daniel.
0,46,14,DANIEL,Were you calling me just now?
0,46,14,CARTER,No.
0,46,14,DANIEL,You weren't calling my name in the locker room a minute ago?
0,46,14,CARTER,"No, it wasn't me. General Hammond's waiting for us in the briefing room."
0,46,15,FRAISER,The Goa'uld died before their hosts. We know this due to a unique protein marker left in Goa'uld bodies or host bodies after a Goa'uld dies.
0,46,15,CARTER,The same protein marker that was left in my body after Jolinar was killed?
0,46,15,FRAISER,Yes.
0,46,15,HAMMOND,"How did they die, Doctor?"
0,46,15,FRAISER,"Well at this point Sir, I can't really give you an accurate answer and I may never be able to."
0,46,15,HAMMOND,Why not?
0,46,15,FRAISER,"As with Major Carter, as these Goa'uld symbiotes died they rapidly decayed and were absorbed by the host. There's no Goa'uld corpse for me to study."
0,46,15,O'NEILL,"What about bio warfare? Poison, disease, that kind of thing?"
0,46,15,TEAL'C,The Goa'uld are immune to such things.
0,46,15,DANIEL,What about the hosts?
0,46,15,FRAISER,"The humans were normal. No wounds, no infections."
0,46,15,DANIEL,"Okay then, why are they dead?"
0,46,15,FRAISER,"According to Teal'c, the door was disabled from the inside. Locked in with no food, no water, the probably died of starvation."
0,46,15,HAMMOND,"Right now, I'm more concerned with who killed the Goa'uld and why."
0,46,15,TEAL'C,The System Lords would be the most likely suspect.
0,46,15,O'NEILL,"But if the door was disabled from the inside, how did the perp, or perps, get out?"
0,46,15,CARTER,Maybe the assassins weren't visible and we're the ones who let them out.
0,46,15,O'NEILL,Reetou. You think Reetou were in there?
0,46,15,TEAL'C,Reetou would not spare the host. Reetou weaponry does much damage to the human body.
0,46,15,O'NEILL,Well there you go.
0,46,15,HAMMOND,"Dr. Jackson, what about that Goa'uld tablet device?"
0,46,16,PA,Incoming traveller.
0,46,16,DANIEL,"Um.. It's a Goa'uld dialect akin to Latin. From what Teal'c and I have made out so far, it's some sort of attack plan. Um.. I'm still trying to figure out how to scroll to the next page, if there is a next page."
0,46,16,HAMMOND,"Dr. Jackson, I want you to make translating that tablet your top priority."
0,46,16,DANIEL,Yes Sir.
0,46,16,HAMMOND,Dismissed.
0,46,17,PA,
0,46,20,DANIEL,To enter by infiltration. Infiltration.
0,46,20,MAN,Daniel.
0,46,21,MAN,Daniel! Daniel!
0,46,22,MAN,"Join with us, Daniel. Step through the Gate, Daniel."
0,46,22,DANIEL,This isn't real.
0,46,23,DANIEL,Help! Somebody help!
0,46,26,O'NEILL,Hello.
0,46,26,DANIEL,Hello.
0,46,26,O'NEILL,What happened?
0,46,26,DANIEL,Do you believe in ghosts?
0,46,26,O'NEILL,Uhh.. No. Uh huh.
0,46,26,DANIEL,Neither do I. Which means there has to be a logical explanation.
0,46,26,O'NEILL,For what?
0,46,26,DANIEL,"When we were in the Linvris chamber, I felt something brush by me. And I've heard voices. And I keep seeing the dead Goa'uld from the massacre."
0,46,26,O'NEILL,Where?
0,46,26,DANIEL,"Well, last night they were in my closet. In like a.. Stargate event horizon without the Gate."
0,46,26,O'NEILL,In your closet?
0,46,26,DANIEL,Yes. I don't think they're really dead.
0,46,26,O'NEILL,Who? The stiffs in the morgue?
0,46,26,DANIEL,"No, the nine Goa'uld that were using them as hosts. I translated a phrase in the tablet that I thought meant 'attack' but when I refined the translation, I realised it means 'to enter by infiltration'."
0,46,26,O'NEILL,And you think that's what they're doing?
0,46,26,DANIEL,Yes.
0,46,26,O'NEILL,Through your closet?
0,46,26,DANIEL,"Teal'c said the Linvris were being hunted by the System Lords, right? No what if they used some sort of technology that transformed their bodies into. I don't know, energy or something."
0,46,26,O'NEILL,Energy?
0,46,26,DANIEL,"Or something. I don't know exactly how- Sam can figure that part out. The point is, they're here. They've entered by infiltration and now they want me as a host."
0,46,26,O'NEILL,All nine of 'em?
0,46,26,DANIEL,"That sounds crazy, huh?"
0,46,26,O'NEILL,"Mmm.. Yeah. I. You gotta admit, there are some holes in you theory here."
0,46,26,DANIEL,"Well it's a theory, not a proof."
0,46,26,O'NEILL,Why are you the only one who can see them? Why didn't they come through my closet? Aside from the fact that yours is cleaner.
0,46,26,DANIEL,I don't know. The only other theory I can come up with is I'm having some sort of nervous breakdown.
0,46,26,O'NEILL,Or something. Yeah.
0,46,26,DANIEL,Or something.
0,46,28,O'NEILL,Doctor MacKenzie.
0,46,28,MACKENZIE,Colonel.
0,46,28,O'NEILL,I'm not going to enjoy this am I?
0,46,28,HAMMOND,Part of Dr. MacKenzie's work involves analysing psychological data from SG units specifically looking for side effects to Gate travel. Dr. Jackson's episode yesterday may have uncovered a serious one.
0,46,28,MACKENZIE,"Dr. Fraiser's been treating you for headaches lately, hasn't she?"
0,46,28,O'NEILL,Yes. What's that got to do with Daniel?
0,46,28,MACKENZIE,Well you're not the only one.53% of SG field personnel also have a history of them.
0,46,28,O'NEILL,A lot of people get headaches. What's your point?
0,46,28,MACKENZIE,"Dr. Jackson has experienced what I'd characterise as a first break psychotic episode, which may be manifesting full blown hebephrenic schizophrenia."
0,46,28,FRAISER,Migraines are often one of the first signs.
0,46,28,O'NEILL,Wait a minute. Daniel's a schizophrenic and it's caused by the Stargate?
0,46,28,FRAISER,"It's the only logical explanation we have right now, Colonel."
0,46,28,O'NEILL,Well it sounds fairly theoretical to me. Does anybody think it could be stress?
0,46,28,FRAISER,"As much as I'd like to think that's all it is, the evidence just doesn't point that way. Daniel has paranoid delusions, auditory and visual hallucinations."
0,46,28,MACKENZIE,Dr. Jackson's dopamine levels have increased in the left hemisphere of his brain. All these symptoms are textbook schizophrenia.
0,46,28,CARTER,I don't understand how this could happen without us noticing signs.
0,46,28,FRAISER,"Nobody knows the exact cause of schizophrenia. Some cases are genetic, but there's no history of it in Daniel's family. When it's not genetic, it's environmental and the Stargate is a plausible environmental cause."
0,46,28,CARTER,I've been through the Gate as many times as Daniel. I don't have headaches.
0,46,28,FRAISER,"Your body may have some kind of immunity, possibly due to Jolinar."
0,46,28,O'NEILL,"All right. Let's say for the sake of argument that it is the Stargate, a theory to which I do not ascribe. Then why don't we put a little sign at the base of the ramp that says ""Gate travel may be hazardous to your health""? I can live with that."
0,46,28,CARTER,So can I Sir.
0,46,28,HAMMOND,"The Air Force can't. I can't risk any SG officer having delusions in the middle of a crisis. Therefore, as we speak, all outstanding SG teams are being recalled for evaluation."
0,46,28,CARTER,You're shutting down the whole programme?
0,46,28,HAMMOND,Only until Dr. MacKenzie and his team submit their report. If his theory is proven correct limits will be placed on the number of missions. Till then the Stargate is closed.
0,46,28,O'NEILL,General.
0,46,28,HAMMOND,"There is no debate, Colonel."
0,46,28,O'NEILL,Of course not.
0,46,28,CARTER,"What about Daniel, Sir?"
0,46,28,MACKENZIE,"For now, we're going to medicate him and let him rest in one of the VIP rooms."
0,46,28,FRAISER,"But if his symptoms persist, or if he becomes a threat to himself or anyone else we'll have to commit him to Mental Health."
0,46,31,DANIEL,Check.
0,46,32,DANIEL,Oh.
0,46,32,O'NEILL,What? Didn't see that?
0,46,32,DANIEL,"Actually, I was oh-ing about something else."
0,46,33,DANIEL,Checkmate. I should have done that two moves ago. I don't know what I was thinking.
0,46,33,O'NEILL,"Yeah, well. You're a little off."
0,46,33,DANIEL,"I don't feel off. I feel. I feel fine. No headaches, no tension, I mean, I feel normal."
0,46,33,O'NEILL,That's because it was just stress. And I have a very calming effect on stressed out people. How about a game of gin?
0,46,33,DANIEL,I'm not very good at gin.
0,46,33,O'NEILL,Good! Get the cards.
0,46,34,DANIEL,Jack?
0,46,34,O'NEILL,Yeah? What?
0,46,34,DANIEL,It's nothing.
0,46,34,O'NEILL,You all right?
0,46,34,DANIEL,I'm fine. How are you feeling?
0,46,35,O'NEILL,Good. Real good.
0,46,36,DANIEL,There's a Goa'uld in you! I've got to get it out!
0,46,36,O'NEILL,Get. There's no Goa'uld in me!
0,46,36,DANIEL,I'm sorry. I saw it. I saw it.
0,46,37,O'NEILL,You all right? Come on.
0,46,38,O'NEILL,"All right, easy, easy, easy. Put your head down."
0,46,41,MACKENZIE,"Don't expect too much. If he becomes agitated, call the aides."
0,46,42,DANIEL,Jack?
0,46,42,CARTER,"It's us, Daniel. Can't you see us?"
0,46,42,DANIEL,"I was just making sure you weren't figments of my mind. They took away my glasses in case I broke the lenses and, uh, tried to, uh, hurt myself."
0,46,42,O'NEILL,Are they treating you okay?
0,46,42,DANIEL,Yeah.
0,46,43,DANIEL,I'm sorry.
0,46,43,O'NEILL,For what?
0,46,43,DANIEL,For being such a headcase.
0,46,43,CARTER,It's not your fault Daniel.
0,46,43,TEAL'C,Colonel O'Neill believes it has something to do with the Linvris.
0,46,43,O'NEILL,You remember in that chamber you said you felt something brush by you?
0,46,43,DANIEL,Yes. It was them. I know you don't believe me but I felt them. They heard me.
0,46,44,DANIEL,They're coming. They're coming.
0,46,44,TEAL'C,"Only your friends are here, Daniel Jackson."
0,46,44,DANIEL,They're coming. I hear footsteps. Footsteps.
0,46,44,O'NEILL,"Daniel, there are no footsteps. Stay with us."
0,46,44,DANIEL,Footsteps!
0,46,46,DANIEL,I told you. That's one of them. He's right there.
0,46,46,TEAL'C,"There is no one at my side, Daniel Jackson."
0,46,46,DANIEL,"Yes, there is."
0,46,46,O'NEILL,Wanna get the aides?
0,46,47,DANIEL,Something just went inside Teal'c.
0,46,47,O'NEILL,You're hallucinating Daniel.
0,46,48,DANIEL,Well don't just stand there! Get it out of him!
0,46,48,MACHELLO,You have delivered me to the vile Goa'uld so that I may destroy him.
0,46,48,DANIEL,Machello!
0,46,48,MACKENZIE,"Okay, let's raise the dose. 5mls at four hour intervals."
0,46,48,DANIEL,Machello.
0,46,49,CARTER,"God, I hate seeing him like that."
0,46,49,O'NEILL,Nothing worse than losing your mind and knowing it's happening.
0,46,50,O'NEILL,Infirmary.
0,46,54,MACHELLO,"Yes, inventions to fight the Goa'uld!"
0,46,55,DANIEL,Machello.
0,46,55,MACHELLO,Yes!
0,46,56,MACHELLO,Yes. Inventions to fight the Goa'uld!
0,46,58,DANIEL,Dr MacKenzie! Dr MacKenzie!
0,46,60,FRAISER,Teal'c symbiote is dying. I can't explain why.
0,46,60,O'NEILL,"Teal'c, what about that kel'no'reem thing?"
0,46,61,HAMMOND,Is he having hallucinations like Dr Jackson?
0,46,61,FRAISER,"No. His dopamine levels are normal. Besides, Daniel didn't have the same physical symptoms. They seem to be unrelated."
0,46,61,O'NEILL,"What are we talking about, timewise?"
0,46,61,FRAISER,"Without another symbiote, a day, two. Maybe less. Even if we found another larval Goa'uld in time, there's no telling if it would survive either."
0,46,63,MACKENZIE,Dr Jackson?
0,46,63,DANIEL,Stop. One second.
0,46,63,MACKENZIE,"Look, Daniel, it's time for your meds."
0,46,63,DANIEL,"I don't, uh, I don't need any more drugs. What I need is the ones you got in my system, out of my system."
0,46,63,MACKENZIE,"No, Daniel. You need rest."
0,46,63,DANIEL,I think I've rested enough. Just tell me one thing. Is Teal'c sick?
0,46,63,MACKENZIE,Not that I'm aware of. I haven't been to the SGC.
0,46,64,MACKENZIE,"Dr Jackson, I insist you calm yourself. Otherwise I'll have to have you restrained and further sedated."
0,46,64,DANIEL,"Why are you so quick to jump to the conclusion I'm crazy? That I'm dangerous, I'm out of control? It's cos I'm kinda acting that way, aren't I? I just need to get these drugs out of my system. Look, Doctor. I know you probably hear this from patients all the time but I think I'm cured."
0,46,64,MACKENZIE,"You're right, I hear that all the time. I'm afraid it doesn't work that way. You don't get well from something like this overnight."
0,46,64,DANIEL,You do if there was an alien organism inside you that was making you think that you were sick when you really weren't.
0,46,64,MACKENZIE,"Mm-hm. And you, uh, found this out how?"
0,46,64,DANIEL,Machello told me.
0,46,64,MACKENZIE,Machello?
0,46,64,DANIEL,He's an alien old man we met on P3C
0,46,64,MACKENZIE,"Dr Jackson, you haven't had any visitors."
0,46,64,DANIEL,"No, of course I haven't. You see, Machello is dead."
0,46,64,MACKENZIE,Dead? Yet he told you there was someone inside you making you appear crazy?
0,46,64,DANIEL,"That's a good point. I wouldn't, uh, I wouldn't buy that if I were you either. Just do me one favour okay? Contact the SGC. Find out if Teal'c is sick. If he is, promise me you'll let me talk to Jack O'Neill."
0,46,66,HAMMOND,Dr MacKenzie seems to think there's some sort of change with Dr Jackson.
0,46,66,FRAISER,"A change, sir?"
0,46,66,HAMMOND,"He's requesting that you come out there, Colonel."
0,46,69,O'NEILL,Hey Daniel.
0,46,69,DANIEL,"You don't, uh, you don't need to walk on eggshells any more. I'm better."
0,46,69,O'NEILL,"So I hear. Uh, it's not that I doubt you, but, um, why do you think it happened all of a sudden?"
0,46,69,DANIEL,"I don't completely understand it myself, but I saw something come out of me and go into Teal'c. And then I heard Machello's voice."
0,46,69,O'NEILL,"Uh, Machello?"
0,46,69,DANIEL,"Just hear me out. I'm guessing it wasn't actually Machello. It was probably some sort of technological or organic recording. It said something about delivering Machello to the vile Goa'uld, which made me start thinking. Maybe I had some sort of Goa'uld killing invention inside of me. One of Machello's inventions."
0,46,69,O'NEILL,And that's what made you nuts?
0,46,69,DANIEL,"Well since I don't have a Goa'uld, a side effect off this invention must make normal people act like they're.."
0,46,69,O'NEILL,Nuts.
0,46,69,DANIEL,Schizophrenic. Look. Teal'c is sick right.
0,46,69,O'NEILL,Right.
0,46,69,DANIEL,Well he does have a Goa'uld.
0,46,71,FRAISER,Your dopamine levels are back to normal.
0,46,71,DANIEL,I'm back to normal.
0,46,71,CARTER,"Okay, let's say your concept about Machello's Goa'uld killing invention is right. Why did it take so long to go into Teal'c?"
0,46,71,DANIEL,"I don't know. Maybe it needed a close proximity to sense his Goa'uld larva. Look, I had a lot of time locked in that little room to think about this. It makes sense. Why am I back to normal? And coincidentally, hours after touching me, Teal'c is sick."
0,46,71,O'NEILL,Why didn't I get sick when we were playing cards the other night and you were jumping all over me?
0,46,71,DANIEL,Because last I heard you don't have a Goa'uld larva.
0,46,71,FRAISER,"All right, but Daniel look, we ran every test we have. MRI, CAT scan, X-rays, full blood work up. There is nothing foreign in Teal'c or his symbiote."
0,46,71,DANIEL,It's there. I know it! I saw it.
0,46,71,CARTER,"Daniel, those bodies had only been there a month. Machello's been dead for six months. How could he be responsible?"
0,46,71,DANIEL,What if he planted those killing devices there six months ago? Or a year ago? Then the Linvris walk into their meeting.
0,46,71,O'NEILL,Like a land mine?
0,46,71,DANIEL,Yes!
0,46,72,DANIEL,"World War I mines are still going off in France today, even though the soldiers that planted them are long since dead."
0,46,72,CARTER,You think that Machello made this thing right?
0,46,72,DANIEL,Right.
0,46,72,CARTER,We crated off everything in Machello's laboratory to Area 51 and it's all in our database. Let's see if we can find something that looks familiar.
0,46,73,O'NEILL,Right there. Right there. Back it up.
0,46,74,DANIEL,I picked that up in the Linvris chamber.
0,46,74,FRAISER,Why did he make so many page turning devices?
0,46,74,CARTER,It could be our landmine.
0,46,76,FRAISER,On the right is the PTD from the Linvris and the one on the left is from Area
0,46,76,CARTER,They look exactly like the one we found on Argos. The Linvris probably thought it was one of their own.
0,46,76,O'NEILL,It's a good way to hide a mine.
0,46,76,CARTER,"Yeah. Question is, how do we set it off?"
0,46,77,FRAISER,"No. Okay. Um, let's see what happens when we use it on the tablet."
0,46,78,FRAISER,"There they are. I'm counting five, ten altogether. So if all PTD's are the same, we're looking at ten per device."
0,46,78,DANIEL,That explains how I got infected. There were nine Linvris.
0,46,78,CARTER,"And when you activated the device, the last one went into you."
0,46,78,FRAISER,Let's try and immobilise one and put it under the scope.
0,46,79,FRAISER,The gloves are breached!
0,46,79,CARTER,Whoa!
0,46,80,O'NEILL,Whoa! Who-whoa!
0,46,80,DANIEL,"General Hammond, B Haz Mat Observation right away!"
0,46,81,FRAISER,No!
0,46,81,O'NEILL,Great.
0,46,82,DANIEL,We have a breach.
0,46,82,HAMMOND,Is there any chance of further contamination to the base?
0,46,82,FRAISER,"Judging what happened to Daniel Sir, as long as we stay in here and don't go near anyone else, the base is probably secure."
0,46,82,HAMMOND,Dr Warner to B Haz Mat Three Observation stat. Containment team to B Haz Mat Three for containment integrity scan.
0,46,82,DANIEL,There has to be an answer in this tablet.
0,46,82,O'NEILL,Is there anything we can do from in here?
0,46,82,FRAISER,Nothing Colonel. All the specimens are inside us. Since we're infected by multiple organisms we can expect our symptoms to be rapidly acute.
0,46,82,O'NEILL,I'd like to apologise in advance for anything I may say or do that could be construed as offensive as I slowly go NUTS!
0,46,82,FRAISER,Likewise Colonel.
0,46,82,CARTER,Colonel? Janet?
0,46,82,O'NEILL,Carter?
0,46,83,CARTER,"Sir, there's nothing wrong with me."
0,46,83,DANIEL,"Sam, you've got four of those things in you."
0,46,83,CARTER,"I know that, but I feel fine."
0,46,83,O'NEILL,You're not seeing or hearing any of this stuff.
0,46,83,CARTER,"No Sir, I feel completely normal. Somehow I must be immune."
0,46,84,WARNER,"Dr Fraiser, what can I do to help?"
0,46,84,FRAISER,Not much I'm afraid.
0,46,84,CARTER,"Doctor, there's nothing wrong with me. Sir, I'd like Dr Warner to take some tests, try to figure out why."
0,46,84,HAMMOND,"I'm afraid that's not possible. That would risk another person being contaminated, if not the entire base."
0,46,84,DANIEL,"Sir, those organisms left my body, I might be immune. I may be the only one who can go in there and help them."
0,46,84,HAMMOND,We don't know that Dr Jackson. I can't let you risk it. Dr Warner will stay here . We'll get whoever else you think can help. But you're going to have to figure it out in there.
0,46,84,CARTER,I understand Sir.
0,46,85,CARTER,"Whoa! Oh, I think I spoke too soon."
0,46,85,DANIEL,What's wrong?
0,46,85,CARTER,"Oh, God, something's happening."
0,46,86,CARTER,"I think they're dead. Daniel, I could have sworn I heard."
0,46,86,DANIEL,Machello?
0,46,86,CARTER,"Yes. He said my Goa'uld captor is dead, but I don't have a Goa'uld."
0,46,86,DANIEL,You did.
0,46,86,CARTER,"That has to be it. Janet said that when a Goa'uld dies, it dissolves into a host and leaves a unique protein marker."
0,46,86,DANIEL,So these Goa'uld killing inventions die because they detect the protein marker? That doesn't make any sense. Why isn't Jack immune? He should have some sort of protein marker left over from Hathor's Goa'uld.
0,46,86,CARTER,"No. No. That Goa'uld left Colonel O'Neill's body and died before it had a chance to take over. Janet, can you hear me? Can we extract my blood and inject it into everyone that's infected."
0,46,86,WARNER,"No, your blood types don't match. You have to separate the protein from the rest of the blood."
0,46,86,CARTER,"Okay, how do I do that?"
0,46,86,WARNER,"You don't have the necessary equipment there. Even if you did, it would take weeks."
0,46,86,CARTER,"Come on, there's gotta be a way! We've got all this stuff."
0,46,86,WARNER,"I'm sorry, but you need to use high pressure liquid chromatography to separate and isolate the protein factions from the rest of the blood. That would yield thirty to forty proteins. Then you'd have to test each one of them to find..."
0,46,86,CARTER,Okay! I get the point.
0,46,86,FRAISER,Centrifuge.
0,46,86,CARTER,What? What about the centrifuge?
0,46,86,FRAISER,Put as much blood as possible in centrifuge.
0,46,87,WARNER,You're wasting your time Major.
0,46,88,CARTER,Okay. Now what?
0,46,88,FRAISER,It's too hot. It's too hot. They're trying to suffocate us.
0,46,88,CARTER,Janet!
0,46,89,FRAISER,No! You're a Goa'uld! Stay away!
0,46,89,CARTER,"I'm not a Goa'uld, Janet. It's me- Sam. I'm your friend."
0,46,89,FRAISER,Put the test tube in the centrifuge.
0,46,90,CARTER,"Janet. Get back with me here! We're trying to separate that protein from my blood, remember? The centrifuge just finished. Now what?"
0,46,90,WARNER,"Major, you're wasting your time. If she thinks there's another way, she's not in her right mind. There's only one way to separate that protein."
0,46,90,FRAISER,You don't need to. Just need to separate red blood cells.
0,46,90,DANIEL,What? What's she talking about?
0,46,90,WARNER,I see where you're going. I see where you're going. Don't even try to separate the proteins. Just separate the rejectable parts and give them all the rest.
0,46,90,DANIEL,What?
0,46,90,WARNER,"The part that makes blood types incompatible is just the red blood cells and a few things in the plasma. If we can get those out, the rest should be safe."
0,46,90,FRAISER,Quick freeze.
0,46,90,CARTER,Quick freeze?
0,46,90,WARNER,"Major, look in the freezer over there. See if there's any dry ice."
0,46,90,CARTER,"Yeah, there's a ton of it."
0,46,90,WARNER,Good. Follow my directions very carefully.
0,46,91,WARNER,Looks good. Pick your first patient.
0,46,91,CARTER,This was your idea. Wanna be first?
0,46,92,O'NEILL,You look terrible.
0,46,92,CARTER,Thank you Sir. I need to give you a shot. Will you let me do that?
0,46,93,CARTER,Janet?
0,46,93,FRAISER,"Uh, I'm hearing."
0,46,93,CARTER,You're hearing Machello?
0,46,93,FRAISER,Yeah. Ahh!
0,46,94,O'NEILL,Ugh!
0,46,97,FRAISER,"Okay. Well, I don't know if this is going to work. He'll have the marker but he'll still have a Goa'uld larva. Depends on how smart Machello made the little beggars."
0,46,98,TEAL'C,Machello!
