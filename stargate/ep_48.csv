0,48,0,"""POINT OF VIEW""",By Jonathan Glassner & Brad Wright A darkened room at Area 51.
0,48,1,SAMANTHA,Major! Come on!
0,48,1,KAWALSKY,We gotta go back for the General!
0,48,1,SAMANTHA,I can't shut it down. I won't find this window again. We have to go now!
0,48,2,KAWALSKY,You sure this is the right one to go to?
0,48,2,SAMANTHA,Anywhere's better than the alternative.
0,48,3,KAWALSKY,I guess we'll see about that.
0,48,4,SF,Drop your weapons! Do it now!
0,48,5,SAMANTHA,I'm Dr Samantha Carter from the SGA. This is Major Kawalsky. We need to speak to your commander.
0,48,6,O'NEILL,"So, what's the big emer.?"
0,48,7,O'NEILL,Whoa! What happened to you?
0,48,7,SAMANTHA,Jack.
0,48,7,O'NEILL,Jack?
0,48,7,SAMANTHA,It's me. It's Sam.
0,48,7,O'NEILL,Uh.. Yeah.
0,48,7,SAMANTHA,I never expected this variation. You're alive.
0,48,7,KAWALSKY,"Don't feel so bad, Colonel. Everybody around here is telling me the same thing."
0,48,7,O'NEILL,Kawalsky?
0,48,7,HAMMOND,In a manner of speaking.
0,48,7,FRAISER,"Actually, in a manner of fact, sir. This is Major Charles Kawalsky in almost every physical respect: his bloodwork, his dental records."
0,48,7,KAWALSKY,"But I'm not supposed to be alive in this reality any more than you are in mine. Sorry, Sam."
0,48,7,SAMANTHA,"It's not the same with us here, is it?"
0,48,7,O'NEILL,Does. anyone wanna let me know what the hell's goin' on here? Anyone?
0,48,7,HAMMOND,They appeared a few hours ago in a Nellis high security lockup.
0,48,7,KAWALSKY,That quantum mirror you got locked up at Area 51? You guys never figured out how to use it?
0,48,7,O'NEILL,Is he talking about that alternate reality thing Daniel futzed with on 233?
0,48,7,KAWALSKY,Who's Daniel?
0,48,7,SAMANTHA,We can't be followed if that's what you're worried about. We brought the remote through with us.
0,48,7,HAMMOND,I've ordered the device sent here under heavy guard.
0,48,7,KAWALSKY,"Where we come from, the Goa'ulds just took over the world, Colonel."
0,48,9,SAMANTHA,"Look, I've told you this. Now let me talk to someone from the SGA."
0,48,9,MAN,
0,48,9,SAMANTHA,Well then you call it something else. The Stargate Project. Stargate Command.
0,48,9,MAN,The Stargate. What do you know about the Stargate?
0,48,9,SAMANTHA,What do I know?! Everything! We've been through this!
0,48,9,MAN,Well let's go through it again.
0,48,9,SAMANTHA,"Oh, for crying out loud!"
0,48,10,SAMANTHA,"It's a big round thing. It takes you to other planets. I made it work four years ago and we have been exploring the galaxy ever since. That is, up until yesterday, when the Goa'uld came and started taking over every major city from orbit and making slaves of the population."
0,48,11,CARTER,Oh my God. This is too weird.
0,48,11,O'NEILL,Yeah. How about that hair?
0,48,11,HAMMOND,She claims to have travelled from an alternate universe in the same manner Dr Jackson experienced a year ago.
0,48,11,DANIEL,Well this can't be the Dr Carter I met in the alternate reality. She 's.. dead.
0,48,11,O'NEILL,All right. Uh. just to clarify. This Carter is from an alternate alternate reality?
0,48,11,DANIEL,Apparently.
0,48,11,O'NEILL,Anybody else have a problem with that?
0,48,11,TEAL'C,Which reality is actually real.
0,48,11,O'NEILL,Thank you Teal'c.
0,48,11,HAMMOND,She explains it.
0,48,12,SAMANTHA,"Look, I know this is hard for you to understand. But, according to quantum theory, for every possible universe, there are an infinite number of variations, diverging at every choice we make like forks in a road."
0,48,12,MAN,Uh-huh.
0,48,13,CARTER,She's right.
0,48,13,O'NEILL,You just agreed with yourself.
0,48,13,DANIEL,"No, actually, Major Carter agreed with Dr Carter. She never joined the military in her reality."
0,48,13,O'NEILL,Fork in the road stuff?
0,48,13,DANIEL,Apparently.
0,48,13,O'NEILL,All right. So it's possible there's an alternate version of myself out there that actually understands what the hell you're talking about?
0,48,13,HAMMOND,They've asked to be debriefed. I'd like you all to participate.
0,48,14,HAMMOND,Show them in.
0,48,15,KAWALSKY,What the hell is he doing here?
0,48,15,O'NEILL,Kawalsky!
0,48,15,DANIEL,He's a member of SG-1.
0,48,15,KAWALSKY,Who the hell are you?
0,48,15,DANIEL,"Oh, um, I'm Daniel Jackson. Also a member of SG-1."
0,48,15,HAMMOND,Have a seat Major.
0,48,16,SAMANTHA,Nice. hair.
0,48,16,CARTER,"Uh, Air Force."
0,48,16,SAMANTHA,I can't imagine that- going military.
0,48,16,CARTER,Wow! I can't imagine not.
0,48,17,HAMMOND,"First of all, I would like to say we know what you've been through. Dr Jackson experienced a similar alternate reality some time ago on a mission to P3X 233."
0,48,17,SAMANTHA,Well that's where we found our quantum mirror as well.
0,48,17,HAMMOND,"Fortunately for us, Dr Jackson was able to return with some intelligence that enabled SG-1 to stop the Goa'uld attack here on Earth."
0,48,17,SAMANTHA,Nice. That goes a long way to explaining why yours was only one of a handful of alternate realities that looked like it hadn't been overrun by the Goa'uld.
0,48,17,CARTER,"Actually, it's probably the very differences that set our universes apart from yours that have contributed to our survival. Daniel's participation in the Stargate programme, Teal'c's change of heart. The fact that I joined the military."
0,48,17,SAMANTHA,You think that your being in the Air Force could have made that big a difference?
0,48,17,CARTER,No. I just said it made a contribution.
0,48,17,SAMANTHA,And therefore I didn't.
0,48,17,O'NEILL,Ladies. Sams. We're all in this reality together.
0,48,17,HAMMOND,What we need to know is where you intend to go from here.
0,48,17,SAMANTHA,Our beta site was instructed to bury their Stargate the moment the last man stepped through. And our own world is under Goa'uld control so we can't go back.
0,48,17,KAWALSKY,We wanna stay.
0,48,17,SAMANTHA,"That is.. if we're wanted. We just left behind everyone we know, everyone we ever cared about. If you're not gonna give us a second chance, I don't know any of you."
0,48,17,O'NEILL,"Well exactly. You don't know any of us. And we don't know you. For all we know. You could be her evil twin. But then we'd be dealing with cliches and you know how I feel about those. No, actually, you know how I feel about those."
0,48,17,HAMMOND,"Okay. I'll speak with my superiors and make a determination. For now, you'll be assigned temporary accommodations. Take them to A3 quarters."
0,48,18,CARTER,"Listen, I didn't mean to offend you back there."
0,48,18,SAMANTHA,"Look Major, I'm the one dealing with the inadequacy issues here. Just forget about it."
0,48,18,CARTER,What?
0,48,18,SAMANTHA,We knew the Goa'uld were coming for 6 months. I couldn't think of a way to stop them. You did.
0,48,19,FEMALE SF,I'll be just outside if you need me Ma'am .
0,48,19,SAMANTHA,Course you will.
0,48,23,HAMMOND,"Yes, Sir. I understand Sir. Thank you Sir. They can stay."
0,48,23,O'NEILL,That was quick.
0,48,23,HAMMOND,Too quick. God knows what we're getting into.
0,48,23,O'NEILL,Well the combined IQ points of Earth might go up a few points having two Carters around.
0,48,24,O'NEILL,I take it you figure there's a down side.
0,48,24,HAMMOND,"It just doesn't sit right. Some lines aren't meant to be crossed. Nonetheless, I've been encouraged to find a way to incorporate them into this command."
0,48,24,O'NEILL,"Okay. In the meantime, do you want me to tell 'em?"
0,48,24,HAMMOND,Very well.
0,48,26,SAMANTHA,Just put it on the table and close the door on your way out.
0,48,26,O'NEILL,I'm sorry. Put what on the table?
0,48,26,SAMANTHA,Jack! I'm sorry. Come in. Your. your Dr Fraiser keeps insisting that I eat something.
0,48,26,O'NEILL,"Ah. Well, she's your Doc Fraiser now too. You're in. They said yes."
0,48,26,SAMANTHA,That's good.
0,48,26,O'NEILL,Yeah. I can see you're overjoyed.
0,48,26,SAMANTHA,I just never expected this. It's so hard.
0,48,26,O'NEILL,"Uh, look. I can't even begin to know what you've been through. I. I know you've lost a lot."
0,48,26,SAMANTHA,"I lost you. I watched you die Jack. Three days ago, trying to defend the mountain. And here you are, alive and safe in this perfect world, and you don't even know me."
0,48,26,O'NEILL,"Well, I. I sort of know you."
0,48,26,SAMANTHA,"You know her. You don't even see her that way, do you?"
0,48,27,O'NEILL,"I take it, where you're from, we were."
0,48,27,SAMANTHA,Married.
0,48,27,O'NEILL,Ah.
0,48,27,SAMANTHA,This makes you uncomfortable.
0,48,27,O'NEILL,"No, no, not at all. I just.. I get confused."
0,48,28,FEMALE SF,Ma'am? Sorry Colonel. I.. I didn't realise.
0,48,28,O'NEILL,Just put it on the table Airman.
0,48,28,FEMALE SF,"Yes, Sir."
0,48,28,O'NEILL,Close the door on your way out.
0,48,29,SAMANTHA,I haven't had a hot meal in forever.
0,48,30,SAMANTHA,It was a couple of weeks ago. We were celebrating our first anniversary. We got the call that the Goa'uld ships had been spotted entering our solar system. We just left everything. You blew out the candles and I turned off the oven and we just left. They didn't hit Colorado Springs from orbit like most of the big cities so the table must still be set.
0,48,30,O'NEILL,Cold by now.
0,48,30,SAMANTHA,Yeah.
0,48,30,O'NEILL,"Listen, um, I should probably be.."
0,48,30,SAMANTHA,Stay!
0,48,30,O'NEILL,Sam.
0,48,30,SAMANTHA,Please.
0,48,30,O'NEILL,"Look..You're dealing with a loss right now that I can't even begin to.. what I mean is, maybe I'm not the right person to help you."
0,48,30,SAMANTHA,"Yes, you are. You're the only one who can. Look.I know you well enough to know you don't have a clue what to say. But you don't have to say anything."
0,48,30,O'NEILL,Come here.
0,48,31,SAMANTHA,"Oh, I miss him."
0,48,33,CARTER,Sir. General Hammond told me the news. I took the liberty of informing Major Kawalsky.
0,48,33,O'NEILL,Thank you. I was just on my way to do that.
0,48,33,CARTER,"I thought I'd drop in on, uh, Samantha. See how she's doing."
0,48,33,O'NEILL,She's fine. I think she'd rather be left alone at the moment. Just stop in tomorrow.
0,48,33,CARTER,"Oh, all right. Well, good night, Sir."
0,48,33,O'NEILL,Carter?
0,48,33,CARTER,Yes Sir?
0,48,33,O'NEILL,How are you doing with this. twin thing?
0,48,33,CARTER,Do you have a couple of hours?
0,48,33,O'NEILL,Okay.
0,48,33,CARTER,That was the answer.
0,48,33,O'NEILL,"Oh, oh."
0,48,33,CARTER,"Good night, Sir."
0,48,34,O'NEILL,"Good night, Major."
0,48,38,CARTER,What is it? What's happening?
0,48,38,FRAISER,Dr Carter has gone into some sort of convulsive shock. I don't know the cause and I don't know how to stop it.
0,48,39,FRAISER,Easy.
0,48,39,SAMANTHA,Not medical. Temporal. Entropic cascade failure.
0,48,39,CARTER,On the cellular level?
0,48,39,SAMANTHA,Yes. I thought it would take years not days.
0,48,39,CARTER,So it's a side effect of travel through the quantum mirror.
0,48,39,KAWALSKY,Then why don't I have it?
0,48,39,CARTER,I'm guessing Dr Carter has it because I'm here. The increased entropy generated by both of us existing in the same reality might theoretically be causing the temporal distortion.
0,48,39,SAMANTHA,Not theoretical any more.
0,48,39,FRAISER,"Okay, so then how do I treat this?"
0,48,39,SAMANTHA,You can't.
0,48,39,CARTER,The more time passes the worse it should get.
0,48,39,SAMANTHA,So I'm gonna die here.
0,48,39,O'NEILL,You're not gonna die.
0,48,39,CARTER,"Actually, sir."
0,48,39,O'NEILL,Carter.
0,48,39,CARTER,Well the only way she won't is if we send her back.
0,48,39,KAWALSKY,"If she goes back, the Goa'uld will kill her."
0,48,40,DANIEL,"Think about it: Billions of people enslaved. I just can't help but feel that in the grand scheme of things, we owe them. Besides the only way to really help Dr Carter is to stop the Goa'uld in her reality and save whatever's left."
0,48,40,HAMMOND,How do you suggest we do that Dr Jackson? The resources of their entire world couldn't defend against the Goa'uld.
0,48,40,DANIEL,What about the resources of our world?
0,48,40,CARTER,What do we have that they don't?
0,48,40,DANIEL,Our fate. We made contact with the Asgard.
0,48,40,O'NEILL,So?
0,48,40,DANIEL,"So if Dr Carter can make contact with the Asgard in her reality, maybe their Asgard will be willing to help them."
0,48,40,HAMMOND,Defend their world against the Goa'uld?
0,48,40,DANIEL,Yes.
0,48,40,O'NEILL,"And just how do you propose we raise the Asgard, in their reality?"
0,48,40,DANIEL,"Okay, we still have the dialling program that took you to the Asgard home planet, right?"
0,48,40,CARTER,"Which we could download to a removable hard drive. But that still won't do it. Remember, in order to dial the Asgard homeworld they had to provide us with a generator to transfer extra energy to the Gate's capacitors. I can't get it to work again. Apparently, it was designed to work only once."
0,48,40,TEAL'C,"Assuming, Major Carter can figure it out, once in her reality it will be difficult to get Dr Carter to the Stargate without the Goa'uld detecting and stopping her."
0,48,40,KAWALSKY,That's where I come in. Permission to join the briefing Sir?
0,48,41,KAWALSKY,I'll get her to the Stargate. What you think I'm gonna let her go alone? She's my best friend's wife.
0,48,42,O'NEILL,You'll need someone to hook up the power generator.
0,48,42,CARTER,And download the dialling program.
0,48,42,TEAL'C,You will also require my assistance.
0,48,42,KAWALSKY,We can handle this.
0,48,42,DANIEL,"No, Teal'c has a point. You said yourself that Teal'c led the assault on the mountain in your reality. Couldn't we use something like that to our advantage?"
0,48,42,O'NEILL,"Quite the military mind, Daniel Jackson."
0,48,42,CARTER,"No, Sir. I'm sorry. Teal'c can't go anymore than I can. Entropic cascade failure. If I go, there will still be two of me in one reality. And the same will be true with Teal'c."
0,48,42,TEAL'C,"Dr Carter did not become ill during her first 48 hours. If our mission is not completed during that time, it is most likely that we will be dead."
0,48,42,O'NEILL,Good point. Are you okay with all this Sir?
0,48,42,HAMMOND,"If you feel confident you can pull this off, I have no objections. However, on your return, I want that quantum mirror destroyed."
0,48,42,DANIEL,"Okay, well this is all well and good, but none of us are going anywhere unless we get that Asgard generator working again."
0,48,42,O'NEILL,"Okay. Carter, download the program to the removable whatever-it-is and meet me and yourself in the lab."
0,48,42,CARTER,Yes Sir.
0,48,43,SAMANTHA,Well this is incredible. If the Asgard could design this to give the Gate extra juice then they're just the little green men we're looking for.
0,48,43,O'NEILL,They're grey actually. Roswell Grey to be exact.
0,48,43,CARTER,I had a hard time trying to figure out how this worked the first time let alone make it work again.
0,48,43,SAMANTHA,If it's powered by the energy module of a staff weapon why doesn't it.
0,48,43,CARTER,Blow up? My best guess is the device creates a modulated dampening field around the liquified naqahdah cell.
0,48,43,SAMANTHA,Which controls the energy transfer to the capacitor. So maybe the modulation is thrown out of whack each time it's activated.
0,48,43,CARTER,That's exactly what I thought! But how do you even begin to recalibrate a field that you can't generate in the first place?
0,48,43,O'NEILL,"Hey, hey, hey, hey! Are you Carters gonna be able to figure this out?"
0,48,43,SAMANTHA/CARTER,We'll figure it out.
0,48,44,SAMANTHA,Aarrgh!
0,48,44,CARTER,We have to figure it out.
0,48,46,KAWALSKY,"Okay, the way Dr C explained it, the controller is not what you'd call an exacting science. You can't just dial up an address like you would on a Stargate. You have to kinda figure out where you are."
0,48,46,DANIEL,I guess it's not a very expedient way to get home.
0,48,46,KAWALSKY,"As long as you don't turn it off, it's always connected to the same reality."
0,48,46,DANIEL,"So when you turn it on again, it won't be connected to the reality you came from?"
0,48,46,KAWALSKY,"Right. We'd have to find it again. Now this thing switches to the various realities. If I turn it on now, it should come up somewhere the reality it was last on."
0,48,47,KAWALSKY,There. See? That's not it. No grenade damage. I tossed a grenade down the hall to slow them down so they didn't see us go through the mirror.
0,48,47,DANIEL,So we need to find a reality that's just right. Do you mind if I.?
0,48,47,KAWALSKY,Oh..
0,48,48,KAWALSKY,"There. See? You probably turned it the wrong way. Since this device should be in a storage closet in my reality, dial it the other way."
0,48,49,KAWALSKY,Change it! Change it! Change it!
0,48,50,KAWALSKY,Okay. Closer. What you wanna do is dial it in smaller increments.
0,48,51,O'NEILL,Daniel? You understand this thing?
0,48,51,DANIEL,I think so.
0,48,51,O'NEILL,Good.
0,48,52,SAMANTHA,Colonel!
0,48,52,CARTER,We did it!
0,48,52,O'NEILL,Already?
0,48,52,SAMANTHA,"Yeah, all we needed was the ratio decay rate of naqahdah relative to the energy output."
0,48,52,CARTER,Which I learned to calculate when I learned about our new naqahdah generator. It's just the ratio.
0,48,52,O'NEILL,"Agh! It works, right?"
0,48,53,CARTER,It works.
0,48,53,O'NEILL,Good.
0,48,53,KAWALSKY,I guess we better go do this.
0,48,55,SAMANTHA,"Yep, that's right. Looks like him."
0,48,55,TEAL'C,I am not fond of wearing this uniform again.
0,48,55,KAWALSKY,Well I'm not too fond of seeing you wear it.
0,48,55,DANIEL,I've searched through all the descriptions of realities close to ours and this has to be it. It's the only one matching your description.
0,48,55,KAWALSKY,Yeah.
0,48,56,CARTER,Wish I could go.
0,48,56,SAMANTHA,"Same here. But you don't wanna go through a cascade tremor, believe me. We made a good team Major."
0,48,56,CARTER,"Yeah, we did Doctor."
0,48,56,SAMANTHA,Plus your hair's kinda grown on me. Pardon the pun.
0,48,56,CARTER,You'd better go.
0,48,57,CARTER,"I'll be here in case you need anything from this side, sir."
0,48,57,O'NEILL,"All right. On three. One, two, three."
0,48,58,EVIL TEAL'C,Jaffa!
0,48,59,EVIL TEAL'C,Jaffa!
0,48,60,EVIL TEAL'C,Kree!
0,48,61,EVIL TEAL'C,Lonok.
0,48,62,EVIL TEAL'C,"Kronok, Jaffa!"
0,48,63,EVIL TEAL'C,Jaffa! Kree! Jaffa!
0,48,64,TEAL'C,Kel nok Teal'c.
0,48,64,EVIL TEAL'C,Kel shak?
0,48,64,TEAL'C,Renounce Apophis as a false God and join us in our deliverance of this world and I will spare you.
0,48,64,EVIL TEAL'C,Shol'va!
0,48,65,O'NEILL,The idea was to zat him.
0,48,65,TEAL'C,As I said O'Neill. Ours is the only reality of consequence.
0,48,67,TEAL'C,Jaffa. Kree!
0,48,68,TEAL'C,Kel toc no.
0,48,71,O'NEILL,All right. I gotta know.
0,48,71,DANIEL,"Yes, I'm about to activate it."
0,48,71,O'NEILL,"No, no, no. Not that. What the hell does Kree mean?"
0,48,71,DANIEL,"Well, actually, it means a lot of things. Uh, loosely translated it means ""attention,"" ""listen up,"" ""concentrate."""
0,48,71,O'NEILL,Yoo-hoo?
0,48,71,DANIEL,"Yes, in a manner of speaking."
0,48,71,O'NEILL,Oh.
0,48,71,DANIEL,"Okay, here goes."
0,48,72,DANIEL,"That's what I was afraid of. When I turned off the device, it lost it's place. I have to find our reality all over again."
0,48,72,O'NEILL,All right. It's okay. We knew that might happen. Stay with it.
0,48,76,APOPHIS,"I will ask you this one more time, human. What is the address of the planet to which your leaders have fled? The place you call ""beta site""."
0,48,77,AU HAMMOND,Aaarrghhh!!
0,48,77,APOPHIS,Where have your leaders gone?
0,48,78,TEAL'C,Kel Apophis.
0,48,78,APOPHIS,Teal'c. Who is this?
0,48,78,TEAL'C,"She was captured attempting a escape, my lord."
0,48,78,APOPHIS,This one will not tell us the glyphs for the planet where they've sent their leaders. Get it out of him. Or get it out of her.
0,48,78,TEAL'C,"Yes, my lord."
0,48,80,TEAL'C,Attend to our lord. I will take care of these. Kree Jaffa!
0,48,81,AU HAMMOND,You might as well kill me.
0,48,81,TEAL'C,I would never do such a thing General Hammond.
0,48,81,SAMANTHA,It's okay. You're not hallucinating. He's from an alternate reality.
0,48,81,AU HAMMOND,So that mirror thing worked?
0,48,81,SAMANTHA,"Yeah. But don't worry. I won't say ""I told you so""."
0,48,81,AU HAMMOND,We should have tried it a long time ago Doctor.
0,48,82,TEAL'C,They have landed on the mountain.
0,48,82,SAMANTHA,There's still a chance we can stop them Sir. We're gonna attempt to contact a race of aliens that they have in their reality. Enemies of the Goa'uld.
0,48,86,DANIEL,Whoops! Too far.
0,48,87,DANIEL,"Come on, please."
0,48,89,KAWALSKY,"The Carters are pretty smart figuring that thing out, huh? So you and Sam, you never had a thing in your world, huh?"
0,48,89,O'NEILL,Sam is a Major in my world.
0,48,89,KAWALSKY,"Yeah, I know. It's against regulations, right? You two look pretty good together, let me tell you."
0,48,89,O'NEILL,"Kawalsky? During your Special Ops training, in your world, did they cover silence?"
0,48,91,DANIEL,Yes.
0,48,92,DANIEL,You're a Captain.
0,48,93,DANIEL,Close.
0,48,95,SAMANTHA,"Okay, now."
0,48,96,SAMANTHA,I hope your Jack is good enough to get the transformer on line.
0,48,100,TEAL'C,It appears that he is.
0,48,101,TEAL'C,"You must prepare to go through the Gate, Dr Carter."
0,48,102,SAMANTHA,"Thank you, Teal'c."
0,48,104,TEAL'C,Jaffa! Kree hol mel! Hol mel Jaffa!
0,48,105,APOPHIS,Teal'c.
0,48,106,APOPHIS,Why do you betray me?
0,48,109,JAFFA,Lower your weapons or we will kill him.
0,48,109,KAWALSKY,Colonel?
0,48,109,O'NEILL,"Yeah, we should do that."
0,48,112,DANIEL,Déjà vu.
0,48,112,APOPHIS,Who are you? My First Prime killed you before my very eyes.
0,48,112,O'NEILL,"I'm feeling much better, thank you."
0,48,112,APOPHIS,Then who are you? What magic is this?
0,48,112,DANIEL,"You should know better than anyone, there's no such thing as magic."
0,48,112,APOPHIS,Trey lan tonik.
0,48,113,APOPHIS,I will ask you one more time. How could you have risen from the dead without a sarcophagus?
0,48,114,O'NEILL,"All right, I'm guessin' the second shot kills in this world too, huh?"
0,48,114,APOPHIS,Tell me what I want to know!
0,48,114,O'NEILL,Hey. I'd love to. But I don't understand it myself. He does.
0,48,114,DANIEL,"Okay, I'll, uh, I'll give it a try. Um, you see, at every point in time, there are infinite possibilities. A parallel reality exists for each possibility so there are literally infinite branches."
0,48,115,KAWALSKY,
0,48,116,O'NEILL,Kawalsky!
0,48,116,APOPHIS,Tell me where you come from.
0,48,116,DANIEL,From an alternate reality.
0,48,116,O'NEILL,"One in which, by the way, you're dead."
0,48,117,O'NEILL,Aw come on!
0,48,117,KAWALSKY,He told you everything he knows!
0,48,118,JAFFA2,"My lord. Tel kol, Apophis. Kree no tel, Reenlokia!"
0,48,120,APOPHIS,Mel tok nee!
0,48,122,O'NEILL,"Okay, I'm guessin'."
0,48,122,DANIEL,Asgard.
0,48,122,O'NEILL,All right.
0,48,124,TEAL'C,It appears Dr Carter was successful.
0,48,124,O'NEILL,Come on. Ya gotta love those guys!
0,48,125,SAMANTHA,I met the Asgard.
0,48,125,O'NEILL,We guessed that.
0,48,126,O'NEILL,Love those guys.
0,48,128,KAWALSKY,"Colonel, it's been a pleasure to serve with you. again."
0,48,128,O'NEILL,Likewise.
0,48,128,KAWALSKY,"Right, right."
0,48,129,SAMANTHA,This is hard. Goodbye for a second time.
0,48,129,O'NEILL,It's the first time.
0,48,129,SAMANTHA,"It doesn't feel that way to me. You have to understand. My Jack had the same face, same voice, same hands."
0,48,129,O'NEILL,Which brings to mind an obvious question. How could you marry such a loser?
0,48,130,SAMANTHA,Thank you.
0,48,130,DANIEL,You're welcome.
0,48,132,SAMANTHA,"You're really not him, are you?"
0,48,132,O'NEILL,No.
0,48,132,SAMANTHA,I just wish...
0,48,132,O'NEILL,Yeah.
