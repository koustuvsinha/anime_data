0,5,10,SAM,"""The samples we brought back are being analyzed and we explored a ten kilometer radius around the gate without finding any sign of recent Goa'uld mining activity. In fact there is no indication that Goa'ulds or anyone else have been through that gate in a thousand years."""
0,5,10,HAMMOND,"""Tell me about these crystals."""
0,5,10,DANIEL,"""We found thousands in a pit near the Stargate. Since we didn't find them anywhere else on the planet, it's likely that they were gathered and put there."""
0,5,10,HAMMOND,"""Why?"""
0,5,10,DANIEL,"""Early Greek cultures valued crystals and gemstones, perhaps the pit has some religious or ceremonial significance."""

0,5,18,SCIENTIST,"""Passed all the decontamination protocols, but I noticed it's got a low level EM field you should check out. Either that or my fridge magnets fell of the wall by themselves."""

0,5,18,DANIEL,"""Sara? I don't think they've seen each other since he joined SG1. He hasn't said anything about a visit but like I said."

If it helps you.I'm glad you're here.You know, Jack, for an Irishman you never were much of a talker but that never mattered. I'll give you that much, you married my daughter. Say what you need to Charlie if that's all you've come her for, but Sara is not over you yet, so you break her heart again and, God help you, I'll make you wish you never did."""

0,5,34,SAM,"""Oh yeah."""
0,5,34,DANIEL,"""Absolutely."""
0,5,35,SAM,"""Now, I noticed that the glassy edge where the crystal was melted looked a lot like the walls of the gate room after Apophis and his serpent guards came and shot up the place. Now, take a look at this. We did a complete study trying to figure out what they used. We kept a few pieces and that gave me the idea."""
0,5,35,DANIEL,"""Since your energy weapons are the same as the ones Apophis used, we can compare the blast marks on the two crystals."""
0,5,35,SAM,"""Now, I'm telling the computer to build a simulation model. We should see if the energy signatures are the same or not."""

I feared it, as I feared those who destroyed my race. I tried to make you well before my mistake was discovered, before the others returned to destroy me. I understand now. Your deepest pain was not the physical injury I had caused. Your pain was from an empty place in your heart where Charlie once was. I thought if I could bring Charlie to you, it would make you well.
