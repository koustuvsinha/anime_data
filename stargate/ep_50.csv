0,50,0,"""DEMONS""",By Carl Binder
0,50,1,O'NEILL,"Ah trees, trees and more trees. What a wonderfully green universe we live in eh? Where's that village?"
0,50,1,CARTER,The UAV found it eleven klicks Southwest of here.
0,50,1,O'NEILL,Eleven?
0,50,2,TEAL'C,Here. This path is well travelled.
0,50,2,DANIEL,Which means the STARGATE is still in use by someone.
0,50,2,O'NEILL,Or.something.
0,50,4,CARTER,"The UAV photos were right, there it is. Looks like a church."
0,50,4,O'NEILL,And that would mean what?
0,50,4,TEAL'C,That it is most likely Christians reside here.
0,50,4,O'NEILL,Thank you TEAL'C. C
0,50,4,ARTER,"Well, this is the first sign of Christianity we've encountered, Sir, in hundreds of missions."
0,50,4,DANIEL,Which means they probably had to have been taken from somewhere in medieval Europe through the Antarctic gate.
0,50,4,TEAL'C,By which Goa'uld?
0,50,4,DANIEL,That's a good question.
0,50,5,DANIEL (CONT'D),"Most Goa'uld that we've encountered that have enslaved ancient human populations have taken on the roles of those cultures' deities. RA, APOPHIS, HATHOR from the Egyptian pantheon."
0,50,5,O'NEILL,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got it."
0,50,5,DANIEL,"Well, if these people were already Christians when they were taken from Earth, that suggests this Goa'uld is.is playing."
0,50,5,O'NEILL,"God? As in GOD God? It's a bit of a stretch, don't you think?"
0,50,5,TEAL'C,I know of no Goa'uld capable of showing the necessary compassion or benevolence that I have read of in your Bible.
0,50,5,O'NEILL,"You read the Bible, TEAL'C?"
0,50,5,TEAL'C,It is a significant part of your Western culture. Have you not read the Bible
0,50,5,O'NEILL,"Oh yeah, yeah, not all of it. Actually, I'm listening to it on tape. Don't tell me how it ends."
0,50,6,DANIEL,Hello? We're not going to hurt you.
0,50,7,DANIEL,We're peaceful travellers.
0,50,7,O'NEILL,They're not buying it Danny.
0,50,8,O'NEILL,Is this English?
0,50,8,DANIEL,"Middle English, pre-Chaucer. 'Show mercy to those who are about to be delivered unto the devil.'. It's a.a derivative of the Catholic prayer for Suffering Souls."
0,50,10,MAN,Spare her please!
0,50,10,DANIEL,"Oh, we're not going to hurt her. Or you. We're friends. I'm DANIEL."
0,50,10,MAN,I am SIMON. You have come through the Circle of Darkness?
0,50,10,CARTER,The STARGATE? Yes.
0,50,10,SIMON,"Then you must be of his brethren. I beg of you, MARY is so young. She did nothing to warrant Sacrifice."
0,50,10,O'NEILL,Whoa. What sacrifice?
0,50,10,SIMON,"If you leave her body, the village CANON may choose another possessed soul."
0,50,10,DANIEL,You think we're demons. He.thinks we're demons.
0,50,10,O'NEILL,"Uh-huh. Well, we're not demons. We're human, like you. From Earth, like you."
0,50,10,DANIEL (TO SIMON),Do other demons come through the Circle?
0,50,10,SIMON,You know he does.
0,50,10,DANIEL,"Uh, no, we don't know anything about him, but we'd like to. What does he look like?"
0,50,10,SIMON,Mostly he comes in his true form. But demons can take many shapes.
0,50,11,TEAL'C,Major CARTER. Shield her eyes.
0,50,12,SIMON (TO MARY),Go into the house! Quickly!
0,50,13,SIMON,"Leave her body, please."
0,50,13,O'NEILL,"Come on, get up."
0,50,13,SIMON,Take me in her place!
0,50,13,O'NEILL,"Look, stop that, will ya? Come on. Let's go, come on."
0,50,14,O'NEILL,"Listen to me. We're not demons. And MARY is not possessed. From the looks of it, she's a little sick. If you let us, we might be able to help."
0,50,16,O'NEILL,Chickenpox. Trust me.
0,50,16,CARTER,Her fever's pretty high.
0,50,16,O'NEILL,"It'll break. Those spots will get itchy, but that's about as bad as it'll get. You'll be fine in a couple of days."
0,50,16,SIMON,That won't be soon enough. The time of Sacrifice is at hand. The elders will have to perform the trepanning ritual tonight to cleanse her.
0,50,16,DANIEL,Oh jeez.
0,50,16,O'NEILL,What?
0,50,16,DANIEL,"It was a procedure often done in the Middle Ages. They.well they drill a hole in the person's head. By drilling a hole, the evil spirits are released, thus saving the person from eternal damnation."
0,50,16,O'NEILL,Thus.saving the person?
0,50,16,DANIEL,"Well, they didn't call them the Dark Ages because it was dark."
0,50,18,SIMON (PRAYING),"My Jesus, let the sorrows you suffered."
0,50,18,VILLAGER (OUTSIDE),)The demon comes!
0,50,18,VILLAGER,The demon comes!
0,50,19,O'NEILL,The demon comes?
0,50,21,O'NEILL,Damn. Unas?
0,50,21,TEAL'C,You are correct O'NEILL. The first host of the Goa'uld.
0,50,21,O'NEILL,"No, no, no.we killed him, he's dead."
0,50,21,TEAL'C,We only killed one Unas.
0,50,21,O'NEILL,"I thought there only was one. Unas, uno.one."
0,50,21,TEAL'C,They are in fact a species.
0,50,22,UNAS (OUTSIDE),The time of Sacrifice is at hand. My lord Satan calls for five wretched souls to reclaim as his.
0,50,22,O'NEILL,Satan?
0,50,22,SOKAR.,
0,50,22,CARTER,Gathering host bodies.
0,50,22,UNAS (OUTSIDE),"At sunrise shall I return to claim the five. If you have not chosen, I shall take whom I please in far greater numbers."
0,50,22,DANIEL,I think we were wrong about this Goa'uld. He isn't playing God. He's playing the devil.
0,50,23,SIMON,The time is at hand.
0,50,23,MARY,"No! No, no!"
0,50,24,SIMON.,
0,50,24,SIMON,
0,50,24,O'NEILL,The creature that just sauntered through your village is called an Unas.
0,50,25,SIMON,The time of Sacrifice has been declared. I feared it would be.
0,50,25,O'NEILL,
0,50,26,O'NEILL,"Look, we've run into this kind of thing before. Now, it's not a demon. It's demonesque I'll grant you, but it's just a big, ugly creature."
0,50,26,O'NEILL,"Yes. It's a very smart, resilient creature."
0,50,26,DANIEL (QUIETLY),"In the service of SOKAR, who, for all intents and purposes, is Satan to these people."
0,50,26,O'NEILL,But it's not a demon.
0,50,26,DANIEL (TO SIMON),"No, it's not a demon."
0,50,26,TEAL'C,"My friends speak the truth, SIMON. This demon is nothing more than a parasite that inhabits another creature. Your fear is its greatest power over you."
0,50,26,SIMON,You do not fear it?
0,50,26,TEAL'C,We do not.
0,50,27,SIMON,You say you have killed an Unas once before?
0,50,27,TEAL'C,Indeed.
0,50,27,SIMON,Then perhaps God has sent you. Perhaps you are the answer to our prayers. All my life I have asked God to deliver us from this evil.
0,50,27,O'NEILL,So what did the lizard say? That he'd be back at sunrise?
0,50,27,TEAL'C,Are you contemplating attack O'NEILL?
0,50,27,O'NEILL,"Yeah, sure, why not."
0,50,27,TEAL'C,An Unas is difficult to destroy.
0,50,27,O'NEILL,"Couple of shots with a staff, we own him."
0,50,27,CARTER,We hope. It took Thor's Hammer to kill the last one.
0,50,27,O'NEILL,"Alright, a whole bunch of shots with a staff. DANIEL, how long have these people been living like this?"
0,50,27,DANIEL,"Well, I can't be sure without proper reference."
0,50,27,DANIEL,At least.
0,50,27,O'NEILL,That's long enough. These people are being terrorised. We have the power to stop it.
0,50,27,TEAL'C,
0,50,27,O'NEILL,"Alright, so we'll have them bury the Gate after we've gone."
0,50,27,DANIEL,They could come in ships.
0,50,27,O'NEILL,Ships?
0,50,27,CARTER,"I can't be sure, but the co-ordinates of this planet are years away from any known Goa'uld Homeworld, even with their faster ships."
0,50,27,O'NEILL,
0,50,27,SIMON,Are we not in God's hands?
0,50,28,SIMON,The CANON has returned.
0,50,29,SIMON (TO O'NEILL),The CANON will choose those for Sacrifice tonight.
0,50,29,O'NEILL,Why does he get to choose?
0,50,29,SIMON,He is our spiritual leader. It falls to him to determine those of us whose souls are already possessed with evil.
0,50,30,CANON (TO SG1),"You have come down the path, through the Circle of Darkness?"
0,50,30,O'NEILL,Something like that. My name's Jack
0,50,30,SIMON,"Yes, but I do not believe they mean us harm."
0,50,30,CANON,"The tricks of Satan and his minions are many. And only those weak of faith are fooled by such deception. By granting them entrance, you have spilled the blood of your people!"
0,50,31,CANON,"This one! There's the mark of the devil! If you are human as you say, then your souls are damned."
0,50,31,TEAL'C,It appears they do not desire our assistance
0,50,31,O'NEILL,"Yeah, fine, whatever. Have a nice day."
0,50,32,CANON,You shall be struck down!
0,50,33,SIMON,"No, no CANON."
0,50,35,CARTER,"Sir, I've been disarmed."
0,50,35,O'NEILL,"Yeah, I picked up on that too. TEAL'C'S gone."
0,50,36,DANIEL,Did we just get struck by a big bolt of.lightning?
0,50,36,CARTER,That's what it looked like. Felt more like a zat blast to me. He.touched his ring just before the lightning started.
0,50,36,O'NEILL,
0,50,37,SIMON,"I do not believe you are demons. I've said as much to the CANON, but he refuses to hear me."
0,50,37,O'NEILL,Where's our friend?
0,50,37,SIMON,It has been decided he must endure the tests.
0,50,37,O'NEILL,What tests?
0,50,38,CANON (TO TEAL'C),What have you to say for yourself?
0,50,38,TEAL'C,That I do not serve those whom you would call demon.
0,50,38,TEAL'C.,
0,50,38,SIMON (TO O'NEILL),"Say nothing more, or they will kill him."
0,50,38,CANON (CONT'D),"For this reason, we are commanded by God to seek out those spirits and punish them!"
0,50,39,DANIEL,The mark of the devil.
0,50,39,O'NEILL,What?
0,50,39,DANIEL,"Uh, in the Middle Ages one of the proofs of witchcraft was a mark on the body supposedly made by the devil himself that was insensitive to pain."
0,50,40,CANON,The first proof is given!
0,50,40,DANIEL?,
0,50,40,DANIEL,It's not good.
0,50,41,CANON,And they went up on the breath of the Earth. And fire came down from God out of Heaven and devoured them.
0,50,41,DANIEL,The water test.
0,50,41,O'NEILL,What?
0,50,41,DANIEL,"Common practice in the Middle Ages. They weighed a person and threw them in the water. If he sinks, he's innocent."
0,50,41,CARTER,"If he floats, he's guilty of witchcraft and burned at the stake. It's Catch22."
0,50,42,CANON,"Archangel, Saint Michael, defend us in battle. Thrust into hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl upon the Earth. Amen."
0,50,43,DANIEL,We'll go back where we came from!
0,50,43,CARTER,He's innocent!
0,50,44,CANON,God's will.has been done.
0,50,46,CANON,Your friend's soul is clean. If you wish he'll be given a Christian burial.
0,50,46,O'NEILL,What?
0,50,46,CANON,"You're free to go. I insist only that you remain in chains until your return through the Circle of Darkness, to whatever dark place you reside and that you never return."
0,50,46,O'NEILL,Because you know if I did return I'd break your damn neck. But of course you could just touch that lovely ring of yours and we'd all be struck down again.
0,50,46,CANON,Ah the ring. It has been handed down through generations of village canons who came before me.
0,50,46,DANIEL,And with it you maintain power.
0,50,46,CANON,"With it I abide by God's will, as best I can. Sacrifices must be made."
0,50,46,DANIEL,Why?
0,50,46,CANON,Do you deny the demon is real? Do you deny that it could destroy us if it so wished?
0,50,47,CANON (CONT'D),"The Sacrifices allowed the people of this village to survive for generations. Just as the wheat is separated from the chaff, the unclean souls among us must be taken away, through the Circle of Darkness. Forever."
0,50,47,O'NEILL,And you decide.
0,50,47,CANON,Yes I do. Now go thy way. Trouble me no more.
0,50,48,SIMON,I am sorry.
0,50,48,O'NEILL,"You know SIMON, your village CANON has an awfully interesting way of tending the flock."
0,50,48,SIMON,Speak no more of this.
0,50,48,DANIEL,He maintains power by controlling who gets Sacrificed and who doesn't.
0,50,48,SIMON,No more! I have asked for this dispensation and he has granted it.
0,50,49,O'NEILL (TO SIMON),Where's our gear?
0,50,49,SIMON,"If I were to bring it to you, would you help us?"
0,50,49,O'NEILL,Help you?
0,50,49,CARTER,You can bury the STARGATE after we've gone through. That should prevent the Unas and anything else from.
0,50,49,SIMON,I cannot do that!
0,50,49,DANIEL,Well there must be other people who are willing.
0,50,49,SIMON,"I mean the Circle. We are not allowed to go near it, or even look upon it."
0,50,50,VILLAGER,
0,50,50,SIMON,I shall be there.
0,50,50,DANIEL,Ready? Ready for what?
0,50,50,SIMON,"The trepanning ritual. MARY'S parents were taken in a Sacrifice a year ago. They asked that I care for her. If you're not willing to help, it falls to me to try to cleanse her soul before the CANON chooses."
0,50,50,DANIEL,You can't do that.
0,50,50,SIMON,I have no choice.
0,50,50,DANIEL,You'll kill her.
0,50,50,SIMON,Better that she die among us than at the hands of the devil himself.
0,50,51,DANIEL,Jack.
0,50,51,O'NEILL,No.
0,50,51,DANIEL,We can't condemn a young girl just because one man has made a pact with the devil. TEAL'C will have died for nothing if nothing good comes from this.
0,50,52,SIMON (TO MARY),There shall be a great reward waiting for you in Heaven and the angels will welcome you with joyful hearts. And there will be no more pain.
0,50,52,MARY,I know.
0,50,52,DANIEL,"Ok, I'll tell you what. You guys start back without me. I'm just going to go see if I can stop these people from a drilling a hole in the head of a young girl."
0,50,54,DANIEL,Wait!
0,50,55,DANIEL,"We'll take you back with us. MARY too. Where we come from, there are no demons."
0,50,57,O'NEILL,Good choice.
0,50,59,CARTER,Fever's down. Feeling any better?
0,50,59,MARY,Yes. Have you released that which possessed me?
0,50,59,CARTER,You got better all by yourself MARY. There was never a demon inside you.
0,50,60,O'NEILL,So SIMON. You wouldn't happen to have the keys to these would you? Keys?
0,50,62,O'NEILL,What's that?
0,50,62,SIMON,I don't know.
0,50,63,DANIEL,
0,50,63,TEAL'C,It is so.
0,50,64,TEAL'C,My symbiote did sustain me.
0,50,64,CARTER,Oxygen in the water. It's the larval Goa'uld's natural environment. It must have filtered the oxygen and fed it into TEAL'C. You were out for a long time TEAL'C. I thought we'd lost you.
0,50,64,TEAL'C,"When I realised they planned to immerse me, I put myself in a deep state of Kel'no'reem."
0,50,65,O'NEILL,You think these folks never saw a guy rise from the dead.
0,50,65,CANON,Yes there is!
0,50,66,CANON,There can be no doubt now. They are evil. All of them.
0,50,66,CANON,These four shall be the first chosen for Sacrifice.
0,50,66,O'NEILL,"Major, next time DANIEL gets the urge to help someone, shoot him."
0,50,67,CANON,And with them shall be taken the woman whose soul has been possessed.
0,50,68,CANON,You challenge my decision?
0,50,68,SIMON,No.
0,50,69,MARY,
0,50,70,SIMON,I am sorry MARY.
0,50,70,O'NEILL,Don't apologise to her. Help her!
0,50,70,SIMON,The CANON has spoken.
0,50,70,O'NEILL,"What are you, the village idiot?"
0,50,70,DANIEL (TO SIMON),The demon will turn her into a host. You know what that means. Course you don't know what that means.
0,50,70,SIMON,I can hear no more of this.
0,50,72,DANIEL,Jack.
0,50,72,O'NEILL,
0,50,73,DANIEL (TO O'NEILL),"I don't think anything we say is going to make a difference, especially not after TEAL'C'S.resurrection."
0,50,76,VILLAGER (TO SIMON),"If they truly are servants of Satan, why does he resist."
0,50,76,UNAS (TO O'NEILL),You are not of this world.
0,50,78,DANIEL (QUIETLY),
0,50,79,O'NEILL,Go! Go!
0,50,81,CANON,
0,50,83,UNAS,You cannot escape me.
0,50,84,SIMON (TO THE UNAS),Leave them!
0,50,84,UNAS,You dare to challenge me?
0,50,84,O'NEILL (TO SIMON),Shoot it!
0,50,84,UNAS (TO SIMON),You shall join them in hell.
0,50,85,SIMON!,
0,50,85,UNAS (TO SG1),You will remain here until I finish with this one.
0,50,86,O'NEILL (TO SIMON),Shoot it!
0,50,86,SIMON!,
0,50,86,O'NEILL,Shoot!
0,50,87,O'NEILL,Again!
0,50,88,O'NEILL (TO SIMON),Shoot!
0,50,89,UNAS,For this you will pay with your life.
0,50,90,SIMON!,
0,50,91,O'NEILL,
0,50,92,O'NEILL.,
0,50,95,O'NEILL,
0,50,95,CARTER,Yes Sir.
0,50,96,O'NEILL (TO TEAL'C),Shall we?
0,50,98,CANON,
0,50,98,SIMON,The demon comes. Release me.
0,50,100,UNAS (TO SIMON),Your God has abandoned you.
0,50,101,SIMON,My GOD is with me always.
0,50,103,O'NEILL,He's alright. What happened?
0,50,103,CANON,SIMON.stood before it like.like David before Goliath. The demon threw him aside and then he fell. As you can see.
0,50,104,CANON,It was a miracle.
0,50,104,TEAL'C,The Unas' wounds were too severe. Even the Goa'uld within him could not save him.
0,50,104,CANON,As you say. You've opened my eyes. Bless you.
0,50,104,O'NEILL,"Yeah, well. Let's have the ring."
0,50,104,CANON,Yes. Of course.
0,50,105,SIMON,I'm alive?
0,50,105,TEAL'C,
0,50,105,O'NEILL (TO SIMON),Which is why you've got to bury the Circle of Darkness after we've gone through. Can you walk?
0,50,107,SIMON!,
0,50,108,MARY,I knew you would come. Are you hurt?
0,50,108,SIMON,I will be fine.
0,50,108,DANIEL,What happened?
0,50,108,CANON,"The beast.is dead. Had I not witnessed it myself, I would not have believed it. Thank you.all, for showing me the way."
0,50,108,O'NEILL,"You're welcome. Major, dial us home."
0,50,109,CARTER?,
0,50,110,CARTER,It went into him.
0,50,110,SIMON,What went into him?
0,50,111,TEAL'C,Go no further!
0,50,111,CANON,Why? I have done nothing. My children.
0,50,111,O'NEILL (TO CARTER),Are you sure?
0,50,111,CARTER,"Positive, Sir. I can sense it. The Unas host was dying, it had no where else to go. It went into him."
0,50,112,CANON,Forgive me.
0,50,113,SIMON (PRAYING),"By the sorrows he suffered, in your agony in the garden, they scourged and crowned him with thorns."
0,50,113,DANIEL,The prayer for Suffering Souls.
0,50,113,SIMON (CONT'D),"In your crucifixion and death, have mercy on the souls. Deliver them from the dire torments they endure and admit them to your most sweet embrace in Paradise."
0,50,114,SIMON,Now the demon is truly gone.
0,50,114,O'NEILL,Major?
0,50,115,MARY,Yes. We will do what you say.
0,50,115,SIMON,We will bury the Gate. Immediately. And there will be no more Sacrifices.
0,50,115,O'NEILL,Thank God.
