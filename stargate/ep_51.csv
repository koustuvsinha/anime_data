0,51,0,"""RULES OF ENGAGEMENT""",By Terry Curtis Fox Transcribed by
0,51,1,ONEILL,"You know, that UAV needs a swift kick in the CPU."
0,51,1,CARTER,Aerial camera showed some sort of camp.
0,51,2,CARTER,That sounded like weapons fire.
0,51,2,CARTER,"Theyre SG teams, sir. Cant make out their unit number. Theyre pinned down."
0,51,2,TEALC,They are not returning fire.
0,51,2,CARTER,Out of ammo?
0,51,2,ONEILL,Maybe. Theyre not supposed to be here at all.
0,51,2,SG-11?,
0,51,2,CARTER,"They were declared MIA eight months ago, on P89 354. What would they be doing here?"
0,51,2,TEALC,"Whoever they may be, they are about to die."
0,51,3,ONEILL,Pull out! Well cover your six!
0,51,3,CAPTAIN,Identify yourself!
0,51,3,ONEILL,"Colonel Jack ONeill, SG-1!"
0,51,3,CAPTAIN,Which Quadrant?
0,51,3,ONEILL,Get out of there!
0,51,3,CAPTAIN (TO HIS MEN),Take them out!
0,51,4,ONEILL,Everybody okay?
0,51,4,DANIEL,Headache. Bad headache.
0,51,4,CARTER,I thought I got shot.
0,51,4,TEALC,So it would seem.
0,51,4,CARTER,Must be some kind of stun weapons.
0,51,4,ONEILL,"Looked like MP-5s to me. Well, all I can say is ..."
0,51,5,ONEILL,Hello.
0,51,5,HIBBARD,"Boy, are you guys gonna get it!"
0,51,5,ONEILL,Get what? From whom?
0,51,5,HIBBARD,"Hey, you cant talk!"
0,51,5,ONEILL,Why not?
0,51,5,HIBBARD,Because youre dead!
0,51,5,ONEILL,Dead?
0,51,5,HIBBARD,Pretending not to be dead will just get you into more trouble.
0,51,5,ONEILL,More trouble than dead?
0,51,5,HIBBARD,"Come on, Colonel, you know better. Stop breaking the rules."
0,51,5,ONEILL,Sorry. Whos in charge here?
0,51,5,HIBBARD,Casualties dont ask questions.
0,51,5,CARTER,"Uh, what rules are we talking about exactly?"
0,51,6,HIBBARD,"I said, stop!"
0,51,6,DANIEL,"Were just trying to understand, if were supposed to be dead, how are you supposed to kill us again?"
0,51,7,DANIEL (QUIETLY),Four-eyes?
0,51,7,ONEILL,"Easy, big fella. Just ... play dead."
0,51,7,TEALC,Indeed.
0,51,7,HIBBARD,Captains waiting for you. Follow me.
0,51,7,ONEILL,Anyone notice the patch?
0,51,7,SG-X.,
0,51,7,TEALC,"There *is* no SG-X, ONeill."
0,51,7,ONEILL,"Not under Hammonds command, no."
0,51,7,HIBBARD,Hey! I *said* follow me.
0,51,8,TEALC,They are no more than children.
0,51,8,CARTER,"Playing some kind of war game, by the looks of things. Who do you think they are? NID, Colonel Maybourne?"
0,51,8,ONEILL,I wouldnt put it past him.
0,51,8,HIBBARD (SALUTING),
0,51,8,ONEILL,Would that be Daylight Savings or Standard?
0,51,8,CAPTAIN,"You may not speak. Except to answer a direct question by the evaluating officer. Is that *CLEAR*?! Is this the way you behave in your quadrant, mister?"
0,51,8,ONEILL,"I think Colonel is the proper way of addressing me, *Captain*."
0,51,8,CAPTAIN,"No rank is above strict adherence to the Rules of Engagement. Rule 2, Article 4. Unauthorised forces shall be shot on sight. You were unauthorised. In fact, you ruined our ambush. Nearly half the enemy team got away!"
0,51,8,ONEILL,"Carter, Ive never been real big on regs. Is this familiar to you?"
0,51,8,CARTER,"No, sir."
0,51,8,TEALC,"They are familiar to *me*. Gelvak, Jaffa."
0,51,8,CAPTAIN (STARTLED),Youre not from D Quadrant.
0,51,8,TEALC,We are not.
0,51,8,CAPTAIN,You came through the chappaai. This is a challenge!
0,51,8,DANIEL,The ... chappaai?
0,51,8,ONEILL,Oy.
0,51,8,CAPTAIN,"Stargate. Of course. Weve been so long without challenges. I am sorry, Master Jaffa. I have revealed myself and failed. You must execute me for the remainder of the day."
0,51,9,HIBBARD,You must execute me as well.
0,51,9,ONEILL,Master Tealc. Might I suggest we ... spare them this time?
0,51,9,TEALC,"Very well ... underling. Captain, your full name and rank."
0,51,9,CARTER,Your *Earth* name?
0,51,9,TEALC (TO ROGERS),Your standing orders given to you by your previous Jaffa Master.
0,51,9,CAPTAIN/ROGERS,"To practise the exercises of battle according to the Rules of Engagement, until the return of our Lord Apophis!"
0,51,9,DANIEL,Really?
0,51,9,ROGERS,"When we are ready for the final challenge, he will come."
0,51,9,ONEILL,Dont hold your breath.
0,51,9,ROGERS,We *will* be ready.
0,51,9,CARTER,Youre training to serve Apophis wearing SG uniforms?
0,51,9,ROGERS,To know the enemy. Quadrant A is spared no detail. Weve studied long and hard and know much.
0,51,9,CARTER,About Earth.
0,51,9,ROGERS,Oh yes. Corn and cotton are indigenous to North America.
0,51,9,ONEILL,And that information could save your life one day.
0,51,9,ROGERS,"So you see, Master Tealc, my mistake will not happen again. I am ready to infiltrate the Tauri at your command."
0,51,9,TEALC,"That time has not yet come, Captain Rogers."
0,51,9,DANIEL (TO ROGERS),"So, if youre pretending to be ... who were those Jaffa attacking you?"
0,51,9,ROGERS,"They were led by my second-in-command, Captain Nelson, as part of the daily exercise. We have kept the Jaffa encampment separate so that we may better practise our Earth behaviour. Shall I have him sent for?"
0,51,9,DANIEL,"No, I dont think thatll be necessary."
0,51,9,TEALC (TO ROGERS),Send for him.
0,51,9,DANIEL,Yes! Send for him.
0,51,9,ROGERS,How else may I serve?
0,51,9,ONEILL,Wed like our weapons back. The ones we came with.
0,51,9,ROGERS,"They were stored in the Armoury Tent, at the conclusion of this mornings war game."
0,51,9,TEALC,Take us to them.
0,51,9,ROGERS,As you wish.
0,51,10,CARTER (TO JACK),"Colonel, none of them have symbiont pouches."
0,51,10,ONEILL,I noticed that.
0,51,10,TEALC,"Before Apophis requested asylum from the Tauri, there were but a handful of loyal Jaffa remaining in his service."
0,51,10,DANIEL,So he drafted ordinary humans?
0,51,10,TEALC,It is common practice among the Goauld to use humans as fodder during battle. Especially when facing defeat.
0,51,11,ONEILL (TO ROGERS),"Alright, Captain, we can handle it from here."
0,51,11,ROGERS,I can assist you.
0,51,11,TEALC (TO ROGERS),Shelkek.
0,51,11,ROGERS,"Yes, Master."
0,51,11,TEALC,"They are the code of battle during a young Jaffas training, spoken by Apophis himself."
0,51,11,TEALC,They are intar.
0,51,11,TEALC,Intar. They are used for training and only meant to stun. They can be identified by this crystal. They can take the form of any weapon.
0,51,11,CARTER,"Well, I got our GDOs, but my MP-5s still missing."
0,51,11,TEALC,As is my staff weapon.
0,51,11,ONEILL,"Alright, Tealc, I want everyone in one place, just to make sure. Can you handle that?"
0,51,11,TEALC,I can.
0,51,12,TEALC,Captain Rogers. Where are the weapons with which we arrived?
0,51,12,ROGERS,"They were returned to the Armoury Tent, of course."
0,51,12,TEALC,Do you possess a vocume?
0,51,12,ROGERS,"Yes, sir."
0,51,12,TEALC,Use it.
0,51,12,ROGERS,"Yes, Master Tealc."
0,51,12,ONEILL,What did you tell him to do?
0,51,12,TEALC,I instructed him to use a training instrument to assemble his men for inspection. It may serve to emphasise our authority.
0,51,14,CARTER,Sir?
0,51,14,ONEILL,"Just a huge honkin Apophis, Major. Nothing to worry about."
0,51,16,ROGERS (TO TEALC),"I would be honored if you would inspect my warriors, Master."
0,51,17,ROGERS,Company!
0,51,17,TEALC,Ready weapons for inspection.
0,51,17,TEALC,"You do yourself proud, Captain Rogers."
0,51,18,NELSON (TO TEALC),"Most of my warriors are engaged in the days battle, Master. I will relay your words to them after the battle."
0,51,18,ONEILL,Master Tealc ... if I may?
0,51,18,NELSON (CONFUSED),Sir?
0,51,18,ONEILL,"Its over, Nelson. Go tell your buddies to quit fighting."
0,51,19,NELSON (TO JACK),You speak more like a Tauri than a warrior of Apophis.
0,51,19,ONEILL,Thanks. Youre not so bad yourself. Who taught you?
0,51,19,NELSON,"If you are who you say you are, you already know the answer to that, sir."
0,51,19,ONEILL,"Nelson, I am *ordering* you to recall your men from the field."
0,51,19,NELSON,"Article 7, Section 3 clearly states that once the battle has commenced, it cannot be stopped."
0,51,19,ONEILL,Well youre obviously referring to the *old* Article 7.
0,51,20,CARTER,Thats it.
0,51,20,DANIEL,That means those kids are out there playing war games with real weapons.
0,51,20,ONEILL (OVER RADIO),"Go ahead, Carter."
0,51,20,CARTER,"So far, all weve recovered is one 9 millimeter and one MP-5."
0,51,21,TEALC (TO ROGERS),"I require all of Quadrant A to be assembled, including those engaged in the games. Immediately!"
0,51,21,ROGERS,"As Captain Nelson stated, Master ..."
0,51,21,TEALC (ANGRILY),Do you wish to be punished?
0,51,21,ROGERS,"Ill not fail your challenge a second time, Master Tealc."
0,51,22,ONEILL,Tell them the truth.
0,51,22,TEALC (TO THE BOYS),Warriors of Apophis. Hear me. Apophis has been slain in battle with his enemies.
0,51,23,ONEILL,Hey! Hes telling you the truth. The battle youve been preparing for is never gonna happen. Hes not coming back.
0,51,24,ONEILL (TO HIMSELF),Hello? Is this mike on? Were trying to tell you something important here!
0,51,24,ROGERS,"Apophis is a god. And gods cannot die. Therefore, Apophis cannot be dead."
0,51,24,NELSON,"And anyone who says otherwise is either testing us ... or is a traitor, sir."
0,51,24,ROGERS,"Now weve passed your challenge. If theres nothing else, sirs, were scheduled to join the games in progress. Company! Dismissed!"
0,51,25,TEALC (TO JACK),Apophis has lived for thousands of years. It is as if we have said the sun will never rise again.
0,51,25,ONEILL,It just might not for some of those kids if they dont wise up.
0,51,26,ONEILL,Whats going on?
0,51,26,HIBBARD,"Im *trying* to get a weapon, sir. Im already late, the games have started."
0,51,26,CARTER,"Colonel, one MP-5, Tealcs staff weapon and two 9 millimeters are still unaccounted for."
0,51,27,DANIEL,What does that mean?
0,51,27,HIBBARD,It means my team needs reinforcements.
0,51,27,ONEILL,"No, the game is cancelled."
0,51,27,HIBBARD,You cant do that!
0,51,27,ONEILL,I believe I can. Everybody grab an intar.
0,51,28,CARTER,"Its a staff weapon wound. Hes dead, sir."
0,51,29,ONEILL,Take cover!
0,51,29,ROGERS,Colonel! Ill draw his fire.
0,51,29,ONEILL,*Negative*! That is a *real* weapon.
0,51,29,ONEILL,I said stay down!
0,51,29,ONEILL,Secure that weapon!
0,51,29,CARTER,"Yes, sir!"
0,51,29,ROGERS (IN PAIN),Have I displeased Apophis?
0,51,29,DANIEL,No.
0,51,29,TEALC,Apophis would be proud.
0,51,29,ROGERS,This is the final challenge.
0,51,29,NELSON,What happened?
0,51,29,ROGERS,"The day has come, Nelson. The final challenge."
0,51,30,NELSON,Blood has been shed.
0,51,30,ROGERS,Prepare the men. The challenge must begin at first light.
0,51,30,NELSON,"Yes, sir."
0,51,30,ONEILL (TO TEALC),Whats he talking about? The final challenge?
0,51,30,TEALC,It is a day in a warriors training when first blood is shed. The games become real.
0,51,30,ONEILL,Oy.
0,51,31,CARTER,": Colonel? Weve found something. Our weapons were all turned back in after the war games, sir."
0,51,31,ONEILL,Roger that. Keep em secure.
0,51,32,ONEILL (TO DANIEL),Hows he doing?
0,51,32,NELSON,Apophis will save him.
0,51,32,DANIEL,"Well, actually, no. As a matter of fact, theres probably nothing more we can do for him as long as we stay here. Theres probably internal injuries."
0,51,32,ONEILL,So well take him back with us.
0,51,32,NELSON,You cannot.
0,51,32,ONEILL,For cryin out loud...
0,51,32,NELSON,"You know as well as I do that the rules forbid entry or exit of the sector before the final challenge, wounded or not."
0,51,32,ONEILL,"Right. Right, right."
0,51,32,ROGERS (IN PAIN),Apophis would be disappointed in me if ... if there were an exception made for myself.
0,51,32,DANIEL,"Well, what if I told you we were bringing you to see Apophis personally, to show him that blood has been shed and that your Quadrant is truly ready for his return? If we dont bring you back with us, then Apophis will know youve failed our challenge and never return."
0,51,32,ROGERS,Then I must go.
0,51,32,ONEILL,Good.
0,51,32,NELSON,Tell him we will make him proud.
0,51,32,ROGERS,I will.
0,51,33,ONEILL,We need a medical team!
0,51,33,HAMMOND,"What happened, Colonel?"
0,51,33,ROGERS (TO HAMMOND),My Lord?
0,51,33,ONEILL,"Actually, we just call him ... General Hammond."
0,51,33,ROGERS,Where is Apophis?
0,51,33,ONEILL,Hes not here. Sorry.
0,51,33,FRAISER,What have we got?
0,51,33,ROGERS,Liars! Traitors!
0,51,33,FRAISER,"Easy, easy!"
0,51,33,ROGERS (SHOUTING),You will be punished! He will avenge me!
0,51,33,FRAISER,": Who *is* this, sir?"
0,51,33,ONEILL,"His names Rogers. Despite appearances, hes not SGC."
0,51,34,HAMMOND (TO JACK),"Id like to debrief ASAP, Colonel."
0,51,34,ONEILL,"Yes, my Lord."
0,51,35,HAMMOND,Whats this final challenge all about?
0,51,35,TEALC,"In my training, it is when we received our actual staff weapons. The two opposing camps then engaged in battle until one side emerged victorious."
0,51,35,CARTER,You killed each other?!
0,51,35,TEALC,"The Goauld wish only the strong to prevail, Major Carter. I was among the victors. We were then honored by Apophis and I became a member of his personal guard."
0,51,35,HAMMOND,And thats whats about to happen to those boys.
0,51,35,ONEILL,"As long as they dont have real weapons with which to play, I dont see how."
0,51,35,CARTER,Well the only lethal weapons I found in the Armoury belonged to us. The rest were intars.
0,51,35,TEALC,"The Jaffa Masters who once supervised their war games have long ago abandoned them, yet they have maintained their games until this day without fail."
0,51,35,DANIEL,So what are you saying?
0,51,35,TEALC,That they are extremely resourceful and most determined.
0,51,35,CARTER,So they might try to fulfill the final challenge whether theyre issued lethal weapons or not.
0,51,35,TEALC,It is possible.
0,51,35,DANIEL,"Well lets face it, if they really wanted to kill each other they dont need guns to do it."
0,51,35,CARTER,": We have to go back there, sir, and try to prevent this from happening."
0,51,35,DANIEL,"General, were indirectly responsible for all this. They think that we were sent through to start this."
0,51,35,HAMMOND,I understand that.
0,51,35,ONEILL,What we need to send back there is a team of shrinks. Those kids are *out* there.
0,51,35,HAMMOND,"That may be so, Colonel, but before I send you or anyone else into a battle zone, I want to know whats going on on that planet."
0,51,35,ONEILL,Why dont I see what I can get out of Rogers?
0,51,35,HAMMOND,Very well.
0,51,36,FRAISER,"He wont eat, he wont speak ... except to call me a sholva."
0,51,36,ONEILL,You must be doing a good job.
0,51,36,FRAISER,"Theres no internal injury. He mustnt have taken the full force of the blast. Physically hell be fine. Emotionally ... thats another story. Hes very angry, Colonel."
0,51,36,ONEILL,Wheres his tray?
0,51,36,FRAISER,Over here. Good luck.
0,51,37,ONEILL,Ole Doc Fraiser says you havent been eating.
0,51,37,ROGERS,Its poison.
0,51,37,ONEILL,"Its hospital food, of *course* it is. Mmm, tuna."
0,51,37,ROGERS,Go to Sokar.
0,51,37,ONEILL,"Its Go to hell actually. Which, by the way, is a very rude thing to say to a person offering you a sandwich."
0,51,37,ROGERS,It means the same.
0,51,37,ONEILL,Youve got a point.
0,51,37,ROGERS,I will reveal nothing. You may begin torturing me.
0,51,37,ONEILL,"Oh, Ive already begun. This ... is the infamous tuna torture. Last chance. Good. So, you and I should have a little talk about this final challenge thing."
0,51,37,ROGERS,We will battle to the death and Apophis will choose the victors as his personal guard.
0,51,37,ONEILL,"Alright, Im going to tell you the absolute truth right now. Apophis is dead."
0,51,37,ROGERS (VEHEMENTLY),Gods cannot die!
0,51,37,ONEILL,Why do think hes been gone for so long? Why have all the Jaffa Masters left? Apophis was on his way out when you got drafted.
0,51,37,ROGERS,You lie.
0,51,37,ONEILL,What if he told you himself?
0,51,37,ROGERS,"If Apophis can speak, then he cannot be dead."
0,51,38,DANIEL,"When Apophis came to us, hed already been tortured."
0,51,38,ROGERS,Impossible. He is a god.
0,51,38,CARTER,The images were about to show you are of Apophis just before he died and his body was sent to Sokar.
0,51,38,ROGERS,Gods cannot die.
0,51,38,ONEILL,So you keep saying. Have a look.
0,51,38,ROGERS (HORRIFIED),What magic is this?
0,51,38,ONEILL,No magic. I was there.
0,51,38,TEALC,As was I.
0,51,38,TEALC,It is.
0,51,38,ROGERS,What will you do to us?
0,51,38,CARTER,Were not going to do anything to you. We wanna help you.
0,51,38,ONEILL,"You can go home, wherever that is. Wars over."
0,51,38,ROGERS,"No, its not. Because tomorrow the final challenge begins... and many of my men will die. For him."
0,51,39,HAMMOND,"Whats your real name, son?"
0,51,39,ROGERS,"My true name is Rafiatrey, sir."
0,51,39,ONEILL,"Your Earth names Kyle, can we call you Kyle?"
0,51,39,ROGERS,"That would be fine, sir, Im very used to that."
0,51,39,HAMMOND,How long have you been on that planet?
0,51,39,ROGERS,We were brought there through our chappaai five cycles ago from a number of different worlds.
0,51,39,CARTER,Right after we blew up Apophis ships.
0,51,39,ROGERS,He commanded that we worship no other god but him. He left many Jaffa warriors with us. They taught us everything.
0,51,39,HAMMOND,"Who taught you all about Earth, our uniforms, weapons?"
0,51,39,ROGERS,"Near the beginning, Apophis captured one of your SG teams and forced them to teach us."
0,51,39,SG-11.,
0,51,39,ROGERS,"Yes. At first that was all they would reveal. Our Jaffa Masters forced them to say things. We listened to your speech, observed your ways, but they did not last long."
0,51,39,HAMMOND,What happened to them?
0,51,39,ROGERS,"One day, their bodies were put on display in the encampment. I ... do not know how they died, only that they refused to tell the Jaffa Masters all that was asked of them. Then our Jaffa Masters began to leave us, one by one. They said, to help Apophis win a great battle. And then we were alone."
0,51,39,HAMMOND,"Thank you for your cooperation, son."
0,51,39,ROGERS,"May I now ask for your cooperation, sir?"
0,51,39,HAMMOND,Go on.
0,51,39,ROGERS,"As we speak, my men are preparing for the final challenge."
0,51,39,HAMMOND,I was under the impression your weapons are non-lethal.
0,51,39,ROGERS,"They are. But before Master Gartok left, he showed Captain Nelson and myself a cave. Inside were weapons intended for the final challenge. Real weapons."
0,51,39,ONEILL,What are we talking about here ... weapons-wise?
0,51,39,ROGERS,"They are exactly like your own. MP-5s. He told us it was with those that we would one day infiltrate the Tauri and destroy you. May I request permission to be returned to my men, sir, to tell them what Ive learned and to try and stop them?"
0,51,39,DANIEL,"They wont believe you, you know that."
0,51,39,ROGERS,They are under my command.
0,51,39,CARTER,"Tealc, is the vocume capable of recording other images?"
0,51,39,TEALC,"Yes, that is correct."
0,51,39,CARTER,"Well then Colonel ONeills already thought of the solution. I think you know where Im going with this, sir."
0,51,39,ONEILL,Havent a clue.
0,51,39,CARTER,Seeing Apophis die was enough to convince Kyle. All we have to do is show that same image to everyone else.
0,51,39,HAMMOND,With the vocume device?
0,51,39,CARTER,Yes.
0,51,39,TEALC,I believe ONeills solution could be successful.
0,51,39,HAMMOND,"In the middle of a battlefield, combining alien technology with our own?"
0,51,39,CARTER,"Sir, the technical part of transferring the data to the vocume I can figure out. Weve already been experimenting with interfacing Goauld technology with our own. The problem will be getting there."
0,51,39,ONEILL,"We do have the intars, General."
0,51,39,HAMMOND,What good will they do?
0,51,39,ONEILL,We could shoot first and ask questions later.
0,51,40,ROGERS (TO HAMMOND),May I request permission to join them? Sir.
0,51,41,ONEILL,"They *are* his men, General, and he might provide the tactical advantage we need to pull this off."
0,51,43,ONEILL,Final challenge scenario  lets hear it one more time.
0,51,43,ROGERS,"My elite SG squad is to defend the encampment from the invading force of other SG teams, led by Captain Nelson. The attackers are greater in number, but the defenders have greater firepower."
0,51,43,CARTER,But everyone on both sides will be in SG uniforms.
0,51,43,ROGERS,"As it would have been when we infiltrated Earth, yes."
0,51,43,ONEILL,"Good. You, stay with Carter, who will watch you like a hawk."
0,51,43,CARTER,"Yes, sir."
0,51,44,ONEILL,I told you to stay with Carter!
0,51,44,ROGERS,I was just trying to draw his fire.
0,51,44,ROGERS,"Yes, sir."
0,51,45,ROGERS,"Status report, Sergeant!"
0,51,45,SERGEANT,Captain Rogers?
0,51,45,ROGERS,I have just returned through the chappai with a message from Apophis. I have glorious news.
0,51,46,ONEILL (TO ROGERS),Get the vacuum.
0,51,46,ROGERS,Vocume.
0,51,46,ONEILL,"Whatever. Get it. Carter, set it up. Tealc, with Carter; Daniel, with me."
0,51,47,DANIEL,Here they come.
0,51,47,ONEILL,I got some at nine oclock here too.
0,51,49,TEALC,It is ready.
0,51,49,CARTER,Good. Im not. Give me a second.
0,51,50,),
0,51,50,CARTER,": Yes, sir!"
0,51,50,TEALC,What is the delay?
0,51,50,TEALC,ONeill!
0,51,50,ONEILL,Incoming! Rogers! What the hell was that?!
0,51,50,ROGERS,Mortars!
0,51,50,ONEILL,What else is in that cave?
0,51,50,ROGERS,"Stingers, M60s, M72s ..."
0,51,50,ONEILL,"Youre telling me this now?! What the hell?! Get down! Dammit, Carter!"
0,51,51,CARTER,Got it!
0,51,52,NELSON,Summoning his image during battle is against the Rules of Engagement.
0,51,52,ROGERS,Hear his words!
0,51,52,NELSON,When the challenge is over!
0,51,52,ONEILL,"Now, Nelson! You *will* listen to him *now*! Before anyone else gets hurt."
0,51,52,NELSON,"The final challenge is to the *death*, Colonel."
0,51,52,APOPHIS IMAGE,
0,51,52,NELSON (SHOCKED),He is a god. It cannot be so.
0,51,52,ROGERS,It is so.
0,51,52,NELSON (TO ROGERS),What will become of us? Where will we go now?
0,51,52,ROGERS,Home.
