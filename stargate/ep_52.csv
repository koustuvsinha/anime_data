0,52,0,"""FOREVER IN A DAY""","By Jonathan Glassner We open to a battlefield as SG-1 and several other SG units appear. There are several dead jaffas lying on the ground. There is a fenced in area with several people being held prisoner. Jack approaches the fence, placing a charge on the gate. The rest of SG-1 is standing guard."
0,52,0,JACK,Clear
0,52,1,JACK,Let's go folks..... come on.
0,52,1,KASUF,Good Son....you came.
0,52,1,DANIEL,"Yes Good Father, we got your message."
0,52,1,KASUF,She took the boy. They took him.
0,52,1,DANIEL,The boy?
0,52,1,KASUF,The son of my daughter. She took the boy.
0,52,1,JACK,"Come on Daniel, we gotta go"
0,52,1,DANIEL,You said she took him.
0,52,1,KASUF,There
0,52,1,DANIEL,Keep your people together. Go with the people of the Tauri.
0,52,1,JACK,Fall back.....Fall back
0,52,1,SAM,Daniel.
0,52,1,DANIEL,Sha're
0,52,2,JACK,Teal'c
0,52,3,DANIEL,Don't move Where's the boy?
0,52,3,AMAUNET/SHA'RE,Where you and the system lords will never find him.
0,52,3,DANIEL,Don't! Don't
0,52,4,DANIEL,No Sha're...fight it.
0,52,4,AMAUNET/SHA'RE,My host can not help you.
0,52,5,DANIEL,Sha're
0,52,8,DANIEL,What happened?
0,52,8,JACK,You don't remember?
0,52,8,DANIEL,I'm not sure.
0,52,8,SAM,We were on P8X-873. We were freeing the Abydonians whom the goa'uld had taken as slaves.
0,52,8,JACK,Kasuf sent for us.
0,52,8,DANIEL,Sha're was there.
0,52,8,SAM,Yeah...
0,52,8,JACK,She's dead Daniel. Sorry.
0,52,8,DANIEL,How?
0,52,8,TEAL'C,It was I who am responsible I was forced to fire upon and termanate the life of Sha're. However...I assure you it was done only to save your life.
0,52,8,DANIEL,No.
0,52,8,SAM,No?
0,52,8,DANIEL,No. They have a sarcophugus. Her guards put her in the sarcophagus. She's still out there somewhere. Alive. What?
0,52,8,GEN HAMMOND,"Dr., can he be taken out of the infirmary?"
0,52,8,DR. FRASIER,"We'll have to keep his drip in, but I'll arrange for a wheelchair."
0,52,8,JACK,"I'll take him, Sir."
0,52,8,TEAL'C,I will accompany you also.
0,52,9,DANIEL,Kasuf
0,52,9,KASUF,My son. It's a sad day for us all.
0,52,9,DANIEL,"No. I know this will be difficult for you to understand, Kasuf, but the demon inside your daughter will help her rise again."
0,52,9,KASUF,It this true?
0,52,9,JACK,Not this time...I'm sorry.
0,52,10,DANIEL,Why didn't you leave her there? They would have saved her.
0,52,10,JACK,There was no they left.
0,52,10,TEAL'C,"We were victorious, Daniel Jackson. There was no one remaining to take Sha're to a sarcophagus. We brought Kasuf to prepare her body according to Abydonian tradition."
0,52,11,JACK,The good news is we managed to save most of the Abydonians.
0,52,11,KASUF,And for that we are eternally grateful
0,52,12,DANIEL,You should have waited longer. I would have gotten through to her.
0,52,12,JACK,"She was trying to kill you, Daniel."
0,52,12,DANIEL,No she wasn't trying to kill me. Amaunet was trying to kill me.
0,52,12,TEAL'C,I have seen many humans killed by goa'uld ribbon devices. You would have been dead in mere seconds had I not acted.
0,52,12,JACK,"Teal'c did the right thing, Daniel."
0,52,12,TEAL'C,"I am sorry Sha're is dead. However, you are my friend. If I had to do it again, I would do the same."
0,52,14,SAM,Hi.
0,52,14,DANIEL,Hi.
0,52,15,SAM,I brought you some of those chocolate-walnut cookies you love so much.
0,52,15,DANIEL,Thank you. Have you ever really studied one of these?
0,52,16,SAM,A pen?
0,52,16,DANIEL,"I spent half my life studying the history of the written word, including how various cultures recorded things through the ages. From hammers and chisels to quills and ink. But I never stopped once to recognize the inginuity of this simple little peace of technology that we use. After the first team left me on Abydos, Sha're saw me writing in my journal and thought the ballpoint I was using was magic. A little device like this pen was such a wonder to her. The simplest thing was a wonder to her."
0,52,16,SAM,"Daniel, It's healthy to hold onto those memories."
0,52,16,DANIEL,I couldn't save her. All those wonders we have at our disposal and I couldn't save her. I'm just going to get some sleep if you don't mind.
0,52,16,SAM,Okay Um....let me know if you need anything. Okay.
0,52,16,DANIEL,Thank you.
0,52,16,SAM,Okay
0,52,17,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,Hear me Daniel
0,52,18,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,"Daniel, you're awake. He's awake."
0,52,18,DR. FRASIER,"Hey, how do you feel?"
0,52,18,DANIEL,Confused.
0,52,18,DR. FRASIER,I bet. Can you tell me your name?
0,52,18,DANIEL,Daniel Jackson
0,52,18,DR. FRASIER,And what's your birthday?
0,52,18,DANIEL,July 8th. Sha're.
0,52,18,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,Yes husband
0,52,18,DANIEL,You're alive.
0,52,18,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,I am
0,52,18,KASUF,As are most of our people. Thanks be to you. Thanks be to all of you.
0,52,18,DANIEL,What happened?
0,52,18,TEAL'C,I found you in the clutches of Amonet's ribbon device. I had no recourse but to fire upon her.
0,52,18,SAM,Then we took her straight to the Tok'ra. They had a captured sarcophagus and a way to remove the goa'uld.
0,52,18,DANIEL,Then I was dreaming before...
0,52,18,JACK,What?
0,52,19,DANIEL,Nothing.
0,52,19,JACK,umm....maybe we should.
0,52,19,SAM,"Glad to see you're ok, Daniel."
0,52,19,JACK,He's going to be ok?
0,52,19,DR. FRASIER,"Oh...it looks that way, Sir."
0,52,20,DANIEL,There's so many things I want to tell you. I don't know where to begin.
0,52,20,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,"Daniel, I only came to tell you about the boy."
0,52,20,DANIEL,What about him?
0,52,21,DR. FRASIER,"Daniel, Are you ok?"
0,52,21,DANIEL,No. Is Sha're here?
0,52,21,DR. FRASIER,No. Do...do you mean...we..we haven't taken her body back to Abydos. Is that what you mean?
0,52,22,GEN HAMMOND,Come in. Dr. Jackson. It's good to see you back on your feet.
0,52,22,DANIEL,"Yes, uh..Dr. Frasier just released me."
0,52,22,GEN HAMMOND,Is there something I can help you with Dr. Jackson?
0,52,22,DANIEL,"Yes, Sir. I've come to tender my resignation."
0,52,22,GEN HAMMOND,I won't accept it.
0,52,22,DANIEL,"I'm not military, sir, and it's a free country. Last I checked anyway."
0,52,22,GEN HAMMOND,You're obviously in an emotional state right now. You're making rash decisions. Why don't you take some personal time? Then see how you feel.
0,52,22,DANIEL,"That's not necessary, sir. I joined this program so that I could find my wife. I found her. End of story."
0,52,23,JACK,Hey! You should meet the whiz kid they saddled us with while you are out of commission.
0,52,23,DANIEL,Robert Rothman. He was my research assistant when I was doing my dissertation. Smart guy. He had a good teacher.
0,52,23,JACK,Geek.
0,52,23,DANIEL,"Yes, you used to call me that."
0,52,23,JACK,I was talking about you.
0,52,24,JACK,So...how long are we going to be stuck with this guy?
0,52,24,DANIEL,What do you mean?
0,52,24,JACK,How long are you gonna be gone?
0,52,24,DANIEL,Didn't Gen. Hammond tell you?
0,52,24,JACK,"What? That you quit? Yeah, he told me that, but, uh, come on. We both know you can't stay away."
0,52,24,DANIEL,"Then I guess we're both wrong, cause I'm gone."
0,52,24,JACK,Give it a week. You'll miss me.
0,52,24,DANIEL,"Yes, all the salty, bad-tempered insults, all the illogical arguments."
0,52,24,JACK,"Ok, you'll miss Carter and Teal'c."
0,52,24,DANIEL,I'll miss Carter.
0,52,24,JACK,"And you'll miss the excitement. All the new cultures you get to explore, the living history. That's the kind of stuff you can't walk away from."
0,52,24,DANIEL,"Jack, Up until now everytime I set foot through that gate I was thinking about my wife. Maybe I'll see her this time. Maybe this is the one. Now everytime I go through....it..it will be just some place where that hope used to be. That's why I can't do it anymore. I hope you understand that."
0,52,24,JACK,The SGC may be the single most important human endeavor for the future of mankind. Not bad huh? You said that.
0,52,24,DANIEL,The SGC will go on without me.
0,52,25,DANIEL,Please get out of my way Teal'c
0,52,25,TEAL'C,"I will, but you must hear me first."
0,52,25,DANIEL,I have a pretty good idea what you want to say.
0,52,25,TEAL'C,Is there not some form of human ritual in which I may ask your forgiveness?
0,52,25,DANIEL,No
0,52,27,DANIEL,Thank you
0,52,28,JACK,You're welcome
0,52,29,SAM,So....
0,52,29,DANIEL,so....
0,52,29,JACK,So.... Now what?
0,52,29,DANIEL,Now I get on with my life.
0,52,29,SAM,What are you going to do?
0,52,29,DANIEL,"Well, hopefully I'm going somewhere far away. To the most remote dig I can find."
0,52,29,SAM,Are we going to see you again?
0,52,29,DANIEL,At the funeral.
0,52,30,DANIEL,Now...if you'll excuse me. I seem to have a lot to do.
0,52,30,SAM,Ok....
0,52,30,JACK,Well...it's been a pleasure doing business with you. Dr. Jackson.
0,52,32,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,Hear me Daniel
0,52,33,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,Are you ill my husband?
0,52,33,DANIEL,Apparently
0,52,33,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,Go back to sleep. Tomorrow you will rise and return to your travels through the chaapa'ai.
0,52,33,DANIEL,"No, I won't. I don't need to anymore. I already found you."
0,52,33,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,You must continue....so you can find the boy.
0,52,33,DANIEL,Where is he?
0,52,33,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,"To continue your travels, you must first forgive Teal'c. He did what is right."
0,52,33,DANIEL,When he killed you?
0,52,33,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,Yes
0,52,33,DANIEL,But you're here.
0,52,33,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,"Yes, now go back to sleep. shhhh.... shhh.... Daniel rolls over on his side, closing his eyes. It's dark again....he opens his eyes rolling over. He's alone"
0,52,34,DANIEL,"I speak for Sha're who can no longer speak for herself. I have spoken no lies nor acted with deceit. I was once possessed by a demon who did these things against my will. The demon is gone and now I am without sin. Grant me a place in your blessed dwelling. If my heart weighs more than a feather my soul still contains sin. If not, may my soul join the gods. By the trial of the great scales, thy heart is light. Thy soul has been found true."
0,52,35,KASUF,Good Son.
0,52,35,DANIEL,"It was a beautiful ceremony, Good Father."
0,52,35,KASUF,It was. My heart is still burdened.
0,52,35,DANIEL,Why? Your daughter is with the god.
0,52,35,KASUF,"Yes, but you still have not heard her."
0,52,35,DANIEL,I don't understand?
0,52,35,KASUF,What she has to say is important ...to all of our future...Go to her.
0,52,36,DANIEL,Lesh Nol
0,52,37,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,Daniel You must forgive Teal'c.
0,52,37,DANIEL,"Yes, you already told me that."
0,52,37,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,And together you must find the boy.
0,52,37,DANIEL,Why?
0,52,37,KASUF,For he is Harcesis. The one who holds the secrets.
0,52,37,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,The boy is the son of two goa'uld hosts. He contains all the secrets of the goa'uld. You must find him.
0,52,37,DANIEL,How?
0,52,38,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,Hear me Daniel.
0,52,39,DANIEL,This is Dr. Daniel Jackson; I need to speak to Major Carter.
0,52,40,SAM,Daniel
0,52,40,JACK,"Well, ol doc Jackson. What are you doing here?"
0,52,40,DANIEL,I need to talk to Sam...alone.
0,52,40,JACK,"General, I need to talk to you...alone. They walk off."
0,52,40,DANIEL,How are they treating you Robert?
0,52,40,ROBERT,"Oh, uh well. I...I think they'd rather have you. Especially Colonel O'Neill."
0,52,40,DANIEL,Well...Don't let Jack get to you. He's...he's just intimidated by you. Because you...uh...you're way smarter than he is. Robert chuckles....
0,52,40,TEAL'C,It is good to see you well Daniel Jackson.
0,52,40,DANIEL,Teal'c...you did the right thing.
0,52,41,SAM,"So, what's up?"
0,52,41,DANIEL,How well do you understand the goa'uld hand device? How it works?
0,52,41,SAM,Well..uh..the best I can tell it uses a modified version of the power source for the staff weapon which it channels through amplification crystals that....
0,52,41,DANIEL,"No I meant, it works by thought control, right?"
0,52,41,SAM,"um...yeah, that's one way to put it. More like a thought control amplified by emotion."
0,52,41,DANIEL,"Ok, so there is a connection with the mind."
0,52,41,SAM,Oh Yeah...definitely.
0,52,41,DANIEL,So it's possible to send a thought ..through it if you had someone in one of those grips... like Sha're had me in?
0,52,41,SAM,"As far as I know, Daniel, it's designed to kill."
0,52,41,DANIEL,"Okay, but it could do both."
0,52,41,SAM,Yeah..I suppose it could. Why?
0,52,41,DANIEL,"I'm not sure. I know this may sound like wishful thinking, but I think Sha're was trying to send a message to me through the hand device."
0,52,41,SAM,What message?
0,52,41,DANIEL,I'm not sure.
0,52,42,JACK,"Hey, Daniel."
0,52,42,DANIEL,Hi...How'd you get in here?
0,52,42,JACK,"You left the base before we could catch you, we thought we would stop by and see you here."
0,52,42,DANIEL,How'd you get in here?
0,52,42,JACK,"Got sick of waiting in the hall, so I let us in. You...need a new lock... by the way."
0,52,42,KASUF,Good Son. It is important I speak with you.
0,52,42,DANIEL,"What is it, Good Father?"
0,52,42,KASUF,"Col. O'Neill tells me you are leaving his tribe, that you no longer intend to go through the chaapa'ai. Is this so?"
0,52,42,DANIEL,It is.
0,52,42,KASUF,"Well, this disturbs me greatly. It gives the people of Abydos great security knowing that you are out there among the gods. Protecting us."
0,52,42,DANIEL,"I'm sorry, Good Father. I joined the SGC in the hopes of finding Sha're. That goal is no longer obtainable. So I can not travel among the gods anymore. I hope you can understand that."
0,52,42,KASUF,"But, Daniel, my daughter wishes you to travel among the gods."
0,52,42,DANIEL,She does?
0,52,42,KASUF,Yes...so that you can find the boy.
0,52,42,DANIEL,"Forgive me Good Father, how do you know that?"
0,52,42,KASUF,"Sha're told me. Come, ask her yourself."
0,52,43,DANIEL,Sha're.
0,52,44,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,Come to me Daniel.
0,52,46,DANIEL,Am I interrupting?
0,52,46,TEAL'C,It is good to see you Daniel Jackson.
0,52,46,DANIEL,"Teal'c, what happens if two goa'uld hosts have a child?"
0,52,46,TEAL'C,It is strickly forbidden and punishable by death.
0,52,46,DANIEL,Really? Why?
0,52,46,TEAL'C,"If two hosts were to mate and produce a child, that child would contain all the knowledge of the goa'uld."
0,52,46,DANIEL,So the genetic memory that goa'uld have in their DNA is passed on to the human offspring?
0,52,46,TEAL'C,That is correct. Such children are called Harcesis. These children are hunted down and destroyed by the goa'uld with great impunity.
0,52,46,DANIEL,"So the offspring, the harcesis, would contain all the knowledge, all the secrets of the goa'uld that..."
0,52,46,TEAL'C,"Yes, Daniel"
0,52,46,TEAL'C,"Daniel Jackson, It pleases me greatly that once again you value my knowledge."
0,52,47,JACK,"General, the guys got two left feet. I'm telling you he slows down the unit."
0,52,47,DANIEL,Deja-Vu.
0,52,47,JACK,Deja-Vu
0,52,47,DANIEL,Deja-Vu. You know Rothman was a two-time decathlon champion in college.
0,52,47,JACK,Rothman?
0,52,47,GEN. HAMMOND,"Two left feet, huh?"
0,52,47,DANIEL,Trying to get Robert out of your unit?
0,52,47,JACK,"Well, yeah."
0,52,47,DANIEL,"Any chance of that happening, sir?"
0,52,47,GEN. HAMMOND,Only chance would be if you reconsider.
0,52,47,DANIEL,Okay.
0,52,47,JACK,"Good, so Rothman is gone...what?"
0,52,47,DANIEL,Okay.
0,52,47,JACK,Are you kidding?
0,52,47,DANIEL,"No, I've given it some thought and I've decided I'd like to come back."
0,52,47,JACK,May I ask what changed your mind? You were fairly adamant.
0,52,47,DANIEL,"I don't know, lets just say that there's something through the stargate that I think I still have to be the one to find."
0,52,47,JACK,"Now see, I miss that. I have no idea what he means, but I buy it. What do you say General?"
0,52,47,GEN. HAMMOND,"Haven't put through his resignation papers yet. Jack: Good, so he's in."
0,52,48,JACK,"So...Bruce Jenner. Sit this one out, huh?"
0,52,48,ROBERT,Uh....me? Why?
0,52,48,JACK,You've been reassigned to another unit.
0,52,48,ROBERT,Why?
0,52,48,JACK,"Okay, you're being replaced."
0,52,48,ROBERT,Why?
0,52,48,JACK,Because I'm intimidated by your intelligence. Where's the confusion here?
0,52,48,ROBERT,What?
0,52,49,SAM,Daniel
0,52,50,TEAL'C,"Daniel Jackson, you're rejoining SG-1."
0,52,50,DANIEL,Yeah.
0,52,50,JACK,...Thank You.
0,52,51,JACK,"Carter, grab your samples. Teal'c, stay with her. I'm going to check out that tree line. Daniel, the UAV didn't show any.... big signs of civilization, human, goa'uld or otherwise so.."
0,52,51,DANIEL,"So you want me to look for little signs of civilization, itsy- bitsy artifacts and...."
0,52,51,JACK,It's good to have you back.
0,52,52,JACK,Hey!
0,52,53,JACK,Where'd he go?
0,52,53,SAM,The address cleared before I got here.
0,52,54,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,You are finally here.
0,52,54,DANIEL,Yes.
0,52,54,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,"You are the only one who can save the boy, Daniel."
0,52,54,DANIEL,He's a harcesis. He contains all their knowledge.
0,52,54,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,"Amonet took the Abydonians as a show, so that Heru'ur would not know her true goal."
0,52,54,DANIEL,To take the boy.
0,52,54,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,She has sent him into hiding with her closest aide.
0,52,54,DANIEL,Where?
0,52,55,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,Kheb.
0,52,55,DANIEL,I know a Kheb. There...there's a reference in Budge. It's the mythical place where Osiris hid from Set. Kheb's a myth.
0,52,55,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,No.
0,52,55,DANIEL,Where is it?
0,52,55,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,Promise me you will save the child.
0,52,55,DANIEL,I promise.
0,52,56,SHA'RE/AMAUNET,I love you Daniel.
0,52,56,TEAL'C,I am sorry Daniel Jackson
0,52,56,DANIEL,"You did the right thing, Teal'c."
0,52,57,SAM,Oh god!
0,52,57,JACK,Teal'c?
0,52,57,TEAL'C,Daniel Jackson will be fine.
0,52,57,DANIEL,I love you too.
