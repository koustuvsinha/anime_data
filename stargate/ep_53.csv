0,53,0,O'NEILL,"""Anybody get the feeling these folks don't do a lot of travelling?"""
0,53,0,JACKSON,"""Well they might not even know what the 'gate is. I mean...ah, maybe it's some sort of artefact to them."""
0,53,0,CARTER,"""It's possible. I mean, you could stand here for months pressing symbols and still not find a combination that opens a wormhole."""

0,53,2,ORNER,"""Uh, me. Show me your papers."""
0,53,3,JACKSON,"""We don't have any papers. We're travellers, we've come to meet you."""
0,53,3,ORNER,"""Meet me?"""
0,53,3,WOMAN (WHISPERING),"""Not you."""
0,53,3,JACKSON,"""Actually, I meant your people. I'm Daniel, this is Major Carter and Jack O'Neill and Teal'c."""
0,53,3,ORNER,"""Who'd give you a name like Teal'c?"""
0,53,3,TEAL'C,"""It was given by my father. It means strength."""
0,53,3,WOMAN,"""You remember your father?"""
0,53,3,TEAL'C,"""For as long as I draw breath."""
0,53,3,ORNER,"""Then...you could not have been here at the time of the Vorlix."""
0,53,3,JACKSON,"""Vorlix...that doesn't ring a bell."""
0,53,3,WOMAN,"""It was the day that all we know of ourselves was taken away."""
0,53,3,ORNER,"""We can only remember the day since the Vorlix. Before that...nothing."""
0,53,4,CARTER,"""Well, I still don't detect anything out of the ordinary, Sir. And neither did the MALP. I think we're okay."""
0,53,4,O'NEILL,"""Well the MALP is worthless. You, I'll trust."""
0,53,4,ORNER,"""You needn't worry, friend. Ke'ra says that whatever it was that caused the Vorlix, came and went a year ago."""
0,53,4,WOMAN,"""At least a year. More."""
0,53,4,ORNER,"""In the first days after the Vorlix there was panic and confusion. It's hard to be exactly precise."""
0,53,4,O'NEILL,"""So you all just woke up one day and didn't know who you were. How does that work?"""
0,53,4,ORNER,"""My first memory after the Vorlix was of running in the streets, as though for my life. She was running right there beside me. Whoever she is."""
0,53,4,CARTER,"""Seems like some kind of mass amnesia, Sir."""
0,53,4,O'NEILL,"""Huh?"""
0,53,4,CARTER,"""It happened to a friend of mine during the Gulf War. Her chopper went down and she was knocked out. When she came to, her memories and identity before the crash were gone."""
0,53,4,O'NEILL,"""So, everybody on this planet took a hit to the head?"""
0,53,4,CARTER,"""Well, no, Sir. I'm not sure what could cause something like amnesia on this scale."""

0,53,4,WOMAN,"""The children are gone too."""
0,53,4,ORNER,"""If we ever had children."""
0,53,4,WOMAN,"""Well, we weren't grown on trees. We came from somewhere."""
0,53,4,ORNER,"""Then why have we photographs of the elders and none of the children, hmm? Answer me that. Daft. But if you do have any information we could use, you must seek Ke'ra."""
0,53,4,JACKSON,"""That's the second time you've mentioned that name."""
0,53,4,WOMAN,"""You don't know who Ke'ra is?"""
0,53,4,ORNER,"""She is Minister of Health, Science and Restructuring in the Vias Transitional Government."""

0,53,7,KE'RA,"""They will have to wait for the moment, Orner."" ""Does that help?"""
0,53,7,WOMAN2,"""No. I can't breath."""

0,53,7,CARTER,"""Well it looks like she's going into anaphylactic shock."""
0,53,8,KE'RA,"""Breath now. There. Better?"""
0,53,8,WOMAN2,"""Yes. Thank you."""
0,53,9,KE'RA,"""Rest here a while. Orner, you were about to introduce your friends."""
0,53,9,ORNER,"""They are travellers, Ke'ra, from far away."""
0,53,9,KE'RA,""" can see that."""
0,53,9,O'NEILL,"""Uh...O'Neill, Carter, Daniel and Teal'c."""
0,53,9,JACKSON,"""So, I'm guessing you were, or are, a doctor."""
0,53,9,KE'RA,"""It seems to be that before the Vorlix I helped others. That is all that I sense. Are you?"""
0,53,9,JACKSON,
0,53,9,KE'RA,"""Then you are a most welcome visitor here, Daniel."""
0,53,9,ORNER,"""They were not here at the time of the Vorlix."""
0,53,9,KE'RA,"""You've done absolutely the right thing in bringing them here, Orner. Thank you."" ""He fervently believes that we are husband and wife and that we need not wait until we regain our memories in order to renew our relationship. Perhaps you can help us. Please, follow me."""
0,53,10,KE'RA,"""This room has all the knowledge and research we've been able to recover since the Vorlix. I've spent every waking hour in here, reading, searching, dispensing whatever useful information I find. If you were able to help us, I know our people would be eternally grateful."""
0,53,10,O'NEILL,"""You seem to have everything under control."""
0,53,10,KE'RA,"""On the contrary, Sir, we're falling apart. Industry and agriculture on Vias has come to a halt. And when winter comes, it will be disastrous. Nothing less. You're not from Vias."""
0,53,10,O'NEILL,"""What gave us away?"""
0,53,10,KE'RA,"""Whatever agent that caused the Vorlix is gone, but its effects were pandemic. If you know who you are, then you cannot be of this world."""
0,53,10,O'NEILL,"""Oh. Well you know that big round ring thing you got stashed in a warehouse down the road?"""
0,53,10,KE'RA,":So, it is a transportation device."""
0,53,10,TEAL'C,"""So it is."""
0,53,10,CARTER,"""We call it a Stargate."""
0,53,10,KE'RA,"""Stargate...yes. Um, Dr Zervis mentioned that word in his research. Though I had given up hope of ever finding this Dr Zervis amongst our people, his papers have taught me much."" ""Here: ""Our visitor claims to have come to Vias from beyond the stars themselves. Though I still cannot comprehend the science behind this Stargate device she claims to have used."" I have studied this device since, but have been unable to activate it."""
0,53,10,JACKSON,"""Uh, Ke'ra, could you go back to the part about the visitor again?"""
0,53,10,KE'RA,"""She is mentioned many times in the archive."""
0,53,10,CARTER,"""What can you tell us about her?"""
0,53,10,KE'RA,"""That she was somewhat of an apothecary, and that she did not survive the Vorlix."""
0,53,10,O'NEILL,"""How do you know that?"""
0,53,10,KE'RA,"""The bodies of an elder woman and man were discovered some days later in a building destroyed by explosion. The only remains of our elders we have found. We deduced the male must have been Dr Zervis. And the female matches what little description he gave in his notes of the visitor."""
0,53,10,TEAL'C,"""What is the name of this elder woman?"""
0,53,12,FRAISER,"""Colonel?"""
0,53,12,O'NEILL,"""Oh hi, what's your name?"" Janet smiles."
0,53,12,TEAL'C,
0,53,12,O'NEILL,"""Possibly. I'd like to know what we're dealing with here."""
0,53,12,FRAISER,"""Sounds like a world-class case of amnesia."""
0,53,12,O'NEILL,"""Check these people out, will ya?"""
0,53,12,FRAISER,"""Yes, Sir. I'll find out what I can."" ""Let's, um, set up over here."""
0,53,13,JACKSON,
0,53,13,KE'RA,"""Yes, I found Dargol was a chemical once used as a pesticide. It seems to have had a significant impact on the environment, and has since been banned."""
0,53,13,JACKSON,"""Yes, we had a similar problem on my world with a chemical called DTT. It built up in the food chain until entire species were threatened."""
0,53,13,KE'RA,"""Yes. I first believed this Dargol was related to our loss of memory much the same way, but there's little evidence of it. I've found residue only in the bodies of those who have died since the Vorlix."""
0,53,14,JACKSON,"""What?"""
0,53,14,KE'RA,"""Sometimes the images of people in the archives look familiar to me. I wonder if I knew this person, or that person. There are still so many questions, like why are there no images of children and where have our elders gone? Through your Stargate perhaps?"""
0,53,14,JACKSON,"""Well, I suppose it's possible your people foresaw a disaster coming and sent the most helpless to safety."""
0,53,14,KE'RA,"""No, Daniel, whatever happened, happened quickly without warning."""
0,53,14,JACKSON,"""How do you know that? Because if you saw disaster coming, you would have left yourselves a note? Sort of a 'to whom it may concern..."""
0,53,15,CARTER,"""Sir?"""
0,53,15,O'NEILL,"""Oh...I was just thinking about amnesia. It doesn't quite track with Lynnea's nickname."""
0,53,15,TEAL'C,"""The Destroyer of Worlds."""
0,53,15,O'NEILL,"""Yeah, that one."""
0,53,15,CARTER,"""Well, actually, in sort of a sick way, it does. Ke'ra said herself their society was on the verge of collapse, despite their efforts. This world is in trouble, Sir."""
0,53,15,TEAL'C,"""Perhaps Lynnea was experimenting with other ways in which to destroy worlds."""
0,53,15,O'NEILL,"""Variety being the spice of life and all?"""
0,53,15,CARTER,"""The fact is, Sir, we let Lynnea out of Hadante prison. We gave her everything she needed to know about the network of Stargates to go anywhere she wanted."""
0,53,15,O'NEILL,
0,53,15,CARTER,"""We're responsible, Sir."""
0,53,16,KE'RA,"""Tell me of Lynnea."""
0,53,16,JACKSON,"""Well, uh, basically, we met her on a visit to another planet, during which we were imprisoned, unjustly, and Lynnea helped us escape."""
0,53,16,KE'RA,"""Surely there is nothing wrong with that, if you were imprisoned unjustly."""
0,53,16,JACKSON,"""Well, she was imprisoned justly. It was only after we escaped that we learned this nice, older lady we thought Lynnea was, was in fact a very, very bad, older lady, who had committed terrible crimes."""
0,53,16,KE'RA,"""What crimes?"""
0,53,16,JACKSON,"""She created a plague that almost wiped out an entire people. They called her the Destroyer of Worlds. She found your world because of us, through one of our computers. And that's why we're going to do everything in our power to help."""
0,53,16,KE'RA,
0,53,17,CARTER,
0,53,17,JACKSON,"""What?"""
0,53,17,CARTER,
0,53,18,FRAISER,"""Your diagnosis was bang on, Major. Now, Sir, I can either take the next several weeks setting up a lab here to study the problem, going back and forth for computer analysis. Or we could go back with these volunteers, do a series of MRIs and get the answers we need a lot faster."""
0,53,18,KE'RA,
0,53,18,FRAISER,"""As long as we maintain proper quarantine procedures, it shouldn't be a problem, Sir."""
0,53,18,O'NEILL,"""Alright, I'll go on back and brief Hammond."""
0,53,18,KE'RA,
0,53,18,FRAISER,"""I'm sure you can."""
0,53,20,CARTER (NODS),"""See you on the other side."""
0,53,22,JACKSON,"""You all right?"""
0,53,22,KE'RA,"""Incredible."""
0,53,22,ORNER,"""Am I in one piece?"""
0,53,22,WOMAN,"""Yes, Orner, one skinny little piece."""
0,53,22,JACKSON,"""General Hammond, this is Ke'ra."""
0,53,22,HAMMOND,"""It's a pleasure, Ke'ra."""
0,53,22,KE'RA,"""On behalf of the Transitional Government of Vias, we...thank you for your generosity and your support, General."""
0,53,22,O'NEILL,"""Daniel, you wanna show 'em to the Infirmary?"""
0,53,22,JACKSON,"""Right."""
0,53,22,KE'RA,"""Thank you."""
0,53,22,HAMMOND,"""Colonel, what if Dr Fraiser's unable to reverse whatever caused this?"""
0,53,22,O'NEILL,
0,53,23,FRAISER,"""Now if you look at the blue areas, you'll see that you all have the same identical obstructions in your temporal lobes and hippocampus sections of your brain. I'm not exactly sure what it is, except it's some sort of residue between the synapses. So it's possible your old memories are intact, they're just not accessible."""
0,53,23,JACKSON,"""So the memories are just blocked."""
0,53,23,FRAISER,"""Literally, yes."""
0,53,23,KE'RA,"""And does this material match the Dargol residue that I gave you?"""
0,53,23,FRAISER,"""We should be able to confirm that very quickly. And if it can be dissolved or removed without damaging the neurons..."""
0,53,23,WOMAN,"""Then we can be cured!"""
0,53,23,KE'RA,"""We need only to find the right medicine to dissolve the residue."""
0,53,23,FRAISER,"""That...that is much more difficult that it sounds."""
0,53,23,KE'RA,"""Well, then we should get started immediately."""
0,53,23,FRAISER,"""Uh, Ke'ra, we've already been at it for a long time and I still have some tests to run, so..."""
0,53,23,JACKSON,"""So, why don't I give you the fifty-cent tour?"""
0,53,23,FRAISER,"""Yes!"""
0,53,23,KE'RA,"""Thank you."""
0,53,23,FRAISER,"""Okay."""
0,53,24,KE'RA,"""Your complex is incredible, Daniel, your technology...I've never dreamed of such marvels. Thank you."""
0,53,24,JACKSON,"""You're welcome."""
0,53,24,KE'RA,"Is it, is it morning or night on the surface? Uh, may we see for ourselves?"
0,53,24,JACKSON,"""Uh, no, not yet. Soon, though, I hope."""
0,53,24,KE'RA,

0,53,25,KE'RA,"""Is my clothing unsuitable?"""
0,53,25,JACKSON,"""No, no, no. No, no it's...No it's uh, it's fine. I was just...Are you hungry? I can, I can have them send something down. You're hungry, I'm hungry, I'm gonna have them send something down. Are you...you want something?"""
0,53,25,KE'RA,"""Yes..."""
0,53,25,JACKSON,"""Right."""
0,53,25,KE'RA,"""Since the Vorlix, close contact has become...almost taboo. We were afraid that if we were ever able to regain our memories..."""

0,53,27,JACKSON,"""Right. I understand. That's...that's probably why I should do this."""
0,53,28,CARTER,"""Yes, Sir. I've been studying Lynnea's journals. Apparently, she found a link between Dargol - it's a chemical pesticide the Vians used - and longevity."""
0,53,28,O'NEILL,"""What's a bug spray have to do with longevity?"""
0,53,28,CARTER,"""Well, it seems it was having the effect of slowing the aging process. Not in an extreme way, but certainly significant enough."""

0,53,28,CARTER,"""Yes and no. They stopped using it over twenty years ago. It was adversely affecting their fertility rate."""
0,53,28,O'NEILL,"""So no kids."""
0,53,28,CARTER,"""Right. The point is: Lynnea was trying to enhance the life-extending properties of Dargol to create a sort of fountain of youth."""

0,53,28,CARTER,"""Uh...they're elders aren't missing, Sir. They are the elders. The fountain of youth worked. The amnesia was simply a side effect Lynnea didn't see coming."""
