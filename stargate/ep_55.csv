0,55,0,"""THE DEVIL YOU KNOW""",By Robert C. Cooper
0,55,0,HALLWAY JACK,So were talking about a rescue mission Marty: No one has ever escaped from Netu. No one except for Jolinar
0,55,0,BRIEFING ROOM SAM,Ive never had anything more than scattered flashes of her memories Marty: the Tokra have technology that aids the recall of memories
0,55,2,SAM,Shut it off! Shut it off!
0,55,2,JACK,Do it!
0,55,2,SAM,She was tortured... so badly
0,55,3,JACK,"Its her father, she knows the stakes"
0,55,3,MARTY,But if Samantha cannot recall...
0,55,3,JACK,Its been done before. It can be done again
0,55,4,MARTY,The atmosphere around the moon is impenetrable by ship. The only way to reach the surface is in the descent pods
0,55,5,JACK,Its certainly not Emerald City
0,55,5,CAVERN SAM,Weve come to see Bynarr. Jack gets hit by the blast from the hand device Bynarr: Who asks for me by name? Sam: I do! Bynarr: Throw them in the pit
0,55,5,THE PIT DAD,"Sam... Sam: Dad? Dad: Are you crazy? Jack: Uh, apparently Dad: Sokars fleet is ten times larger than we thought"
0,55,5,SOKARS PALACE SOKAR,Find out what they want... then kill them
0,55,5,THE PIT SAM,There are transportation rings in Bynarrs quarters
0,55,7,THE PIT JACK,We gotta go
0,55,7,CHRIS JUDGE,"And now, the conclusion"
0,55,9,JACK,You do understand were not too happy to see you?
0,55,9,APOPHIS,Your insolence is music to my ears. When I first saw you here I knew I had found the path out of damnation. You will be the means by which I reclaim the power and position that is rightfully mine
0,55,9,DANIEL,Your mate Amaunet is dead.
0,55,10,DANIEL,"Sorry to ruin your day. Actually, no, Im wrong about that. Im not sorry"
0,55,10,APOPHIS,Sokar sent word to me of Amaunets death. I did not believe it
0,55,10,DANIEL,"Well, believe it. Its true"
0,55,10,APOPHIS,Then it must also be true that Tealc is the murderer
0,55,10,JACK,"Oh, thats wrap things up real nice for you, wouldnt it?"
0,55,10,APOPHIS,Why is the sholva not with you?
0,55,11,OTHER GUY,This one conceals something
0,55,12,APOPHIS,"A communication device. Tealc, this is your god, Apophis. Risen from the fires of Netu. The fate of your friends will be pleasant compared to what I have planned for you. Return them to the pit. Kintac You will be my first prime"
0,55,12,KINTAC,It is my honour
0,55,12,APOPHIS,"Search them, and do whatever is necessary to ensure that they do not escape again. But do not kill them. When they are done serving us, I will have that pleasure for myself"
0,55,14,MARTY,I warned you when you sent Apophis through the Gate that he could be revived using a sarcophagus. Sokar would rather see his victims suffering than dead
0,55,14,JACK,He doesnt seem to be suffering much
0,55,15,SAM,Hes burning up
0,55,15,DANIEL,What is Apophis thinking? He cant hope to defend himself from Sokar
0,55,15,JACK,He seemed pretty confident to me
0,55,15,MARTY,"Apophis has one chance. He must convince Sokar not to kill him. If the reason is good enough, he may even be able to buy his freedom"
0,55,15,JACK,With us?
0,55,15,MARTY,"The information we hold. The secrets of Earth, and the Tokra"
0,55,19,SUPERVISING PRODUCER,Robert C. Cooper Producer: N John Smith Written by: Robert C. Cooper Directed by: Peter DeLuise
0,55,20,KINTAC,"Silence, dogs!"
0,55,21,KINTAC,Apophis speaks
0,55,24,APOPHIS,Bynarr is dead. Sokar will come.
0,55,25,APOPHIS,You fear he will bring his wrath down upon us. But he cannot make out existence any worse
0,55,25,DENIZEN,He could come in a ship and wipe us out from space!
0,55,25,APOPHIS,I can deliver us from this place. I have killed the Devils servant! I will destroy Sokar!
0,55,28,APOPHIS,Those that follow and serve me will be led to freedom...
0,55,29,APOPHIS,"...to a dominion! One in which the god Apophis, risen from the depths of the underworld will rule over all that was once shared by the Goauld"
0,55,30,JACK,"Well, this experience doesnt seem to have humbled him much"
0,55,30,APOPHIS,The dawn of our deliverance is upon us!
0,55,31,APOPHIS,Have no fear!
0,55,31,KINTAC,"Bow to Apophis, the deliverer!"
0,55,32,APOPHIS,Yes. Sokar will come
0,55,33,APOPHIS,I say let him come!
0,55,37,GUARD,"My lord, a cargo ship was spotted in orbit around Netu. Two gliders gave chase but the cargo ship entered hyperspace and escaped"
0,55,37,SOKAR,We must assume that the ship contained spies. The attack on the System Lords will begin sooner than planned. You will have the fleet ready in two days.
0,55,37,GUARD,"My lord, the very best we can do..."
0,55,38,GUARD,"The fleet will be ready, my lord"
0,55,41,APOPHIS,How many follow me?
0,55,41,KINTAC,Three hundred. The rest have been banished to the surface. They will change their minds or die
0,55,41,APOPHIS,Did you find anything when you searched the intruders?
0,55,42,KINTAC,Just this
0,55,43,KINTAC,"Even if all the Denizens decide to serve you, what good will it do? You cannot fight Sokar with crude weapons"
0,55,43,APOPHIS,Bynarr said he had one day to determine the identity of the intruders and report back
0,55,43,KINTAC,Then we have one day before Sokar sends his ship to destroy us
0,55,43,APOPHIS,Not if I have something he wants
0,55,43,KINTAC,You will discover the identity of the intruders
0,55,43,APOPHIS,I already know their identity. By the time Sokar arrives I will know much more. Bring me the woman
0,55,45,KINTAC,The woman will come with me
0,55,45,JACK,Umm... I dont think so
0,55,46,"OK, OK",
0,55,47,MARTY,The wound appears cauterised but there may be bleeding beneath the surface
0,55,47,JACK,Oh... God...
0,55,48,JACK,Easy!
0,55,49,JACK,"Oh, you...!"
0,55,52,APOPHIS,You used this device to access the memories Jolinar left in your mind. That is the only way you could have known how to escape. I will use it to get you to tell me everything I want to know.
0,55,52,SAM,It doesnt work that way.
0,55,52,APOPHIS,I know how it works. When it is fully activated it makes your memories easily accessible to your conscious mind.
0,55,56,SAM,I wont tell you anything
0,55,57,APOPHIS,The Blood of Sokar will cloud your mind
0,55,58,APOPHIS,Once under its spell you will tell me everything
0,55,59,DAD,Sam?
0,55,61,DAD,Are you almost ready?
0,55,64,DAD,Can we talk?
0,55,65,DAD,"Sam, you havent said two words since... since the accident. Your brothers made it pretty clear how he feels."
0,55,65,SAM,He blames you
0,55,65,DAD,I blame myself
0,55,65,SAM,your work has always been more important than us
0,55,65,DAD,You know thats not true. I dont want you to forgive me. I dont know if I could accept that yet. I just want you to understand
0,55,65,SAM,You were supposed to pick Mom up. You were late. She took a cab. There was an accident. I understand.
0,55,65,DAD,I couldnt have known it would happen
0,55,65,SAM,But Mom is dead
0,55,65,DAD,"Nothing I say or do can change that. All I can do is make sure the things she loved the most dont die with her. Sam, without you and your brother, my life is over. Nothing else means more to me. Dont forgive me. Just tell me that one day were gonna be OK."
0,55,68,SAM,He blames you
0,55,68,DAD,I blame myself
0,55,68,SAM,But Mom is dead
0,55,68,DAD,Just tell me that one day were gonna be OK
0,55,71,DAD,Just tell me that one day were gonna be OK
0,55,72,SAM,"No. I forgave you long ago. Why am I stuck in this? The same memory over and over. I guess if we never had this conversation neither one of us would be in this mess, would we? I would have gone on hating you and the military, I never would have got involved in the Stargate programme. You would have died of cancer"
0,55,72,DAD,"Sam, I am dying"
0,55,72,SAM,What?
0,55,72,DAD,Im dying right now... ... dying right now. Only you can save me Tell me how to get home
0,55,72,SAM,What?
0,55,72,DAD,"Tell me the way home, to Earth"
0,55,72,SAM,No. wait
0,55,73,SAM,This is not right
0,55,73,DAD,Youll lose me forever if you dont tell me the iris codes
0,55,73,SAM,This is not real
0,55,73,DAD,Tell me
0,55,74,APOPHIS,Tell me
0,55,75,APOPHIS,Tell me!
0,55,75,SAM,No!
0,55,75,APOPHIS,tell me how to penetrate the Earths Stargate. Tell me how... or I will kill your father
0,55,77,APOPHIS,"Tealc, this is your god, Apophis. Risen from the fires of Netu. The fates of your friends will be pleasant compared to what I have planned for you"
0,55,78,TEALC,It was then that I realised they would not be able to execute the escape plan. I entered hyperspace to avoid the gliders that had detected my presence
0,55,78,ALDWIN,You must have run the hyperspace engines at full power in order to make the journey so quickly
0,55,78,TEALC,The situation was urgent
0,55,78,ALDWIN,I understand your desire to report the information concerning Sokars planned attack against the System Lords as soon as possible. It may prove invaluable
0,55,78,TEALC,I have come seeking you assistance in order to rescue my friends and your fellow Tokra. I believe it to be only a matter of time before Sokar learns that Apophis has eliminated Bynarr and therefore takes action to restore control
0,55,78,ALDWIN,Wait here. I will consult the High Council and return shortly with a course of action
0,55,81,JACK,Ow! God...!
0,55,81,APOPHIS,Major Carter was most forthcoming
0,55,81,JACK,"She didnt tell you squat. Oh, and by the way, I wont either"
0,55,81,APOPHIS,You are not here to provide information. You are here for my amusement
0,55,82,JACK,"Oh! God, no! All right, all right, all right..."
0,55,85,JACK,Charlie!
0,55,87,APOPHIS,You must be dying to quench your thirst
0,55,90,SAM,Dad?
0,55,90,DANIEL,"Hes, uh... not so good, but hes still with us"
0,55,90,SAM,Apophis said he was gonna kill him
0,55,90,DANIEL,"No. He, uh... he brought you back and took Jack"
0,55,91,MARTY,Are you OK?
0,55,91,SAM,They gave me something called the Blood of Sokar
0,55,91,MARTY,It is legendary. A strong narcotic that can cause very realistic hallucinations. Im pretty sure I didnt give anything up
0,55,91,DAD,Sam?
0,55,92,SAM,Im here. Im here
0,55,92,DAD,"Sam, I hate to sound negative here"
0,55,92,SAM,Shh... Save your strength
0,55,92,DAD,I dont think Im gonna make it
0,55,92,SAM,No. That is unacceptable. Think about seeing your grandchildren again. Dont make me have to explain this to them
0,55,93,SAM,Martouf... If they come for you...
0,55,93,MARTY,I have endured torture before
0,55,93,SAM,"This is not like anything you could imagine. Everything seems real. Feelings, sensations. Its like youre actually there in your own past. And then suddenly everything seems wrong. Your mind gets all twisted. Just dont let Apophis use Jolinar against you"
0,55,93,MARTY,How could he?
0,55,93,SAM,You must be angry about what Jolinar had to do in order to escape from here. Martouf... she loved you.
0,55,95,JACK,Charlie! Sorry Im late. I stopped to get you somethin
0,55,96,JACK,You in there?
0,55,97,CHARLIE,Youre dead! Youre dead!
0,55,101,JACK,Whered you get that?
0,55,101,CHARLIE,Jeff Eisen gave it to me. Its just a water gun
0,55,102,JACK,It doesnt matter
0,55,102,CHARLIE,You have a gun
0,55,103,JACK,Thats different
0,55,103,CHARLIE,Why?
0,55,103,JACK,Charlie... Charlie!
0,55,104,JACK,Where you goin?
0,55,104,CHARLIE,Inside
0,55,104,JACK,"Well, wait a minute. I got you somethin. Come on, well play some catch"
0,55,104,CHARLIE,"This is not what happened, Dad. Youre changing everything just to make it better"
0,55,105,JACK,I know. Cant we just play catch?
0,55,105,CHARLIE,What really happened is that you got mad at me and I went into the house. Two weeks from now I shot myself with your gun your gun. We never played catch today and we never will
0,55,105,JACK,Why? Why cant we just play catch?
0,55,105,FLASH CHARLIE,Ill play... if you tell me... ... if you tell me
0,55,107,FLASHBACK JACK,What? What do you want to know? Ill tell you anything Hands Charlie the glove Charlie: Tell me how you made contact with the Asgard
0,55,108,JACK,"You cant know that. This isnt you Charlie: Sure it is. Come on, Dad. Well have a catch.Just like you want Jack: No. No."
0,55,111,ALDWIN,I have been instructed to return to Netu
0,55,111,TEALC,What is inside the container?
0,55,111,ALDWIN,A weapon
0,55,111,TEALC,For what purpose?
0,55,111,ALDWIN,The Tokra High Council believes that the uprising of Apophis presents a key opportunity
0,55,112,ALDWIN,Sokar will take his mother ship into orbit around Netu to restore order there
0,55,112,TEALC,This weapon is intended for Sokar
0,55,112,ALDWIN,"Yes, but unfortunately we have no weapons capable of penetrating the shields of a Goauld mothership"
0,55,112,TEALC,How then will this weapon prove effective?
0,55,112,ALDWIN,"I aim to launch it through the atmosphere of the moon into one of the holes of its surface and down into the core. There it will force the base elements into a cataclysmic chain reaction. The entire moon will explode, taking Sokars ship with it"
0,55,112,TEALC,Along with everything else on that moon
0,55,112,ALDWIN,The Tokra would not do such a thing unless there was no other alternative. Sokar cannot be permitted to rise to a dominant power. It would end our chances of ever overthrowing the Goa'uld
0,55,112,TEALC,What of rescuing my friends and the Tokra still trapped on that world?
0,55,112,ALDWIN,"I am charged with my mission. If you intend to stand in my way, I will insist that you remain here on Vorash"
0,55,112,TEALC,I will accompany you
0,55,112,ALDWIN,Then we must leave immediately
0,55,114,DANIEL,Jack?
0,55,114,JACK,No... I dont wanna go to school
0,55,115,JACK,Ow...
0,55,115,DANIEL,You OK?
0,55,115,JACK,No
0,55,115,DANIEL,"They, uh... they took Martouf"
0,55,115,JACK,They put that damn memory thing on me. And then they gave me something... that reminded me of the 70s
0,55,115,DANIEL,The Blood of Sokar
0,55,115,JACK,Daniel...
0,55,115,DANIEL,Yeah?
0,55,115,JACK,Im gonna pass out again
0,55,118,TEALC,"If Sokar has not entered orbit around Netu when we arrive, a rescue could still be attempted"
0,55,118,ALDWIN,"Yes. But if he is already in orbit, we must act swiftly and launch the weapon. I dont like this any more than you do. But essentially, this is war. If Sokar ascends to ultimate power the consequences will be far greater than losing a few good people"
0,55,118,TEALC,I understand
0,55,118,ALDWIN,Timing will be critical. Once the weapon has been launched it will take approximately twelve minutes for the reaction in the moons core to reach critical mass. If Sokar has enough advanced warning he will have time to escape the range of the explosion
0,55,120,MARTY,"No, please"
0,55,121,APOPHIS,Jolinar was your mate
0,55,122,APOPHIS,Tell me the location of the Tokra resistance or she dies
0,55,122,SAM,"Dont do it, Martouf"
0,55,122,APOPHIS,Silence
0,55,123,MARTY,Please...
0,55,123,APOPHIS,Tell me now
0,55,123,ROSHA,Im not Jolinar. Dont tell him anything
0,55,124,APOPHIS,Tell me
0,55,124,MARTY,I cannot let him kill you
0,55,124,ROSHA,"No, Martouf. No, Martouf"
0,55,125,MARTY,Entac
0,55,126,MARTY,The Tokra resistance is based on the planet Entac
0,55,127,APOPHIS,Return them to the pit. Bring me Daniel Jackson
0,55,130,SOKAR,Speak
0,55,130,GUARD,"Your fleet is ready, my lord"
0,55,130,SOKAR,You have done well
0,55,130,GUARD,Bynarr has not yet reported as you wished
0,55,130,SOKAR,"I will take my ship, and cleanse the underworld so that its fires may be reborn. Then I will launch the attack on the System Lords. Soon the entire realm of the Goauld will serve me... or suffer the fate of the damned"
0,55,134,MARTY,I knew it was you
0,55,134,SAM,"You shouldnt have done it, Martouf"
0,55,134,MARTY,"I could not watch him kill you, Samantha"
0,55,134,SAM,You lied
0,55,134,MARTY,Entac is a primitive planet. There are no Tokra there
0,55,134,SAM,You were very convincing. I believed you
0,55,134,MARTY,"If Apophis believes he knows the location of the Tokra, what does he want from Dr Jackson?"
0,55,136,SOKAR,"Hear me, Bynarr. Why do you defy your lord, Sokar?"
0,55,137,APOPHIS,"Bynarr is dead by my hand. I am Apophis, and the Denizens of Netu follow me"
0,55,138,SOKAR,I will bring the full force of my weapons down upon you. You will die in burning hell fire
0,55,138,APOPHIS,First you will hear me
0,55,140,ALDWIN,We must hold our position in the shadow of the moon so we are not detected
0,55,142,APOPHIS,"Before you fire upon us, know this: I have tortured the intruders. Three from the Tauri and a Tokra. I have learnt much, including the location of the Tokra resistance. Bynarr was weak. He was incompetent. A Goauld of your superior power deserves more. I wish to serve you. I offer this information I have gathered as proof. Grant me an audience and allow me to show my reverence to you by bowing at your feet"
0,55,142,SOKAR,I will grant you this request
0,55,142,APOPHIS,I am forever in your service
0,55,143,APOPHIS,Take him away
0,55,144,KINTAC,Be quick!
0,55,145,APOPHIS,Sokar will die by my hand and I will command his domain
0,55,145,KINTAC,Surely he will not let you enter his ship with weapons
0,55,146,APOPHIS,"Do you think I am a fool? I have been planning this since the moment I was sent here. I will convince Sokar to make me the new lord of Netu. He will come down off his throne to brand me with his seal, and when he gets close enough..."
0,55,147,APOPHIS,"On my command, replace this... here"
0,55,150,TEALC,Someone has transported from the surface of Netu to Sokars vessel
0,55,151,ALDWIN,The weapon is ready for launch. Sokars ship is almost in position
0,55,153,DANIEL,Sokars ship is in orbit. Apophis went up to meet him. I managed to get this
0,55,154,JACK,Nice
0,55,154,SAM,Can Sokars ship pick up the transmission?
0,55,154,MARTY,The signal is coded
0,55,157,SAM,"Tealc, can you hear me?"
0,55,157,TEALC,"Wait! Major Carter, it is I"
0,55,157,SAM,Thank God
0,55,158,TEALC,Wait!
0,55,165,JACK,What the hell is that?
0,55,165,MAN,Sokar is attacking!
0,55,166,SAM,"Tealc, whats going on?"
0,55,168,TEALC,You have twelve minutes until Netu is destroyed
0,55,168,SAM,What? Why?
0,55,168,TEALC,"I am here with the Tokra Aldwin. He has launched a weapon into the moons core which will explode, destroying Sokars ship which is in its orbit"
0,55,169,MARTY,"The Tokra High Council must believe it is the only choice, otherwise they would not sacrifice us in this way"
0,55,169,JACK,Were not dead yet
0,55,170,SAM,I have an idea
0,55,171,SAM,Help me pack this. Fill in this vent. As many rocks as you can. Wedge them in real tight.
0,55,174,APOPHIS,"My time of suffering has taught me the strength of your power, my lord"
0,55,174,SOKAR,Tell me the information you extracted from the intruders
0,55,174,APOPHIS,I beg you to grant me the privilege of ruling Netu. Bynarr was not worthy of such honour
0,55,174,SOKAR,Tell me the location of the Tokra rebellion
0,55,174,APOPHIS,That is only one of the many valuable things I have learnt
0,55,175,SOKAR,"Why do you try my patience? Tell me, and I will grant you your wish and brand you Lord of the Underworld"
0,55,175,APOPHIS,The Tokra are based on the planet Entac
0,55,176,APOPHIS,What is the meaning of this?
0,55,176,SOKAR,I recently conquered Entac. There are no Tokra there. Kill him. Slowly.
0,55,177,ALDWIN,"We have less than nine minutes. If we stay here much longer, we risk being caught in the explosion ourselves"
0,55,177,TEALC,I will take that risk
0,55,177,ALDWIN,"Even if Martouf and your friends somehow make it to the transporter rings on Netu, Sokars ship is in the direct path of the matter stream"
0,55,178,ALDWIN,There is no way we can intercept them
0,55,179,ALDWIN,"Tealc, unhand me! Tealc!"
0,55,180,ALDWIN,"Tealc, this is suicide"
0,55,181,ALDWIN,Tealc!
0,55,184,SAM,Go!
0,55,189,DANIEL,Were on our way
0,55,190,TEALC,"Timing is critical, Daniel Jackson. You must tell me precisely when you are ready"
0,55,193,ALDWIN,"Tealc, listen carefully! In order to intercept the matter stream you must fly the cargo ship between Sokars ship and the planet. If we do not come to a complete stop we could miss part of the matter stream. Your friends would die. And thats only if Sokar doesnt blow us out of the sky"
0,55,195,JACK,get in position!
0,55,195,DANIEL,"Almost there, Tealc"
0,55,197,GUARD,"Forgive me! The hellfires of Netu are erupting, my lord"
0,55,197,SOKAR,What?
0,55,197,GUARD,The ships sensors indicate that the moons core ahs become unstable
