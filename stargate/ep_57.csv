0,57,0,"""PRETENSE""",By Kathryn Powers Entering seeing a death glider trying to escape firing from a mother ship. The mother ship explodes and the glider starts coming down to the planet damaged. Hard landing.
0,57,1,SKARRA,"Please, help me!"
0,57,3,TECHNICIAN,"Still no incoming signal, Sir."
0,57,3,HAMMOND,All units are Earth site.
0,57,4,DANIEL,Is it my eyes or does the iris look a little...
0,57,4,SAM,It's loosing integrity.
0,57,5,SAM,Hold fire!
0,57,6,SAM,It's Schrodinger. The cat I gave to the Tollan Narim.
0,57,6,JACK,Cat.
0,57,6,TEAL'C,The Tollan possesses technology to walk through solid matter.
0,57,6,JACK,A technology that if you all recall they refuse to share... with us.
0,57,7,NARIM,General Hammond I am unfamiliar with Earth protocol in these matters. I sent Schrodinger so you would know a friend was coming.
0,57,7,HAMMOND,"It's all right, Narim. The Tollan are welcome here. Units stand down."
0,57,8,NARIM,Samantha. It's good to see you again.
0,57,8,SAM,It's good to see you too.
0,57,8,HAMMOND,What can we do for you Narim?
0,57,8,NARIM,I am here to deliver a message from our highest governing body. Colonel O'Neill. The Tollan Curia requests the presence of you and your team for Triad.
0,57,9,JACK,I feel like I'm being served.
0,57,11,JACK,So what exactly is this Triad?
0,57,11,NARIM,It is an ancient ceremony of justice. Quite honorable.
0,57,11,DANIEL,So it's kinda like a tri-al.
0,57,11,NARIM,I am not familiar with trial.
0,57,11,DANIEL,Trial. It's kinda like a tribunal. A place where matters of justice and law are decided.
0,57,11,NARIM,Then yes. A Triad is similar to you trial.
0,57,11,JACK,"So, who's on trial?"
0,57,11,DANIEL,ad.
0,57,11,JACK,Triad...al?
0,57,11,NARIM,The decision that the triad must decide is of a great concern to an old friend of yours. An Abydoian by the name of Skarra.
0,57,11,DANIEL,What?
0,57,11,NARIM,It is he who has requested your presence.
0,57,11,DANIEL,"He's alive, he's okay?"
0,57,11,NARIM,He is well. But he does need your help for Triad.
0,57,11,JACK,Where's this taking place?
0,57,11,NARIM,"Our destination is the new home world, Tollana."
0,57,11,SAM,But we sent you to the Now planet. There wasn't a gate on Tollana.
0,57,11,NARIM,The Nox and the Tollan devised a way to get us there.
0,57,11,JACK,Of course you were.
0,57,11,DANIEL,Way smarter then we are...
0,57,13,JACK,Very nice.
0,57,13,SAM,"So, you built that... Stargate?"
0,57,13,NARIM,Yes.
0,57,13,DANIEL,Way smarter then we are...
0,57,14,JACK,Our is bigger...
0,57,15,DANIEL,What just happened?
0,57,15,NARIM,Your weapons have been disabled.
0,57,15,JACK,What?
0,57,16,NARIM,Do not worry. You may continue to carry them if you wish.
0,57,16,JACK,You didn't think you should've told us about this before we came?
0,57,16,NARIM,I didn't find it relevant.
0,57,16,JACK,We don't travel to other planets without weapons with which to defend ourselves.
0,57,16,NARIM,May I ask what you intend to defend yourselves against? The Tollan have never threatened you. In any way.
0,57,16,TEAL'C,He is correct O'Neill. I do not feel the need to carry a weapon in this place.
0,57,16,SAM,"And Sir, judging on what I've seen in the last five minutes, our... weapons wouldn't be much of a match to their technology anyway."
0,57,16,NARIM,No harm will come to you. The Tollan will guarantee it.
0,57,16,JACK,Is that a money-back-if-your-not-completely-alive guarantee?
0,57,17,NARIM,This way.
0,57,19,TRAVELL,These must be our visitors from Earth. Welcome.
0,57,19,NARIM,"High Chancellor Travell, this is Colonel Jack O'Neill."
0,57,19,JACK,Hi.
0,57,19,NARIM,"Doctor Daniel Jackson, Major Samantha Carter."
0,57,19,SAM,Hello.
0,57,19,NARIM,And Teal'c.
0,57,19,TRAVELL,We are honored that you have agreed to participate in Triad. Your seeker will decide which one of you will be archon.
0,57,19,JACK,Seeker? Archon? Daniel?
0,57,19,DANIEL,Uhh... With respect High Chancellor; Narim didn't really explain the Triad very well. Could you please define those terms for us?
0,57,19,TRAVELL,"In Triad there are two arguing parties called Seekers. Triadic law requires that there be one archon who is sympathetic for each cause, and one neutral archon. The archons argue the dispute until a decision is reached."
0,57,19,DANIEL,So the seeker is the defendant and the archon is the attorney.
0,57,19,JACK,I got it. So Skarra is our...
0,57,19,DANIEL,Seeker.
0,57,19,JACK,Seeker.
0,57,19,TRAVELL,Narim will take you to him now.
0,57,19,NARIM,This way.
0,57,20,SAM,Skarra?
0,57,21,KLOREL,You... You will pay for what you did to my father.
0,57,21,JACK,It's good to see you too.
0,57,22,SKARRA,I am very happy to see you. All of you.
0,57,22,JACK,What's the deal? What just happened?
0,57,22,NARIM,"The Tollan designed the device worn about his chest. It suppresses the Goa'uld's ability to silence his host. The Goa'uld and host are free to speak at will. The device cannot be removed as long as Klorel and Skarra are our guests. The indicator on the front prevents one from pretending being the other. Red indicates it is Klorel who speaks. Blue, Skarra."
0,57,22,JACK,Nice device. We'll take a dozen.
0,57,22,NARIM,"As you may recall from our last encounter, it is forbidden for the Tollan to give our technology to any culture less advanced then our own."
0,57,22,JACK,Still got that arrogance bug I see.
0,57,22,SKARRA,It is I O'Neer. Are you not happy to see me?
0,57,23,JACK,Yeah. It's good to see you.
0,57,23,SKARRA,"I knew you would come. With your help, I will be free of this demon. Every day I fight him. I listen. I learn."
0,57,23,NARIM,It is time for Skarra to choose his archon.
0,57,23,SKARRA,O'Neer is strong. Danyer is wise. May I not choose both?
0,57,23,NARIM,"You may. They may both argue. However, they will have but one vote."
0,57,23,DANIEL,"Okay, what is this Triad about? What's to be decided?"
0,57,23,NARIM,Two days ago a small Goa'uld vessel crashed in a remote area. The occupant was badly injured. It was Skarra.
0,57,23,SKARRA,We were fleeing a battle group dispatched by Heru'ur. My demon knew that Tollans would stop them.
0,57,23,NARIM,Which we did. We warned them. But they came anyway. Our defense gird was forces to destroy them.
0,57,23,SAM,"So, Heru'ur is dead?"
0,57,23,SKARRA,"No, but two of his mother ships were destroyed."
0,57,23,JACK,"Wait a minute, you blew away two Goa'uld mother ships?"
0,57,23,NARIM,We are not a warring people but our defense technology is far greater then that of the Goa'uld.
0,57,23,DANIEL,"Yeah, I know that all this weapons chatter gets my blood pumping but could we get back to the Triad?"
0,57,23,NARIM,"Yes, of course. When our sentries reached the crashed vessel Skarra asked that we free him of his Goa'uld. But the Goa'uld refuses. Therefore under Tollan law we have no choice but to hear both parties before acting."
0,57,23,JACK,And Klorel's...
0,57,23,DANIEL,Archon.
0,57,23,JACK,Archon... Is who?
0,57,25,TRAVELL,"My Lord Zipacna, we are honored that you have agreed to participate in Triad."
0,57,25,KLOREL,We would speak in private.
0,57,25,TRAVELL,As you wish.
0,57,26,JACK,"So, when you were trying to get us to come here and `disarm' us, you didn't feel it appropriate to mention that a freakin' Goa'uld was going to be here? Not to mention his associates?"
0,57,26,TRAVELL,They are as unarmed as you.
0,57,26,JACK,You sure of that?
0,57,26,NARIM,Our technology detects and disables any form of weaponry.
0,57,26,JACK,Uh-huh.
0,57,26,DANIEL,You said that there was a third neutral archon... That's a... Tollan?
0,57,26,TRAVELL,No. We have asked our friends to send someone capable of remaining neutral. I believe you have met.
0,57,27,DANIEL,Lya.
0,57,27,LYA,It is good to see you once again friends.
0,57,28,JACK,"Well, this just became a piece of cake, a walk in the park, a day at the beach."
0,57,28,DANIEL,An accident waiting for a place to happen?
0,57,28,JACK,Mister Negative.
0,57,29,SAM,"Sir, what makes you so confident?"
0,57,29,JACK,"Because Lya is a fair and insightful person who will vote our way. Besides, she likes us."
0,57,29,DANIEL,Lya likes everyone. It's the Nox way.
0,57,30,JACK,"So, what do we have on this fine Goa'uld fella?"
0,57,30,TEAL'C,Zipacna was once of Apophis' most loyal underlords.
0,57,30,JACK,"Well, I don't believe for one second he's come to talk Klorel's way out of here."
0,57,31,NARIM,They are ready for you.
0,57,31,JACK,"Thank you. Carter, you and Teal'c keep an eye on Zippy's kids"
0,57,31,SAM,Yes Sir.
0,57,31,JACK,See what they're up to.
0,57,34,TRAVELL,"This dispute involves two sentient being who inhabit the same body. Both have requested sole use of the body, therefore we must establish the right of priority over the body to whom does it belong."
0,57,34,JACK,Ostensibly the one to whom it was born!
0,57,34,ZIPPY,"Your Eminence, I must request that the human contingent follow decorum appropriate to such an auspicious body as this one."
0,57,34,TRAVELL,I agree. The archons will refrain from questions or comments until their side is acknowledge. At this time I recognize Lord Zipacna and Klorel.
0,57,34,ZIPPY,"Until three years ago, the humans on Abydos live under Goa'uld law. Administrated by Ra. Now by that law, they were Goa'uld property. Lord Klorel merely took what was already his."
0,57,34,JACK,By force!
0,57,34,TRAVELL,Colonel O'Neill please.
0,57,34,JACK,"Sorry, sorry."
0,57,34,TRAVELL,I understand your desire to defend your position Colonel. And I will give you that opportunity. I would first like to hear Skarra's prospective.
0,57,35,SKARRA,"I was born to this body. Free of the demon Klorel. He stole my body. On Abydos, I would have married, had children, grown old, and died. But the Goa'uld took more then my body. He stole my life."
0,57,35,TRAVELL,Human archons.
0,57,35,DANIEL,"Skarra, when you were born, did your people believe they were slaves?"
0,57,35,SKARRA,No.
0,57,35,DANIEL,"Just so we can all be clear, who was Ra?"
0,57,35,SKARRA,We believed him to be an evil god.
0,57,35,DANIEL,So he enslaved your people through superstition and fear?
0,57,35,SKARRA,"Until you came, yes."
0,57,38,ZIPPY,"Tell me, did the people of Abydos hunt?"
0,57,38,SKARRA,Yes.
0,57,38,ZIPPY,"Did you also use animals as beast of burden for food, for clothing?"
0,57,38,SKARRA,Yes...
0,57,38,ZIPPY,Do you also eat the flesh of humans?
0,57,38,SKARRA,No! Never!
0,57,38,ZIPPY,Then you make judgment that animals have a lesser value then humans.
0,57,38,SKARRA,We care for our animals. We worship them. We thank them for the gifts they give us.
0,57,38,ZIPPY,"Yes, but you keep them to do your will. And you kill them to survive."
0,57,38,SKARRA,When we have the need.
0,57,38,ZIPPY,"As we do with humans. When we have the need. If a human has the right to take an animal's body as he pleases because he is a superior being, so does a Goa'uld. And by that argument alone, the Goa'uld has priority. And the host belongs to Klorel."
0,57,38,TRAVELL,Do the human archons wish to respond?
0,57,38,JACK,Yes ma'am you betcha.
0,57,38,DANIEL,We do your Eminence.
0,57,38,JACK,Can I go first?
0,57,39,JACK,Your argument is flawed in oh so many ways. Humans are self-aware. Animals aren't.
0,57,39,ZIPPY,"Animals are not, because you deem them not to be. Just as we deem humans, not to be."
0,57,39,DANIEL,What my learner colleague means is that humans have a more advanced intelligence then that of lower cast animals.
0,57,39,JACK,Exactly. Just like that.
0,57,39,ZIPPY,Is that not a matter of perspective? Just as a human would consider itself more intelligent then a pig. Or a pig would consider it more intelligent then a... rat.
0,57,39,JACK,Speaking of rats... what's your point?
0,57,39,ZIPPY,"My point is the Goa'uld considers itself more intelligent then humans. Our technology is more advanced then your, our mere knowledge of the universe is more advanced then yours."
0,57,39,JACK,You stole that knowledge!
0,57,39,DANIEL,"You took human knowledge when you took humans as hosts. Just as you took knowledge from other species. The Stargate isn't your technology. You just, took that. As far as we known, nothing you have... came from you. So clearly the evidence isn't that you more intelligent just... more parasitic."
0,57,39,ZIPPY,The method of gaining the knowledge is not the question. We were able to obtain it. You were not.
0,57,39,JACK,"Oh, please..."
0,57,39,TRAVELL,Gentlemen. We seem to have wondered away form that central topic. Which seeker has priority over this body?
0,57,39,DANIEL,If I may you Eminence I don't think we've wondered away from the central topic at all. What we're trying to point out is that the Goa'uld steal all they possess. As they have in fact stolen Skarra's body.
0,57,39,JACK,Can I ... Sorry. Can I just say something? Skarra? You once told me you'd rather die them live another day as a Goa'uld. Why?
0,57,39,SKARRA,What I suffer each day is worse then death.
0,57,39,JACK,For example?
0,57,39,SKARRA,"I remember the demon stretching out my hand to kill Danyer. The husband of my sister. There was nothing I could do to stop it! And I have seen, many more far worse atrocities then this."
0,57,39,ZIPPY,I demand that the humans stay on topic!
0,57,39,JACK,It is on topic! You just want to avoid talking about all the nasty stuff he's witness!
0,57,39,ZIPPY,The host witnesses nothing. Since nothing of the host survives.
0,57,41,SAM,What are they doing?
0,57,41,TEAL'C,I am uncertain.
0,57,43,DANIEL,Lord Zipacna. I would like to ask you a question if I may.
0,57,43,ZIPPY,I hope I'll have the answer.
0,57,43,DANIEL,"I'm sure you will. Is... your host in there, somewhere?"
0,57,43,ZIPPY,Nothing of the host survives.
0,57,43,DANIEL,Really? Than how do you explain Skarra?
0,57,43,ZIPPY,What you call `Skarra' is nothing but a remnant. He can only speak now because the Tollan use their technology to silence Klorel.
0,57,43,DANIEL,"But, how could he speak at all if he hadn't survived?"
0,57,43,LYA,And he spoke well. His words were not those of a remnant personality.
0,57,45,JACK,Carter?
0,57,45,SAM,"Sir, we may have a problem."
0,57,45,JACK,Do tell.
0,57,45,TEAL'C,We tracked a Serpent guard and two Jaffa just outside the cities limits. We observed them locate at least six Tollan weapon sites.
0,57,45,SAM,"We think that they were doing something to disable them, Sir. Which in my opinion would mean that Zipacna is using the Triad to stall for time to disable the Tollans' defenses. Then take the opportunity to"
0,57,45,JACK,Wipe out the Tollan.
0,57,47,NARIM,Samantha. I hope you've not waited long.
0,57,47,SAM,"No, thank you for coming."
0,57,47,NARIM,It's my pleasure. In fact I am pleased that we were able to be alone together.
0,57,47,SAM,"Narim, I asked you to meet me because I need your help."
0,57,47,NARIM,Samantha I... I have missed you.
0,57,47,SAM,A lot has happened to me since I last saw you.
0,57,47,NARIM,Oh. There is another.
0,57,47,SAM,"No, not in the way that you mean. You see... I was blended with a Tok'ra. And she dies to save my life. And I still have her memories and her feelings."
0,57,47,NARIM,And she is part of you.
0,57,47,SAM,Yes. I can't have a relationship with anyone until I'm absolutely sure of whose feelings... I'm feeling. Do you understand?
0,57,47,NARIM,You are very wise Samantha.
0,57,47,SAM,Well...
0,57,47,NARIM,May I ask then why you have summoned me?
0,57,47,SAM,Teal'c and I have been following the Jaffa that came with the Goa'uld contingent.
0,57,47,NARIM,Samantha why would you do such a thing? I was sure your people would be more diplomatic then this.
0,57,47,SAM,We did it out of concern for your people. We think that the Goa'uld are using the Triad to by time so they can prepare for an attack on Tollana.
0,57,47,NARIM,Why do you think that?
0,57,47,SAM,Because we saw they tampering with your weapons.
0,57,47,NARIM,That is impossible. The weapons are made of an impenetrable alloy and protected by security codes.
0,57,47,SAM,Narim. They were doing something to them.
0,57,49,TRAVELL,We asked Lord Zipacna about you accusation. He denied it. And he was quite offended.
0,57,49,JACK,Well that's a shocker. I hope you didn't take his word for it.
0,57,49,TRAVELL,Our experts have been unable to find any form of tampering on any of the canons.
0,57,49,JACK,Carter?
0,57,49,SAM,"Maybe they were painting them, Sir."
0,57,49,TRAVELL,I see no paint.
0,57,49,SAM,Sorry. It's an old Earth military expression. It means marking them as targets.
0,57,49,TRAVELL,Nor do I see any markings.
0,57,49,SAM,"Well, there are ways that they could target the weapons without actually leaving a mark."
0,57,49,TRAVELL,"If so, the instant one of the weapons is attacked the rest will automatically locate the attacker and destroy it."
0,57,49,JACK,Unless they're all taken out simultaneously.
0,57,49,TRAVELL,"If that were possible, why then did the Goa'uld Heru'ur not do so when in pursued of Klorel?"
0,57,49,SAM,Well maybe because he didn't have a contingent on the planet's surface to target the weapons in advance.
0,57,49,TRAVELL,"He didn't do it because it is impossible. It would take but on of these devices to protect this planet from a Goa'uld mother ship and we have many more then that. Our technology is much superior in every way to theirs, and to yours."
0,57,50,JACK,My aren't we cocky.
0,57,50,TRAVELL,"Colonel, if this is an attempt to influence the outcome of Triad, it is a feeble attempt indeed."
0,57,50,DANIEL,I assure you your Eminence that this not intended as anything other then an attempt to help your people.
0,57,50,TRAVELL,"I hope so. But understand if you continue to pursue this matter in any way, I will disqualify you from Triad and replace you. Skarra will be represented by someone else. Is that understood?"
0,57,50,JACK,With protest.
0,57,50,TRAVELL,"Now, you will return to Triad in the morning and you will not mention this matter any further."
0,57,52,JACK,Just stay away from Zippy and his gaggle of Goa'uld. Okay?
0,57,52,TEAL'C,I know the Goa'uld O'Neill. They will attack.
0,57,52,JACK,But I don't see a choice here. If we keep pursuing the issue Skarra will be represented by God knows who and we won't stand a chance in hell. I'm not gonna let that happen.
0,57,52,TEAL'C,Regrettably I must disagree in this situation O'Neil. I believe that we are face with the loss of Skarra one individual verse the deaths of many Tollan and possibly ourselves.
0,57,52,DANIEL,"And that's assuming the Tollan can't defend themselves, which personally I think that's a false assumption."
0,57,52,JACK,"Yeah, they did bring down a couple mother ships. I think they'll be okay."
0,57,52,TEAL'C,The Tollan have not been at war in many generations. They do not think strategically. I believe that to be a fatal flaw.
0,57,52,SAM,Their naiveté could be their downfall.
0,57,52,TEAL'C,That is correct. Allow Major Carter and my self to continue monitoring the Goa'uld contingent in case of
0,57,53,NARIM,Excuse my interruption. The Triad resumes.
0,57,54,JACK,You've got your orders. Stand down.
0,57,57,LYA,Teal'c. This is highly inappropriate for you to come to me during Triad.
0,57,57,TEAL'C,I assure you I would never intend to influence your decision in any way. I wish to speak to you concerning another matter.
0,57,57,LYA,You must not mention Klorel or Skarra. If you do I will be forced to report the matter to the Tollan.
0,57,57,TEAL'C,Understood.
0,57,57,LYA,What is it then?
0,57,57,TEAL'C,As you are aware I was formerly in the service of the Goa'uld.
0,57,57,LYA,If this is deigned to biased me against the Goa'uld
0,57,57,TEAL'C,I would never do such a thing nor do I feel the need. I am here in fact in direct violation of an order by Colonel O'Neill.
0,57,57,LYA,Go on.
0,57,57,TEAL'C,"I have become convinced that the Goa'uld are planning to destroy all the Tollan weapon instillations simultaneously thereby preventing them form ever returning fire. The Goa'uld will then attack this world, which will be defenseless."
0,57,57,LYA,Why do you tell me this?
0,57,57,TEAL'C,I believe that you and I are the only ones able of preventing this tragedy from occurring.
0,57,57,LYA,"You and I? Teal'c, you are a strong warrior, but I am of the Nox. If you have learned anything of us you have learned that we defend ourselves through illusion and mastery of the mind."
0,57,57,TEAL'C,Precisely.
0,57,59,LYA,I apologize for my tardiness.
0,57,60,TRAVELL,We will resume. Lord Zipacna has asked us to reconvene early because he wishes to make a challenge.
0,57,60,ZIPPY,Tollan law does not provide for a penalty of death. Is that right?
0,57,60,TRAVELL,It is.
0,57,60,ZIPPY,"Then I wish to point out the futility to this Triad. A Goa'uld needs a host to survive. This is a biological fact, beyond our control. If you allow priority to Skarra, it is of a death sentence for Klorel."
0,57,60,JACK,"Of course, if you flip that around you got Skarra on death row."
0,57,60,ZIPPY,"Yes, but as proved earlier in Triad, the host survives."
0,57,60,JACK,Yeah?
0,57,60,ZIPPY,"We can see this point. There fore if you provide priority to Klorel, both host and symbiote live."
0,57,60,JACK,"Yeah, one lives freely, the other lives as a slave."
0,57,60,DANIEL,We would put forth that life as a slave is not life at all.
0,57,60,JACK,"And if you want to save both lives... give us Skarra, you take Klorel. Tok'ra can... put him in another host for all I care."
0,57,60,LYA,Who Colonel? Perhaps you would volunteer?
0,57,60,JACK,Uhh... no.
0,57,60,DANIEL,Perhaps you could find someone who would choose to be a host.
0,57,61,TRAVELL,Narim? What is the meaning of this? You know Triad is held as a closed session.
0,57,62,NARIM,"You Eminence, please adjust your viewer to the orbital observatory."
0,57,63,TRAVELL,A Goa'uld mother ship...
0,57,63,NARIM,Yes. It approaches Tollana.
0,57,64,TRAVELL,Explain.
0,57,64,ZIPPY,My vessel comes in anticipation of our victory of Triad. It is merely coming to take us along.
0,57,64,JACK,Why don't you just take the Stargate like the rest of us?
0,57,64,ZIPPY,Not that it is of your concern but there is no Chapp'ai where we are going.
0,57,64,JACK,Well then gate to where there is one and get picked up.
0,57,64,ZIPPY,"You Eminence, if our intentions were hostile, we would have attacked already."
0,57,64,TRAVELL,"Even so, your ships arrival is premature and in violation of Tollan space. I must warn you, that if you ship moves any closer before the conclusion of Triad, our automated defense system will destroy it."
0,57,64,ZIPPY,The Goa'uld rest our case and we are prepared to vote. Therefore Triad is over.
0,57,64,TRAVELL,"Triad is over when all parties agree, Lord Zipacna. Do the human archons have any further arguments?"
0,57,64,JACK,Nope. I think the Goa'uld made our case for us quite nicely.
0,57,64,DANIEL,No further arguments you Eminence we are prepared to vote.
0,57,64,TRAVELL,Nox archon?
0,57,64,LYA,Yes.
0,57,64,TRAVELL,Then bring in the seekers.
0,57,65,TRAVELL,"Klorel and Skarra, you can both hear the Triads ruling?"
0,57,65,SKARRA,"Yes, your Eminence."
0,57,66,KLOREL,I can.
0,57,66,TRAVELL,Human archons. May we hear your vote?
0,57,66,DANIEL,We find in favor of Skarra.
0,57,66,TRAVELL,Goa'uld archon?
0,57,66,ZIPPY,We're in favor of Klorel.
0,57,66,JACK,Big surprise there...
0,57,66,TRAVELL,Nox archon?
0,57,66,LYA,"After careful consideration, I believe that both Klorel and Skarra have the right to live. But, living as a host with no right of ones own, is not life. Therefore, only one can remain in the body. To that end, I award priority to the original owner of the body. Skarra."
0,57,67,JACK,Yes. Now get that mother ship outta here.
0,57,67,TRAVELL,"We will summon the Tok'ra to come to Tollana to assist in the removal of the Goa'uld Klorel. He will be removed from that host and if he survives, will be sent to a Goa'uld world of his choice."
0,57,68,TRAVELL,"I have locked the detachment device. Skarra, you have priority control until the Goa'uld is removed. Prepare yourself. The Tok'ra will arrive as soon as possible. And congratulations."
0,57,68,SKARRA,Thank you.
0,57,68,TRAVELL,Lord Zipacna. You are dismissed. With our thanks.
0,57,69,ZIPPY,Ritak. Reenok ha'tak
0,57,70,JACK,Nice. Let's go!
0,57,72,JACK,Skarra! Wait here! Just trust me!
0,57,74,JACK,How's that superior technology looking now? Security system serving you pretty good is it?
0,57,75,DANIEL,The ion canons.
0,57,75,JACK,"Got a dead lock on all of them. You know, I hate when people waste my time like this."
0,57,75,DANIEL,Where's Teal'c?
0,57,76,SAM,Colonel!
0,57,77,JACK,Cover!
0,57,78,NARIM,I must inform Travell!
0,57,79,TEAL'C,Zipacna has escaped through the Stargate.
0,57,79,JACK,Well that's the least of our prob... Where have you been?
0,57,79,TEAL'C,I must inform you O'Neill that I have disregarded your orders concerning the Goa'uld.
0,57,79,JACK,Please explain.
0,57,81,JACK,So what's going on here?
0,57,81,TEAL'C,I have requested Lya's assistance.
0,57,82,SAM,You hid one of them.
0,57,82,TEAL'C,That is correct. Travell explained that is would take but one of these to destroy a Goa'uld mother ship.
0,57,83,TEAL'C,It should have already fired.
0,57,83,JACK,Well it hasn't. Let's take cover huh?
0,57,85,JACK,Very nice.
0,57,88,TRAVELL,You disregarded my warnings.
0,57,88,JACK,Mine too... Well done.
0,57,88,TRAVELL,"If you were my subject I would be forced to discipline you. However, you are not one of my subjects."
0,57,89,TEAL'C,It could not have been done without the assistance of Lya.
0,57,89,SAM,I thought the Nox were pacifists?
0,57,89,LYA,I only hid the weapon. I did not fire it.
0,57,89,SAM,Ah... Pretty fine line you didn't cross.
0,57,89,LYA,Yes it is.
0,57,89,JACK,"So... we basically saved your whole planet, right?"
0,57,89,TRAVELL,Yes.
0,57,89,JACK,Are you therefore indebted to us is any modest way?
0,57,89,TRAVELL,I suppose that is the case.
0,57,89,JACK,"So, how about giving us the plans to build one of those ion canons?"
0,57,89,TRAVELL,You have been told our policy. That has not changed.
0,57,90,DANIEL,The uhh... the Tok'ra have completed the procedure.
0,57,90,JACK,Yeah...?
0,57,91,LYA,What will become of Klorel?
0,57,91,NARIM,He will be sent to a Goa'uld world.
0,57,91,JACK,The hell with him what about
0,57,91,SKARRA,O'Neer!
0,57,92,JACK,Much better.
