0,6,0,"""THE NOX""",By Hart Hanson The Stargate is opened
0,6,0,SOLDER,Stargate in motion!
0,6,0,HARRIMAN,Chevron six encoded.
0,6,1,HAMMOND,Better hang on to something Mr. Secretary. This is how we open the front door around here.
0,6,1,HARRIMAN,"Chevron seven, Launch."
0,6,1,SECRETARY,"My God, General it."
0,6,1,HAMMOND,I thought you might be impressed.
0,6,1,SECRETARY,What exactly am I looking at?
0,6,1,SAM,"We think your looking at an even horizon of an artificial-created wormhole, through our space time to a point tens, even hundreds of light years away. Sir."
0,6,1,SECRETARY,Uh-huh.
0,6,1,HARRIMAN,
0,6,1,SECRETARY,And do we know where theyre going?
0,6,1,HAMMOND,The planets designation is P3C-117.
0,6,1,SECRETARY,Do you have any idea what's out there?
0,6,1,JACK,No sir that would be why we're going.
0,6,1,SECRETARY,"I'm not sure Colonel, is it? Because to be perfectly frank this administration is not satisfied with the current progress of the Stargate program."
0,6,1,SAM,"Begging the secretarys pardon, sir, but we've already visited 19 separate worlds."
0,6,1,HAMMOND,I believe he is referring specifically to the volume of technology being returned on your planetary missions.
0,6,1,SECRETARY,The president and Joint Chiefs were under the impression that the SG teams would bring back superior technologies.
0,6,1,DANNY,"I'm sorry, I thought we were explorers."
0,6,1,SECRETARY,"Oh you are Dr. Jackson, but even Marco Polo when he came back from the far east brought more then just a few exotic spices."
0,6,1,JACK,"Mr. Secretary, it's been my observation, that, whether it's out here on earth or out there, cultures with advanced technology tend not to like to share it."
0,6,1,SECRETARY,So we're wasting our time?
0,6,1,JACK,Would you interpret what I just said as.?
0,6,1,HAMMOND,Colonel.
0,6,1,SAM,"Sir, with respect, this program is quite probably humanities most important endeavor."
0,6,1,SECRETARY,"They said the something about the Apollo program, they brought back moon rocks. You may have noticed we haven't been to the moon in 25 years."
0,6,1,JACK,What kind of comparison is that?'
0,6,1,SECRETARY,"Colonel, if one of those Goa'uld ships were coming here right now, have you brought back one thing we can fight them off with?"
0,6,1,TEAL'C,What technology do you seek?
0,6,1,SECRETARY,"You tell me, what's out there?"
0,6,1,TEAL'C,"There are still technologies even the Goa'uld seek. There is a creator that lives on an unpopulated world, it possesses powers of invisibility."
0,6,1,SECRETARY,Invisibility? As in stealth?
0,6,1,TEAL'C,"That is correct, it can appear and disappear at will. I was once commanded to retrieve the creature, to leer it's secrets. Apophis took the lives of two of my men as punishment for failure to retrieve it."
0,6,1,SAM,"If we manage to capture one alive, it could provide us with a serious tactical advantage the next time we came against the Goa'uld."
0,6,1,JACK,Sounds like a mission to me.
0,6,2,JACK,Carter? Daniel! Teal'c!
0,6,2,SAM,Here sir.
0,6,2,JACK,What have we got?
0,6,2,SAM,"I thought I saw something just as we came through, sir."
0,6,2,JACK,Teal'c? Did we score already?
0,6,2,TEAL'C,"I saw movement as well, this way."
0,6,2,JACK,I hope these things are as big as you say they are. There is enough tranquilizer in these darts to knock out a Rhino.
0,6,2,TEAL'C,"They are very large, but extremely maneuverable in the air. We will find them most vulnerable when they hover."
0,6,2,DANNY,Hover? Like a hummingbird?
0,6,2,TEAL'C,With teeth.
0,6,2,JACK,"Alright, well there's nothing out there.Let's get back to the gear and...where's the Stargate?"
0,6,4,JACK,I don't like this.
0,6,4,DANNY,"To Teal'c, Did anything like this ever happen to you before?"
0,6,4,TEAL'C,"It has not, if we became misdirected, and needed to locate the Stargate, we had a Goa'uld homing device to find it."
0,6,4,DANNY,Do we have a homing device?
0,6,4,JACK,"Course we do, it's with the gear."
0,6,4,DANNY,Which is by the Stargate.
0,6,4,JACK,"Captain, let's start a box search. You and Teal'c take off in that direction, stay in radio contact."
0,6,4,SAM,"Yes, Sir."
0,6,4,JACK,"Daniel, you're with me."
0,6,5,DANNY,There.
0,6,6,DANIEL,"I just hope it becomes visible once we traq it, otherwise will never be able find it."
0,6,6,JACK,"Teal'c, what the hell are you doing?"
0,6,6,TEAL'C,It did not come from me.
0,6,6,JACK,Oh.
0,6,7,TEAL'C,You are certain it was Apophis?
0,6,7,JACK,Oh yeah.
0,6,7,DANNY,"Okay, what are we gonna do? We have to do something."
0,6,7,JACK,That's not our mission.
0,6,7,DANNY,"Ah, just forget our mission. Now he's the only one who knows where Sha're and Skaara are, we may not get another chance like this."
0,6,7,JACK,What kind of entourage is he gonna have with him?
0,6,7,TEAL'C,Two perhaps three Jaffa guards.
0,6,7,SAM,"Are we seriously entertaining the idea of going after Apophis? Sir, we're not prepared for an attack! Half the ordnance we're carrying is tranquilizer guns."
0,6,7,DANNY,"So we use one of them to knock him out. He will wake up in a holding cell with out his guards, without his technology, he will have no choice but to tell us everything we want to know about Goa'uld technology, about were Sha're is."
0,6,7,JACK,Can I remind you that we don't know where the Stargate is?
0,6,7,TEAL'C,He will have the Goa'uld homing device I spoke of.
0,6,7,DANNY,There you are.
0,6,7,JACK,"Alright, you know what were up against better then anyone, can we do what Daniel is talking about?"
0,6,7,TEAL'C,"We have the element of surprise, I have my staff weapon. If we eliminate his personal guard quickly, I believe so."
0,6,7,JACK,"Teal'c, this character used to be a God to you, you're sure you're okay with this?"
0,6,7,TEAL'C,I am okay.
0,6,7,JACK,"Okay, Carter?"
0,6,7,SAM,If were going to do this we better plan the attack very carefully.
0,6,8,SAM,Colonel!
0,6,9,APOPHIS,"Teal'c, Sholva!"
0,6,9,TEAL'C,Tal'shek 'ka mel. I die free.
0,6,11,SAM,"Hey, what are you doing?"
0,6,11,DANNY,"I felt that blast kill me, I mean, I thought I thought we were dead, weren't we dead?"
0,6,11,SAM,Yeah.
0,6,11,DANNY,"Okay, well I thought Heaven would be a little more upscale."
0,6,11,SAM,"Oh, I don't think this is Heaven."
0,6,11,DANNY,Jack?Jack.
0,6,11,JACK,What? God.
0,6,11,DANNY,It's okay.
0,6,11,JACK,What the hell was that?
0,6,11,DANNY,It's okay.
0,6,11,JACK,Wasn't I just?
0,6,11,SAM,Killed.
0,6,11,JACK,Killed as in.
0,6,11,SAM,Dead.
0,6,11,JACK,Dead.
0,6,11,SAM,"Yeah, we know we saw it happen. Same thing happened to us."
0,6,11,JACK,"Well, this is a surprise then."
0,6,11,DANNY,I don't know what happened to Teal'c.
0,6,11,SAM,"Colonel, my side arms gone."
0,6,11,JACK,So is mine.
0,6,12,DANNY,"Hello.Hi, I'm Daniel Jackson. This is Captain Carter and this is..."
0,6,12,JACK,"Colonel Jack O'Neill, SG-1. Sorry to drop in on you like this but we were dead."
0,6,12,SAM,Do you know where our friend is? Another like us.
0,6,13,DANNY,"Is this your village? Aresh? Tao Aki? We need to find our friend, Teal'c."
0,6,13,JACK,"Ah...fruit. Nothing like coming back from the dead to build up an apetite. Thank you, thank you very much."
0,6,13,DANNY,Did you do this? Did you heal us? I think they're a family.
0,6,13,JACK,"Speaks softly back, of what?"
0,6,13,DANNY,I have no idea.
0,6,13,JACK,"Well we should ask them to give us back our weapons.Listen, those things you found on us, those things you took from us, the big things, they're very dangerous and.. Hey..Teal'c, thank God.Please tell me you know whats going on around here."
0,6,13,TEAL'C,I cannot tell you that.
0,6,13,JACK,"What about Apophis, you got a line on him?"
0,6,13,TEAL'C,I do not.
0,6,13,JACK,Any idea how far away from the Stargate we might be?
0,6,13,TEAL'C,I believe us to be...
0,6,13,NEFRAYU,Nafrayu.
0,6,13,SAM,Nafrayu. Carter.
0,6,13,NEFRAYU,Carter.
0,6,13,JACK,"No, you can't keep him."
0,6,17,JACK,Maybe you should ask them about the Stargate.
0,6,17,DANNY,"I have, they don't understand. Actually they don't really say much at all. At the moment I'm trying to figure out if theyre human."
0,6,17,SAM,Theyre fairly human.
0,6,17,MAN,I will take you to your doorway.
0,6,17,JACK,Whoa.
0,6,17,DANNY,You understand what I'm saying?
0,6,17,MAN,It took time to learn your speech.
0,6,17,SAM,Not much time.
0,6,17,MAN,Your weapons are gone.
0,6,17,JACK,Gone where?
0,6,17,SAM,You know about our enemy?
0,6,17,JACK,"The bad guys, They'll be following us."
0,6,17,WOMAN,You attacked them.
0,6,17,DANNY,You saw?
0,6,17,SAM,We only mean't to capture hem.
0,6,17,JACK,"Look we're not in the assassination business, he's just bad. Very..."
0,6,17,DANNY,Bad.
0,6,17,JACK,Bad. We just wanted to take him back to our world and have a chat with him about all the nasty...
0,6,17,JACK AND DANIEL,Bad.
0,6,17,JACK,Things he's been doing.We just didn't know about this little force field deal
0,6,17,TEAL'C,"I have never seen such a device, if I had."
0,6,17,JACK,"It's alright, we're alive thanks to you folks."
0,6,17,MAN,We will take you to your doorway. You will go.
0,6,17,SAM,As inthe Stargate?
0,6,17,WOMAN,"Yes, you will go?"
0,6,17,JACK,"Well, it's not quite that simple."
0,6,17,TEAL'C,"By rescuing us, you have put yourselves in great danger. Apophis will try to locate us."
0,6,17,MAN,"Rest now, you will leave soon. Take your ways with you."
0,6,17,JACK,"No, wait, wait. You helped us. You saved us."
0,6,17,MAN,Yes.
0,6,17,JACK,How?
0,6,17,MAN,Our ways.
0,6,17,DANNY,"We're from a race of people who want to learn about your ways, your medicine."
0,6,17,MAN,No.
0,6,17,JACK,Is there anyone else we could talk to? Do you have a leader?
0,6,17,MAN,They have no wish to see you.
0,6,17,JACK,So there are others.
0,6,17,MAN,You will go.
0,6,17,JACK,Right...we'll go.
0,6,17,TEAL'C,"If you wish us to leave, should we not depart now?"
0,6,17,WOMAN,Your brother won't revive until later.
0,6,17,JACK,Excuse me? Whose brother?
0,6,18,WOMAN,He resisted our attempts to help him heal.
0,6,18,TEAL'C,"He may yet survive, the Goa'uld he carries is healing him even now."
0,6,18,MAN,That is good.
0,6,18,JACK,"How is that good, I mean he is in the service of the Goa'uld."
0,6,18,MAN,He is like him.
0,6,18,JACK,He's with us.
0,6,18,WOMAN,Perhaps you can convince the injured one to join you as well?
0,6,18,SAM,"Oh, I dont think so"
0,6,18,DANIEL,The Goa'uld are a parasitic race. They take life and use it for there own purpose.
0,6,18,JACK,"And their ways are not like your ways, believe me."
0,6,18,MAN,They do not know the Nox.
0,6,18,DANIEL,That's you? The Nox?
0,6,18,WOMAN,The ones you speak of come to hunt the Fenri.
0,6,18,JACK,"Fenri, what?"
0,6,18,DANIEL,"That's probably that disappearing, invisible, flying thing we were after."
0,6,18,MAN,"Yes, Fenri."
0,6,18,JACK,"Alright, look, do you have any elders, I could speak with I don't think your understanding what I'm..."
0,6,18,MAN,Oper is one of the oldest of the Nox.
0,6,18,TEAL'C,"If Shak'l does not die, they will be in even greater danger then they are now."
0,6,18,MAN,There will be no more death.
0,6,18,TEAL'C,"I have no intention of killing him. However, if Shak'l does survive his injuries he will tell the Goa'uld where to find you."
0,6,18,JACK,"Look, obviously your medicine is very, well it's very effective. But how do you defend yourselves?"
0,6,18,MAN,We don't.
0,6,18,SAM,Then at least let us help you in exchange for what you did for us.
0,6,18,MAN,You must go.
0,6,18,JACK,"Right. Well for now, well just go over here. Excuse me."
0,6,19,JACK,"Alright, do you know this Shak'l?"
0,6,19,TEALC,He served in my command when I was first prime of Apophis.
0,6,19,SAM,"Well, we can't just walk away. I mean if we hadn't attracted Apophis, he wouldn't even be here."
0,6,19,DANIEL,"And we can't kill him either.I wasn't considering it, I was just stating a fact."
0,6,19,JACK,"Okay, we'll take Shak'l back, it's not quite as good as having Apophis, but he can't stay here."
0,6,19,TEAL'C,"Apophis will not allow us to leave this world alive. You have challenged him, and I have betrayed him. Even if we were to locate the Stargate, leaving this world will be difficult."
0,6,19,SAM,"So we're back to square one. We can't leave Shak'l here and we can't get him back to the gate, without running in to Apophis."
0,6,19,JACK,"Okay, we'll try and learn everything we can about the Nox, it's part of why we came here right? In the meantime, I think you better check on your friend. Whatever we end up doing, I don't think he is going to wake up in a very good mood. Know what I mean?"
0,6,20,JAFFA,"Apophis, Kree. Shak'l Tak."
0,6,20,APOPHIS,"Teal'c was standing before me, waiting to pay the price of his betrayal, I had him in my hand!"
0,6,20,JAFFA,We have searched.
0,6,20,APOPHIS,"Where are the others? Where is Shak'l? I saw them die, they could not just disappear. Unless they have learned the power of the beast."
0,6,21,LYA,Must he be bound so tight?
0,6,21,TEAL'C,"If not, he will escape when he awakens."
0,6,21,LYA,"He deceives you, he's awake now!"
0,6,21,TEAL'C,"Were you waiting for me to turn my back, Shak'l?"
0,6,21,SHAK'L,As you taught me. Have you come to kill me?
0,6,21,TEAL'C,I offer you the chance to join me. The Goa'uld are not gods.
0,6,21,SHAK'L,Lies.
0,6,21,TEAL'C,These people are that of the first world. The Tau'ri.
0,6,21,SHAK'L,"You waist your breath. I shall rest, strengthen by the thought of the reword I shall get when I present your head, to Apophis."
0,6,21,TEAL'C,"The time of Apophis, will soon end. And on that day, I will return to our world, and offer freedom to all Jaffa. It is ashamed you will not live to see it. For when you fail to kill me, it will be your head."
0,6,22,DANNY,I really don't get the point of this.
0,6,23,JACK,"Well, if we run into Apophis again, will be prepared."
0,6,23,DANNY,But what good are bows and arrows gonna do against that kind of fire power?
0,6,23,JACK,Exactly how I want him to think.
0,6,23,DANNY,Yeah.
0,6,23,SAM,Any weapon is better then no weapon when it comes to survival.
0,6,23,DANIEL,"You guys just don't want to give up, do you?"
0,6,23,JACK,No.
0,6,23,SAM,That's what happens when you spend most your life in Special Forces.
0,6,23,DANIEL,Somehow I don't think we'd make very good Nox.
0,6,23,JACK,I think you're right
0,6,23,NEFRAYU,Is that a weapon?
0,6,23,JACK,"Yes, and you can't have it."
0,6,24,NEFRAYU,If you blunted this stick this would be good for knocking fruit from the highest branches.
0,6,24,JACK,"Yeah, I bet it would."
0,6,24,NEFRAYU,Why do you want to fight them?
0,6,24,JACK,I don't want to.
0,6,24,NEFRAYU,Then don't.
0,6,24,JACK,"It's not that simple. Look, I believe in peace, just like you, I do."
0,6,24,NEFRAYU,Then why do you fight?
0,6,24,JACK,"Because our enemy gives us no option, sometimes turning the other cheek just doesn't work."
0,6,24,NEFRAYU,I'll learn to understand them better.
0,6,24,JACK,"No, I wouldn't do that if I were you."
0,6,25,JACK,"Go on, run. Run!"
0,6,27,OPER,Mmm. You?
0,6,27,DANIEL,"Oh, no, thank you. I'm trying to quit. Is that where you get your medicine, the forest?"
0,6,27,OPER,"We get life from the forest, from everything."
0,6,27,DANIEL,"But you must have medicine. Or you must have some knowledge that we don't have, I guess what I'm saying is, we could learn a lot from you, I really wish that we could be friends with the Nox. Friends share knowledge with each other."
0,6,27,OPER,"Yes, you have much to learn."
0,6,27,DANIEL,"Well, why don't you teach me now? For example you seem to have an almost psychic ability. Are you born with it?"
0,6,27,OPER,Knowledge takes time. Over the years we teach the young to be wise.
0,6,27,DANIEL,How old are you?
0,6,27,OPER,How do you mark time?
0,6,27,DANIEL,"Years, days; ah a day is one revolution of our planet, a year is one revolution around our sun, there are 365 days in one year so..."
0,6,27,OPER,Then I am four hundred and thirty-two years old.
0,6,27,DANIEL,"Well, you look great."
0,6,27,OPER,Thank you.
0,6,28,ANTEAUS,You will not teach Nafrayu your ways.
0,6,28,JACK,How'd you do that?
0,6,28,ANTEAUS,"It is not the Fenri that have the ability to hide, it is the Nox."
0,6,28,JACK,So you hid the Stargate?
0,6,28,ANTEAUS,"The Fenri was near by when you came through, attracted by your arrival. We conceal them until the hunters are gone."
0,6,28,JACK,We're not hunters.
0,6,28,ANTEAUS,You tried to kill the Fenri a moment ago.
0,6,28,JACK,I was trying to protect the boy.
0,6,28,ANTEAUS,You protect his body after poisoning his mind.
0,6,28,JACK,"Will you listen to me? The reason the Goa'uld hunt those flying things is because they want to know how it's able to disappear, if they find out it's you."
0,6,28,ANTEAUS,Our ways have served us for as long as our people have lived.
0,6,28,JACK,"But they didn't know you existed before. Once they know they'll enslave you, it's what they do."
0,6,28,ANTEAUS,We are slaves to no-one.
0,6,29,DANIEL,How long have the Goa'uld been coming here to hunt?
0,6,29,OPER,"Oh, as long as I can remember."
0,6,29,DANIEL,"Why did you not bury the Stargate, do you know that that would stop them?"
0,6,29,OPER,And they would know someone had buried it.
0,6,29,DANIEL,"Right, of course."
0,6,30,DANIEL,Oper is 432 years old.
0,6,30,JACK,"Well, guess what? They're not human."
0,6,30,DANIEL,"No, they're humanoid, but definitely more advanced than anything that has evolved on Earth."
0,6,30,JACK,"That creature that we came here for, it has no power at all. None. Zip."
0,6,30,SAM,"Well then, how does it become invisible?"
0,6,30,JACK,They do it. The Nox hide it from us.
0,6,30,DANIEL,They make it invisible to protect it.
0,6,30,SAM,"Well, this makes things even worse."
0,6,30,DANIEL,If Apophis finds out that it's them that have this power.
0,6,30,TEAL'C,"He will try to possess it, if he finds he cannot he will bombard this planet's surface from high above. What he cannot possess he destroys."
0,6,30,JACK,"So, we've gotta get Shak'l out of here."
0,6,31,ANTEAUS,We will not allow you.
0,6,31,JACK,Will you stop doing that!
0,6,31,ANTEAUS,You cannot be trusted with your enemy.
0,6,31,JACK,"Look, if we don't take him away from here, he'll tell the Goa'uld,the bad guys, all about you"
0,6,31,ANTEAUS,We are not afraid.
0,6,31,JACK,"Well, get afraid!"
0,6,31,DANIEL,"Colonel. Look, this is our fault that this has happened, we know that and we want to correct that."
0,6,31,SAM,"Shak'l won't be hurt, you have our word."
0,6,31,DANIEL,"We'll just take him away with us, back to our planet, only then will you be safe."
0,6,31,ANTEAUS,Only if that is his wish.
0,6,32,APOPHIS,"Jaffa, kree."
0,6,32,JAFFA,I cannot find the Stargate.
0,6,32,APOPHIS,Then find me Teal'c!
0,6,33,TEAL'C,"Jaffa, I offer you this last chance to join me."
0,6,33,SHAK'L,Before you kill me? You're too much of a coward or you would've done it already.
0,6,33,TEAL'C,I have no wish to kill you.
0,6,33,SHAK'L,You may wish you had.
0,6,33,LYA,What have you done to him?
0,6,34,TEAL'C,O'Neill!
0,6,34,JACK,Teal'c!
0,6,34,TEAL'C,The Nox woman.
0,6,34,DANIEL,Where'd the Nox go with Lya?
0,6,34,JACK,Who knows where they ever go.
0,6,34,TEAL'C,I trained him well.
0,6,34,JACK,Is he gonna be alright?
0,6,34,SAM,"Well, if it were you or me."
0,6,34,TEAL'C,My wound will heal. We must find Shak'l.
0,6,34,JACK,We will.
0,6,35,JACK,You brought us back the same way?
0,6,35,ANTEAUS,Yes.
0,6,35,TEAL'C,You become visible during the ceremony.
0,6,35,ANTEAUS,When we are performing the ritual of life we are unable to shield ourselves.
0,6,35,TEAL'C,A weakness.
0,6,35,ANTEAUS,We are hidden again.
0,6,36,TEAL'C,Shak'l has been this way.
0,6,36,JACK,How long ago was he here? Teal'c?
0,6,36,TEAL'C,He is very skilled at evading capture.
0,6,36,JACK,Did you teach him that too?
0,6,37,NEFRAYU,"I am curious to see a Goa'uld, I have never seen one."
0,6,37,JACK,"No. You should go some place where it's safe, go where the other Nox are."
0,6,37,NEFRAYU,They are far away.
0,6,37,JACK,"Nafrayu, please, go on, scoot. Kids."
0,6,38,SHAK'L,Eis'thra! Eis'thra!
0,6,38,TEAL'C,"He is telling him of the Nox, about their powers, Apophis will be pleased."
0,6,39,ANTEAUS,Nothing has changed for us.
0,6,39,JACK,"No, everything has changed."
0,6,39,ANTEAUS,We will take you to the doorway.
0,6,39,JACK,"Look, Anteaus, we can came back through that gate, we can bring reinforcements."
0,6,39,OPER,"Anteaus, where is Nafrayu?"
0,6,40,NEFRAYU,Nefrayu.
0,6,40,APOPHIS,Nefrayu?
0,6,42,JACK,I told him to go home.
0,6,42,ANTEAUS,I told you the same. The very young do not always do what they are told.
0,6,43,JACK,"Feel like a trap to you, Captain?"
0,6,43,SAM,"Yes, Sir."
0,6,43,LYA,We must begin the ritual.
0,6,43,JACK,"No, wait."
0,6,43,DANIEL,"Jack, they can bring him back."
0,6,43,TEAL'C,"Shak'l has told Apophis of your ritual, that you cannot remain hidden when you perform it."
0,6,43,ANTEAUS,But we must.
0,6,43,JACK,"The minute you start that ritual, they'll attack."
0,6,43,SAM,"Give us our weapons, we can defend you."
0,6,43,ANTEAUS,There will be no killing.
0,6,43,JACK,"Alright, fine. We'll find our own way back to the Stargate, we're certainly not gonna sit around here and watch a slaughter.Let's go."
0,6,43,DANIEL,Jack!
0,6,43,JACK,That's an order.
0,6,43,DANIEL,"Please, we were just.We were trying to help."
0,6,43,ANTEAUS,"Goodbye, Daniel."
0,6,43,JACK,Think they bought it?
0,6,43,SAM,Almost believed it myself.
0,6,43,LYA,We could take Nafrayu to the others.
0,6,43,ANTEAUS,It would take too long.
0,6,44,DANIEL,Where did that come from?
0,6,44,JACK,"Well, the wee folk missed one. So Shak'l thinks we're unarmed, Apophis thinks he's invulnerable."
0,6,44,DANIEL,And they're right. I think I found a flaw in your plan.
0,6,44,JACK,"Their weapons aren't as affective in close, we'll be better off with hand to hand."
0,6,44,TEAL'C,"What of Apophis? He's protected by an energy field, we both fired our weapons directly at it."
0,6,44,JACK,Did you see what happened when one of his guards tossed him a staff weapon?
0,6,44,SAM,Passed right through.So you're guessing that the shield's deflection capability is directly proportional to the amount of kinetic energy being directed at it?
0,6,44,JACK,Yeah.
0,6,44,DANIEL,"So you're saying that an arrow or dart being much slower in velocity than, say, a bullet.."
0,6,44,SAM,"Just might make it through. It's a big gamble, Sir."
0,6,44,JACK,"Yeah, you ready?"
0,6,45,DANIEL,Theyre coming.
0,6,46,APOPHIS,"Fool, I will kill you."
0,6,46,JACK,Again?
0,6,49,TEAL'C,This is where the Stargate should be.
0,6,50,ANTEAUS,We sent your enemy through the doorway.
0,6,50,JACK,They'll be back.
0,6,50,ANTEAUS,When you are gone we will bury it.
0,6,50,JACK,They'll come in ships next time; they'll bring an army.
0,6,50,ANTEAUS,Perhaps.He wanted to wish you farewell.
0,6,50,JACK,I'm glad you're okay.
0,6,50,NEFRAYU,And you. We sent your weapons back through the doorway.
0,6,50,JACK,"Yeah, speaking of the Stargate."
0,6,50,ANTEAUS,"You fear for us, yes?"
0,6,50,JACK,Yes.
0,6,50,ANTEAUS,Why?
0,6,50,TEAL'C,It is our way that the strong defend the weak.
0,6,50,JACK,We're afraid for you.
0,6,50,ANTEAUS,"Before you go, O'Neill, there is something we would have you see."
0,6,51,JACK,Oh my God.
0,6,51,ANTEAUS,Fear not.
0,6,52,ANTEAUS,"Maybe one day you will learn, that your way is not the only way."
0,6,53,JACK,Why didn't he tell us about this before?
0,6,53,DANIEL,"I think, in their way, they did."
0,6,53,TEAL'C,It appears they possess a form of technology far greater than that of the Goa'uld.
0,6,53,SAM,They looked so helpless.
0,6,53,DANIEL,And now they're going to bury the Stargate and we can never come back. We should've listened.
0,6,53,JACK,The very young do not always do as they're told.Just a little something the Nox told me one time. Something worth taking home.
