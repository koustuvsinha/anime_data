0,62,0,"""MATERNAL INSTINCT""",By Robert C. Cooper Off world activation.
0,62,1,TECHNICION,Receiving GDO transmission. It's special code 2 sir.
0,62,1,HAMMOND,Open the Iris.
0,62,2,BRA'TAC,Please. . Help.
0,62,4,FRAISER,He's bleeding internally. We're gonna have to open him up. Operating room 1 now. Lets move it. Go go go!
0,62,5,TEAL'C,Tak'Ma'Ta Bra'tac. Are you in need of medical assistance?
0,62,5,BRA'TAC,The blood is not mine.
0,62,5,TEAL'C,What has transpired?
0,62,5,BRA'TAC,"Chu'lak was attacked, by Apophis."
0,62,6,JACK,Son of a bitch!
0,62,6,TEAL'C,Apophis must have transported off of Sokar's ship before it exploded.
0,62,6,JACK,Well somebodys gotta teach that guy how to die.
0,62,6,BRA'TAC,"He controls the army of Sokar, a most powerful force."
0,62,6,TEAL'C,I will return with you at once.
0,62,6,BRA'TAC,"The fight is over Teal'c. The attack was swift. There was nothing left to do but try to save the life of young Moac, my newest apprentice."
0,62,6,SAM,"Attacking Chu'lak doesnt make sense. I mean all the Jaffa werent willing to oppose the Goa'uld, were they?"
0,62,6,BRA'TAC,No.
0,62,6,DANIEL,Of course its quicker and easier to wipe them all out rahter than try to weed out the traitors.
0,62,7,HAMMOND,"Hammond. I understand. Bra'tac, you better get down to the OR right away."
0,62,8,JANET,We've done everything we can.
0,62,9,MOAC,I have failed you.
0,62,9,BRA'TAC,No. It is I who have failed you. You are the bravest Jaffa I have ever trained.
0,62,9,MOAC,I am scared.
0,62,9,BRA'TAC,Kla'mel'korak.
0,62,10,BRA'TAC,His body is to be burned.
0,62,10,TEAL'C,I will see to it personally.
0,62,10,BRA'TAC,One day I wish to spread Moac ashes on the grave of Apophis. But I do not know if I have the strength to fight anymore.
0,62,10,TEAL'C,"Many have died old friend, but their deaths must not go in vain. Word of this must spread to all Jaffa."
0,62,10,BRA'TAC,Yes. But maybe it is for someone younger and stronger than I to spread that word.
0,62,10,TEAL'C,You are the strongest Jaffa I have ever known.
0,62,10,BRA'TAC,"In my 135 years, I have never seen a Goa'uld turn on those who carry its kind on this way. He massacred so many who worshipped him for so long."
0,62,10,TEAL'C,Perhaps he has done this to show the system lords how truly powerful he has become.
0,62,10,BRA'TAC,You know well Apophis has weapons that could have be used from space. There had to be some other purpose. His armys spread through Chu'lak as if...
0,62,10,TEAL'C,As if they were looking for something.
0,62,11,DANIEL,The Harsesis.
0,62,11,TEAL'C,"Apophis fathered the child with Sha're, the host of his mate Ammonet. He hoped to create a new host for himself."
0,62,11,BRA'TAC,It is forbidden.
0,62,11,DANIEL,"Yes, because the child would contain all the knowledge of the Goauld. Ammonet hid the boy to keep him safe."
0,62,11,BRA'TAC,Of course. The boy would be hunted. He could be the un-doing of all the Goa'uld.
0,62,11,DANIEL,"But Apophis also doesnt know where Ammonet hid him, which is why they were searching Chu'lak."
0,62,11,BRA'TAC (TO DANIEL),Do you know where this child is?
0,62,11,DANIEL,Ah...all I know is that its a place called Kehb.
0,62,12,TEAL'C,You have heard of such a place?
0,62,12,BRA'TAC,It is an ancient legend. I did not believe it really existed.
0,62,12,DANIEL,It has to.
0,62,12,BRA'TAC,"The Goa'uld fear and despise Kehb. They forbade anyone of speaking of it long ago. It is something my father once spoke of to me. An old tale, about a place discovered long ago by a few Jaffa, and kept secret from the Goauld. When they could no longer carry a Primta, they would make their journey to Kehb. There the Ko'lak would learn the path through the darkness, into the next life."
0,62,12,DANIEL,"Ko'lak, that means soul, right?"
0,62,12,TEAL'C,Yes.
0,62,12,BRA'TAC,"When some of the Goa'uld finally found out about Kehb, they made their way there, they did not return, it was forbidden to speak of ever again. My father enjoyed telling me this. If the Goa'uld are truly all-powerful gods, he would say, how is it that they fear anything?"
0,62,12,DANIEL,"Well, it sounds like the perfect place to hide someone you dont want the Goa'uld to find...I dont suppose you happen to know the Stargate address?"
0,62,13,DANIEL,"Well all I have is some obscure earth mythology, which indicates that Osiris once hid there from Seth."
0,62,13,BRA'TAC,That story is told among Jaffa. Is that Osiris hid on one of the planets of the Lacnako?
0,62,13,DANIEL,Whats that?
0,62,13,TEAL'C,A group of planets thats resources have been depleted by mining.
0,62,13,DANIEL,"Well, I dont suppose you know any of the addresses of any of those planets?"
0,62,14,BRA'TAC,There. . Those are the planets of the Lac'na'ko.
0,62,14,DANIEL,Whats the red one?
0,62,14,SAM,"We basically have two reference maps for Stargate addresses. Yellow represents the cartouche that the Goa'uld left on Abydos, and the addresses from the Ancients original map of the Stargates is in red. You dont recognise this address right here?"
0,62,14,BRA'TAC,No.
0,62,14,DANIEL,If the legend is true the Goa'uld never would have included Kehb on their cartouche.
0,62,14,SAM,Well this address is the only planet in the system that the Goa'uld didnt included on their map.
0,62,14,DANIEL,We've found it.
0,62,15,HAMMOND,How do we know for sure this is Kehb?
0,62,15,BRA'TAC,"The story I have heard says Kehb is an untouched wilderness with great mountains, with a single temple in a valley distant from the Stargate."
0,62,15,DANIEL,If the Goa'uld are scared of Kehb that would explain why they have never mined this planet.
0,62,15,TEAL'C,"If Ammonet thought to hide the Harsesis on Kehb, then Apophis would presume so."
0,62,15,JACK,"Well scary stories or not Apophis is just nuts enough to go, Id like some back up on this one Sir."
0,62,15,HAMMOND,
0,62,15,BRA'TAC,As will I.
0,62,15,DANIEL,Lets just hope we're first.
0,62,17,MAJOR COBURN,Yes sir.
0,62,17,JACK,Hold down the fort Major.
0,62,17,MAHOR COBURN,Yes sir.
0,62,18,LATER,Teal'c and Bra'tac are studying some footprints on the ground.
0,62,18,JACK,What ya got?
0,62,18,TEAL'C,A group of Jaffa passed through here recently. Six.
0,62,18,BRA'TAC,Eight.
0,62,18,JACK,"So, not the first."
0,62,19,TEAL'C,You have been unusually silent Master Bra'tac.
0,62,19,BRA'TAC,There is not much time left before I can no longer carry a Primta.
0,62,19,TEAL'C,"When that time comes, I will have to decide what to do."
0,62,19,BRA'TAC,"If this truly is Kehb, that time may be upon is both."
0,62,20,JACK,What is it?
0,62,20,TEAL'C,Six of the Jaffa stopped here.
0,62,20,BRA'TAC,Two went on ahead. They returned with another. A woman.
0,62,20,JACK,How do ya know that?
0,62,21,BRA'TAC,"When they all met up again there was a struggle. Then they headed into the forest. Each print is spread wide, they were running."
0,62,21,JACK,Hes good.
0,62,21,TEAL'C,Extremely.
0,62,21,BRA'TAC,The woman may be the priestess entrusted with the child.
0,62,23,DANIEL,Smell that?
0,62,23,SAM,Yeah.
0,62,24,JACK,Carter?
0,62,24,SAM,"Its ok sir, its just a bird."
0,62,24,DANIEL,"No, look."
0,62,25,JACK,Or maybe some kind of...
0,62,25,TEAL'C,I have never before seen a weapon that could do such a thing.
0,62,25,JACK,Weapon.
0,62,25,BRA'TAC,Over here.
0,62,26,BRATAC,She was shot in the back as she fled.
0,62,26,DANIEL,I counted eight bodies...total.
0,62,26,JACK,"So, what happened here?"
0,62,26,BRATAC,"The priestess was being escorted back to the Stargate by two of the Jaffa. When they met the others she realised she was in danger. She attempted to flee. They chased her and shot her, then someone or something attacked them."
0,62,26,SAM,You cant know that for sure.
0,62,26,BRATAC,I am quite certain.
0,62,26,DANIEL,What about the child?
0,62,26,BRATAC,She carried the child.
0,62,26,JACK,Come on. How can you know that?
0,62,26,TEALC,Her hands are not bound.
0,62,26,BRATAC,"Yes, and they shot low."
0,62,26,DANIEL,And what happened to the boy?
0,62,26,BRATAC,That I cannot guess.
0,62,27,BRATAC,"The priestess died more than two days ago. When his Jaffa did not return the Harsesis, Apophis should have sent more."
0,62,27,TEALC,Perhaps many more.
0,62,27,JACK,Kehb?
0,62,27,BRATAC,Kehb.
0,62,29,SAM,No welcoming party.
0,62,29,JACK,"Well, someones been reading Martha Stewart."
0,62,29,DANIEL,Probably inside
0,62,29,JACK,Daniel?
0,62,29,DANIEL,Jack?
0,62,29,JACK,What ya doin?
0,62,29,DANIEL,"Well, something about this place tells me we shouldnt ruch in there guns a blazin."
0,62,29,BRATAC,Hes right. This is sacred ground.
0,62,29,JACK,I-sh. Wait here.
0,62,29,BRATAC,I have dreamed of finding this place twice as long as you have been alive. I will accompany you.
0,62,30,JACK,Hey! Woah!
0,62,31,JACK,Whered you come from?
0,62,31,MONK,I have been here for some time.
0,62,31,JACK,"No, you werent here when we just came in."
0,62,31,MONK,Here is everywhere you are.
0,62,31,JACK,Excuse me?
0,62,31,DANIEL,"Um, hello. Im Daniel Jackson and this is Jack ONeill. And this is Bratac, were peaceful explorers from a place called earth."
0,62,31,MONK,Do you seek oneness with the Sala?
0,62,31,DANIEL,"The Sala, I know that word. It sounds tribal, African maybe."
0,62,31,MONK,"The Sala is everything, everywhere."
0,62,31,DANIEL,"Nature. It means, nature."
0,62,31,JACK,Ah.
0,62,31,MONK,Put no barriers between you and where you are.
0,62,31,JACK,Dont look at me.
0,62,31,BRATAC,I believe he wishes us to take off our boots.
0,62,31,JACK,Yeah...look ah...weve been walking a ways today...
0,62,31,MONK,Your journey has begun.
0,62,31,JACK,Yeah. Im just saying I think Im doin us all a big favour by keeping these babies on.
0,62,31,MONK,"When the mind is opened, the spirit is freed and the body matters not."
0,62,32,JACK,Heres an idea. Why dont we just ask the man if the boys here?
0,62,33,DANIEL (TO MONK),Weve come looking for a boy. A baby.
0,62,33,MONK,"Lightening flashed, sparks shower, in one blink of your eyes you have mis-seen."
0,62,33,JACK,"Lightening, you say?"
0,62,33,MONK,I only know a snowflake cannot exist in a storm of fire.
0,62,33,JACK,What?!
0,62,33,DANIEL,Jack...
0,62,34,DANIEL,"Sorry...ah, dont worry about him."
0,62,34,MONK,"The sun is warm, wind is wild, grass is green along the shores, here no bull can hide."
0,62,34,JACK,"Oh, I dunno about that."
0,62,34,DANIEL,"Jack, hes speaking in his in cones. Whatever theology he follows maybe an original basis for Buddhism on earth."
0,62,34,JACK,"Well thats very nice. Ill be sure to call the Deli Lama when I get home. But for now, how about why we came here?"
0,62,34,DANIEL,"Um, hes right, this is very important. Is there a child here?"
0,62,34,MONK,There is a child in all of us.
0,62,34,JACK,Oh come on.
0,62,34,BRATAC,"He seeks a real human boy, of flesh and bones."
0,62,34,MONK,Those who seek oneness are all that they seek.
0,62,34,DANIEL,I think this is gonna take a while.
0,62,34,JACK,Really? What gives ya that idea?
0,62,36,SAM,Everything OK?
0,62,36,TEALC,It is nothing. I do not have a good feeling about this place.
0,62,37,TEALC,What about the Harsesis child ONeill?
0,62,37,JACK,I dunno. Theres a monk guy in there. Daniel thinks he might know something so hes gonna play along.
0,62,37,SAM,Play along?
0,62,37,JACK,Somethin about...enlightenment.
0,62,37,SAM,Sir...
0,62,37,JACK,I know...I know.
0,62,38,MONK (TO BRATAC),Within you is a being whose heart knows only darkness.
0,62,38,BRATAC,Yes.
0,62,38,MONK,You must renounce such evil to achieve oneness with Oma Desala.
0,62,38,DANIEL,Oma...what does that mean?
0,62,38,MONK,"Words cannot express things...speech cannot convey the spirit, swayed by words one is lost. One cannot carry darkness on the great path."
0,62,38,BRATAC,"If I remove the symbiote within me, I would die."
0,62,38,MONK,You cannot start the journey with it inside you.
0,62,38,BRATAC,So a Jaffa cannot seek oneness before he is willing to die.
0,62,38,MONK,"When the mind is freed, the body is no longer required. I sense you are not ready to meet Oma Desala."
0,62,38,BRATAC,I am not ready to die. But I take solace in the fact that journey is ahead of me.
0,62,39,DANIEL,"So, ah, I dont have to die right?"
0,62,39,MONK,You do not have the same evil within you.
0,62,39,DANIEL,Good.
0,62,39,MONK,But you have your own burdens of which to rid yourself.
0,62,39,OK.,
0,62,40,BRATAC,"I am not yet ready to give up. I feel alive Tealc, like a young man of 80. We still have false gods to slay."
0,62,41,MONK,"She goes into the lake without making a ripple, she goes into the forest without disturbing a blade of grass."
0,62,41,DANIEL,Who is she?
0,62,41,MONK,The mother.
0,62,41,DANIEL,De Sala. Nature. Mother nature. Were talking about Mother Nature.
0,62,41,MONK,Why do you seek this child of flesh and bones?
0,62,41,DANIEL,Hes the son of my wife.
0,62,41,MONK,But not your son.
0,62,41,DANIEL,"No. But my wife is dead now, and I promised her I would make sure the boy is safe."
0,62,41,MONK,And you are sure he will be safe with you?
0,62,41,DANIEL,Yes. Absolutely.
0,62,41,MONK,"Because it is so clear, it takes a longer time to realise it. If you immediately know the candlelight is fire, then the meal was cooked a long time ago."
0,62,41,DANIEL,"Right, well, I err...I have no idea what your talking about."
0,62,42,DANIEL,I cant do it.
0,62,42,MONK,You say you seek this child to fulfil a promise.
0,62,42,DANIEL,Yes.
0,62,42,MONK,Is there another reason?
0,62,42,DANIEL,"The child has knowledge. He can help my people defend themselves against an evil enemy, the Goauld."
0,62,42,MONK,You hate the Goauld?
0,62,42,DANIEL,The Goauld are responsible for the death of my wife. Among millions and millions of other people. How can I not hate them?
0,62,42,MONK,Your hate will lead to the childs death.
0,62,42,DANIEL,How do you know that?
0,62,42,MONK,You must trust. You must believe.
0,62,42,DANIEL,"Well maybe what I dont believe is that I can light a candle with my mind. You see I find it much easier to use a lighter or a match, its much more practical..."
0,62,43,DANIEL,Wow.
0,62,43,MONK,Now you blow it out.
0,62,44,DANIEL,"Oh...sorry. Could you, could you light that again?"
0,62,45,DANEIL,This isnt like a trick candle or anything is it?
0,62,45,MONK,Put your hand in the flame.
0,62,45,DANIEL,What?
0,62,45,MONK,Place your hand in the flame.
0,62,46,DANIEL,Ah! Why did you tell me to do that?
0,62,46,MONK,Why did you do it?
0,62,46,DANIEL,Because you told me to.
0,62,46,MONK,Because you trusted?
0,62,46,DANIEL,Yes.
0,62,46,MONK,"Within you is the capacity for trust. Trust Oma Desala. Do not believe you can light the candle, believe she can."
0,62,47,JACK,Times up.
0,62,48,DANIEL,"Jack, the markings on the wall are a language. Its a bible. Ah...no. Actually its more like an instruction book on how to reach this ethereal plane of existence, some kind of other world. Its only natural that the Jaffa who found this place would have interpreted it as a passage to the after life..."
0,62,48,JACK,Woah...slow down there grasshopper.
0,62,48,DANIEL,"Ok, Im pretty sure that this place was built by an alien race, millennia ago. They may have even visited earth and inspired the mythologys, the concept of Mother Nature, in various cultures."
0,62,48,JACK,
0,62,48,DANIEL,"No. Um, I pretty sure the aliens discovered a means by which they could ascend to some higher plane of existence, and went there, wherever there is. But they left the writings and the shrine as a kind of map for others who wanted to follow them. The monk has taken up some sort of curator-ship."
0,62,48,JACK,Kind of a janitor?
0,62,48,DANIEL,More of a guide.
0,62,48,JACK,An usher?
0,62,48,DANIEL,"It doesnt matter, just watch."
0,62,49,JACK,Am I supposed to believe you did that?
0,62,49,DANIEL,Yes.
0,62,49,JACK,Daniel...a word?
0,62,50,JACK,We didnt come here to learn parlour tricks.
0,62,50,DANIEL,Jack...
0,62,50,JACK,Is the boy here or not?
0,62,50,DANIEL,I think so.
0,62,50,JACK,"Cause every minute we stay here, were risking our necks."
0,62,50,DANIEL,I know that...
0,62,50,JACK,"So please understand Im on the verge of ordering a complete search of this place, with or without his co-operation..."
0,62,50,DANIEL,You cant do that.
0,62,50,JACK,"Your confused Daniel, I can. So far I havent."
0,62,50,DANIEL,I am gaining his trust.
0,62,50,JACK,And how long is something like that gonna take?
0,62,50,DANIEL,Jack you dont understand.
0,62,50,JACK,I think I do.
0,62,51,JACK (TO MONK),"Hey, hey hey hey. All right, thats dangerous. Put it down."
0,62,52,JACK,
0,62,52,DANIEL,"Actually, I did that."
0,62,52,JACK,What?
0,62,52,DANIEL,"Thats what Ive been trying to tell you. This, its, its incredible."
0,62,52,JACK,He taught you how to...
0,62,52,DANIEL,Do things with my mind. You could do it too.
0,62,52,JACK,He could teach me how to light candles and move stuff around by...thinking.
0,62,52,MONK,I cannot teach you what you already know.
0,62,52,JACK,"Oh, I dont think I know as much as you think I know."
0,62,52,MONK,You must come to know Oma Desala. Become her friend.
0,62,53,JACK,That your friend?
0,62,54,JACK,"Tealc, Bratac, you wanna check that out? Major Coburn, this is ONeill."
0,62,54,COBURN,Read you sir.
0,62,54,JACK,Weve got some Jaffa activity here. Hows your position?
0,62,54,COBURN,Clear sir.
0,62,54,JACK,Good. Stand by. I want claymores from the entrance to here.
0,62,54,SAM,I thought we were leaving?
0,62,55,JACK,"So, is the kid here or not?"
0,62,55,DANIEL,Jack...
0,62,55,JACK,"Daniel, that was a glider. Were out of time."
0,62,55,MONK,Time means nothing to the...
0,62,55,JACK,Ah ah! Dont say it.
0,62,56,SAM,Claymores are set sir.
0,62,56,JACK,Good. Daniel thinks we should stay.
0,62,56,SAM,Why?
0,62,56,JACK,"Well, watch."
0,62,56,SAM,What?
0,62,57,SAM,You did that?
0,62,57,DANIEL,Yes.
0,62,57,SAM,Thats impossible.
0,62,57,JACK,Youd think.
0,62,57,DANIEL,Why?
0,62,57,SAM,You learned the power to control fire?
0,62,57,DANIEL,"Its not just fire. All the instructions are here, on the walls. All you have to do is be willing to learn and believe."
0,62,57,SAM,"Im sorry, but something else has to be going on here."
0,62,57,DANIEL,Why?
0,62,57,SAM,"I dont know, but under different circumstances I would bring in the right equipment and check for some kind of concealed technology before I assumed that..."
0,62,57,DANIEL,Isnt there the smallest part of you that wants to believe a person can reach a higher level?
0,62,57,SAM,"Yes, of course, but..."
0,62,57,DANIEL,Dont you see whats happening here? I have that power.
0,62,57,SAM,To do what?
0,62,57,DANIEL,To protect the child. I think she doesnt want me to leave until she knows I understand how to protect him.
0,62,58,TEALC,A Goauld mother ship has landed. As many as 2000 troups approach.
0,62,58,JACK,Love to stay and chat...
0,62,58,DANIEL,"Wait, wait a minute, what about..."
0,62,60,JACK,Doh.
0,62,63,JACK,Wheres Daniel?
0,62,64,JACK,"Daniel?! Daniel, we gotta go! Oh for crying out loud."
0,62,65,JACK,"I dunno where he is, hes not in there."
0,62,65,SAM,What do we do?
0,62,65,JACK,Coburn? ONeill.
0,62,65,COBURN,Read you sir.
0,62,65,JACK,High tail it back through the gate. Tell Hammond were pinned down. Request back up.
0,62,65,COBURN=,Yes sir.
0,62,66,JACK,"Lots of back up. All right, here they come. Defensive positions. Hold off on the claymores as long as we can. I dont wanna get into this unless we absolutely have to. And if we happen to make it out of this in one piece, remind me to harm Daniel, severely."
0,62,68,DANIEL,Thank you. Hell be safe with me.
0,62,69,DANIEL,"I didnt do any of it did I? It was you. I was wrong. I dont, I dont have any powers at all. You do. You were showing them to me. Thats how you communicate with us. You were trying to tell me the boys better off here with you, and I wasnt listening. I made a promise."
0,62,70,DANIEL,I promised he would be safe.
0,62,72,JAFFA,Lo comal. Asep.
0,62,72,MONK,You are not welcome here.
0,62,72,JAFFA,"In the name of the god Apophis, we have come for a young boy."
0,62,72,MONK,You will leave now.
0,62,72,JAFFA,We will not. Stand aside.
0,62,73,DANIEL,No!
0,62,73,JACK (STANDS),Drop your weapons! Do it!
0,62,73,JAFFA,Crie Loshak.
0,62,73,DANIEL,Drop your weapons.
0,62,73,JACK,You heard him!
0,62,73,DANIEL,I was talking to you Jack.
0,62,73,JACK,What?
0,62,73,DANIEL,"Do it now, all of you."
0,62,73,JACK,Daniel?!
0,62,73,DANIEL,"Jack I was wrong, very wrong. One of those aliens I thought was long gone is still here."
0,62,73,SAM,"Sir, we put our guns down and were dead."
0,62,73,JAFFA,You are outnumbered and surrounded. You will die if you do not.
0,62,73,DANIEL,"Jack if your ever gonna trust me on anything now is the time. The alien is the one with all the powers and she is not someone you wanna fool with, if you get my drift."
0,62,73,BRATAC,You must do it.
0,62,74,JAFFA,Kill them.
0,62,75,DANIEL,Bye.
0,62,76,JACK,Well that was cool. Wow.
0,62,77,DANIEL,Youre leaving? You know that more of them will come as long as they know the boy is here? . Ill see both of you again someday right?
0,62,78,SAM,I take it that was the Harsesis child she was holding?
0,62,78,DANIEL,Yeah.

0,62,78,COBURN,Good to hear sir.
0,62,79,COBURN,"Ah sir, the Stargate just came on. Theres a strange bright light headed this way."
0,62,79,JACK,"Do not engage, repeat get out of the way and do not engage, in fact Im ordering you all to put down your weapons until that light is gone, do you read?"
0,62,79,COBURN,Yes sir.
