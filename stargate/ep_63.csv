0,63,0,"""CRYSTAL SKULL""","By Brad Wright We see an enormous pyramid and the MALP travels along a walkway towards it. Meanwhile, Jack, Sam, Daniel and Teal'c are in the control room watching the video playback."
0,63,0,CARTER,This is well over a thousand metres high.
0,63,0,O'NEILL,"And as pyramids go, that's.... big?"
0,63,0,TEAL'C,I know of no goa'uld structure of that magnitude.
0,63,0,DANIEL,Definitely Mayan. This is a major find; I have to see this.
0,63,0,O'NEILL,Any signs of life there?
0,63,0,CARTER,There is a breathable atmosphere Sir but no complex life signs.
0,63,1,CARTER,This *is* a major find. *I* have to see this.
0,63,1,O'NEILL,You too?
0,63,1,CARTER,"Well look at these readings. Sir, these are leptons."
0,63,1,O'NEILL,Get out.
0,63,1,CARTER,Well that means something inside this pyramid is slowing down neutrinos. Normally neutrinos pass right through ordinary matter no matter how dense. I mean something like 500 million billion just passed through you
0,63,1,O'NEILL,No matter how dense?
0,63,1,CARTER,"A material that slows neutrinos could change everything we know about physics, the formation of the universe."
0,63,1,DANIEL,"Wait a minute Sam. Get, ah get closer."
0,63,1,CARTER,"I can't, the MALP's too big to cross the span."
0,63,1,DANIEL,Then zoom in. On that.
0,63,1,TEAL'C,It appears to be a human skull.
0,63,1,DANIEL,No that's a crystal skull.
0,63,1,CARTER,How do you know?
0,63,1,DANIEL,Because it's exactly like the one found in 1971 in Belize. By my grandfather.
0,63,4,DANIEL,I could name at least a dozen different crystal skulls from various parts of the world but the skull that Nick discovered in Belize was unique.
0,63,4,O'NEILL,Nick?
0,63,4,DANIEL,"Ah yeah. The, ah, great explorer. The not so great grandfather Nicholas Ballard. He preferred being called Nick, even when I was a kid. It was. anyway ah the point is that no one can explain how the skull Nick discovered was carved, from a single piece of crystal, against the grain, given the technology of the day. He claimed that it possessed a certain power."
0,63,4,HAMMOND,What kind of power?
0,63,4,DANIEL,"That if one were to look into the eyes of the skull, one would be teleported to see aliens."
0,63,4,TEAL'C,Your grandfather saw these aliens.
0,63,4,DANIEL,So he insisted to the entire academic community.
0,63,4,FRAISER,I take it his claim didn't go over very well?
0,63,4,DANIEL,"As you might imagine, no. He tried for years under controlled conditions to make the skull teleport him again but he never could."
0,63,4,O'NEILL,Doesn't mean he wasn't right.
0,63,4,CARTER,The academic community didn't believe your theory that the pyramids were landing sites for alien space ships either
0,63,4,O'NEILL,We have to see this.
0,63,4,HAMMOND,I'll authorise a standard recon mission.
0,63,4,FRAISER,"Colonel, I can only guess at the effect this type of radiation may have on the human body. I recommend limited exposure, ten, fifteen minutes at most."
0,63,4,DANIEL,"Wait a minute, that's not enough time. I mean there has to be some sort of radiation suit or."
0,63,4,O'NEILL,Hey! If you'd been listening you know that nintendos pass through everything.
0,63,4,DANIEL,I heard.
0,63,4,O'NEILL,Everything.
0,63,5,O'NEILL,Whoa!
0,63,5,CARTER,Muon radiation is increasing.
0,63,5,O'NEILL,Unhealthy?
0,63,5,CARTER,"I don't think so Sir, not if it stays at these levels."
0,63,5,TEAL'C,"Whoever the builders are, they would appear to be a formidable race."
0,63,5,DANIEL,You could fit every pyramid on earth inside this thing and still have room to spare.
0,63,5,O'NEILL,Could you imagine heating this place?
0,63,6,O'NEILL,Major. Start the clock.
0,63,7,DANIEL,It's identical to the one Nick discovered in Belize.
0,63,7,TEAL'C,"Can you determine if it is a means of transport, as your grandfather believed?"
0,63,7,DANIEL,"Ahh, I can't be sure, there's no writings of any kind on the pedestal."
0,63,7,CARTER,This cavern must act like some sort of containment bottle.
0,63,7,DANIEL,It's no wonder Nick was so fascinated by.
0,63,7,CARTER,"If I can get a sample of the substance that's slowing down these neutrinos, we can change the face of physics."
0,63,7,DANIEL,"It's like a living thing, it's."
0,63,7,O'NEILL,Wonder how far down that is?
0,63,8,TEAL'C,Daniel Jackson!
0,63,8,CARTER,"Sir, radiation is spiking. It's at 300%."
0,63,8,O'NEILL,What?
0,63,8,400.,
0,63,8,O'NEILL,"All right, that's it. We're out of here. Daniel?"
0,63,9,O'NEILL,Where'd he go?
0,63,10,TEAL'C,He seemed to disappear.
0,63,10,CARTER,"Sir these readings are off the scale now. If we don't leave here soon, we're."
0,63,11,O'NEILL,"Teal'c, get outta there!"
0,63,12,TECH,Incoming traveller Sir. It's SG1.
0,63,12,HAMMOND,Open the iris.
0,63,14,HAMMOND,Get a medical team in here. Where's Doctor Jackson?
0,63,16,FRAISER,He's coming to Sir.
0,63,16,O'NEILL,Carter? Daniel?
0,63,16,FRAISER,"She's still unconscious. Teal'c is better off than both of you, his symbiote is helping him. It was close Colonel, if you hadn't left when you did.."
0,63,16,O'NEILL,Hot.
0,63,16,FRAISER,"Yes, I know. We're trying to keep your temperature down. The muon radiation affected your hypothalamus. Essentially your internal thermostat went haywire. Your respiration, heartbeat and your temperature have been fluctuating wildly."
0,63,16,O'NEILL,No kidding.
0,63,16,HAMMOND,"As for Doctor Jackson, Colonel, he never returned with you."
0,63,16,TEAL'C,He is no longer there General Hammond. The skull enveloped him in an energy field. I fired my zatnikatel but it was too late. He seemed to disappear.
0,63,16,HAMMOND,What?
0,63,19,HAMMOND,Pan the camera left again. Do the infra red sensors detect any sign of Doctor Jackson?
0,63,19,TECH,No Sir.
0,63,20,HAMMOND,You should be in the infirmary.
0,63,20,TEAL'C,I am well again General Hammond.
0,63,20,HAMMOND,Not according to Doctor Fraiser.
0,63,20,TEAL'C,Nicholas Ballard believed the crystal skull to be a teleportation device. Recovering the skull may help us to determine the location to which he was teleported.
0,63,20,HAMMOND,The MALP telemetry suggests the radiation levels are still too high.
0,63,20,TEAL'C,My symbiote provides me with a greater tolerance against the effects of radiation.
0,63,20,HAMMOND,And if that thing zaps you to wherever it sent Doctor Jackson?
0,63,20,TEAL'C,Then I will have succeeded in locating him.
0,63,21,DANIEL,Teal'c! What happened? Where is everybody? You just ran right through me. TEAL'C! What the hell is going on?
0,63,23,DANIEL,Hey!
0,63,23,HAMMOND,Well done Teal'c.
0,63,23,TEAL'C,Regrettably there was no sign of Daniel Jackson.
0,63,23,DANIEL,So I take it nobody else can see me either?
0,63,23,HAMMOND,Doctor Rothman is awaiting the artifact in Lab 3c.
0,63,23,SILER,Yes Sir.
0,63,23,TEAL'C,Major Carter will also want to study it.
0,63,23,HAMMOND,As soon as she's fully recovered.
0,63,23,DANIEL,Recovered from what? What happened?
0,63,25,FRAISER,She's gonna be fine Teal'c. They're exposure wasn't long enough to cause any permanent damage.
0,63,25,DOC!,
0,63,25,FRAISER,You can protest all you want Colonel but it will be a while till you get your strength back. So relax. Ah. Doctors orders.
0,63,26,O'NEILL,Napoleonic power monger. News?
0,63,26,TEAL'C,Daniel Jackson was nowhere in the vicinity of the pyramid.
0,63,26,O'NEILL,What the hell happened to him?
0,63,26,TEAL'C,I do not believe the skull is a weapon O'Neill.
0,63,26,DANIEL,"Well you're right about that, it's not a weapon."
0,63,26,TEAL'C,It is indeed a teleportation device. I believe the artifact itself .
0,63,26,DANIEL,No something else happened.
0,63,26,TEAL'C,Doctor Rothman is now studying it.
0,63,26,O'NEILL,Rothman couldn't figure out an ashtray. The guy we need working on that skull is Daniel.
0,63,26,TEAL'C,"It is he whom we endeavor to locate, O'Neill."
0,63,26,O'NEILL,Look I'm sick of laying around. Help me up.
0,63,26,TEAL'C,Doctor Fraiser believes you are not strong enough to undertake such a mission. Doctor Fraiser is usually correct in such matters.
0,63,26,O'NEILL,Thank you.
0,63,26,TEAL'C,You are welcome O'Neill.
0,63,27,DANIEL,"Okay, you can do this Robert, I know you can. Focus on the Mayan legends. The lost pyramids of Belize. The Ballard skull. That's where the answer is."
0,63,27,ROTHMAN,"Well, it's a crystal skull."
0,63,27,HAMMOND,We knew that Doctor.
0,63,27,ROTHMAN,It's almost identical to the Nicholas Ballard skull in the Smithsonian.
0,63,27,DANIEL,He doesn't know it was found on P7X
0,63,27,ROTHMAN,"Actually the craftsmanship is very impressive. It's probably made in Germany, early 1900's. What I don't understand is what it has to do with Daniel being missing."
0,63,27,TEAL'C,We believe it to be a teleportation device.
0,63,27,ROTHMAN,Are you serious?
0,63,27,DANIEL,That's good Robert. Be skeptical.
0,63,27,HAMMOND,We were hoping your archaeological expertise could help provide insight into where he may have been sent.
0,63,27,ROTHMAN,It's a skull.
0,63,27,DANIEL,Not that skeptical.
0,63,27,TEAL'C,I myself witnessed the artifact create a tremendous field of energy that engulfed Daniel Jackson.
0,63,27,ROTHMAN,It's made of crystal not plutonium. I don't see how this could..
0,63,27,HAMMOND,Humor me Doctor. I want a full report within 12 hours.
0,63,27,ROTHMAN,"Yes Sir, I was just."
0,63,27,TEAL'C,Do not look directly into its eyes.
0,63,27,ROTHMAN,Okay.
0,63,27,DANIEL,Don't let me down Robert.
0,63,27,ROTHMAN,Teleportation device? I. What do you think?
0,63,27,SILER,I think you're gonna get fired.
0,63,29,DANIEL,"Teal'c. In case I don't ever get the chance to say this. If you hadn't have come back for me, I might have been stuck in that place forever. Thank you."
0,63,30,TEAL'C,Is there someone present?
0,63,30,DANIEL,"Yes. It's me. It's Daniel. I'm right here. I'm right here. Just don' t walk...through me. It's very disconcerting. You sensed I was in the room, you just can't see or hear me which is a little frustrating as you may imagine."
0,63,32,CARTER,
0,63,32,DANIEL,That's what I've been trying to tell him.
0,63,32,ROTHMAN,I know that. I was trying to prove something.
0,63,32,FRAISER,Prove what?
0,63,32,DANIEL,That the skull didn't do this.
0,63,32,CARTER,"You don't think the skull is responsible for what happened to Daniel, do you?"
0,63,32,ROTHMAN,I'm still here.
0,63,32,CARTER,There was intense muon radiation at the time the energy..
0,63,32,ROTHMAN,There's no residual radiation..
0,63,32,CARTER,Look I saw what that thing is capable of.
0,63,32,ROTHMAN,"Hey. I wish it was a teleportation device. I could use it to go find Daniel. He's my friend too you know. I don't think that's what we've got here. I think what we've got here is a paperweight. I'm sorry, that's my opinion."
0,63,32,CARTER,"It's all right, I'll take over from here. There may be properties in the crystalline structure that are invisible to the naked eye. We should run some diagnostic tests."
0,63,33,DANIEL,"Wait a minute, I'm not hungry or thirsty. Why not?"
0,63,33,CARTER,Thank you.
0,63,33,DANIEL,Because I'm dead.
0,63,34,ROTHMAN,What?
0,63,34,CARTER,Did anybody else feel that?
0,63,34,FRAISER,What?
0,63,34,DANIEL,What if I'm a ghost?
0,63,34,CARTER,I just got a shiver.
0,63,34,FRAISER,You're still feeling the after effects of the radiation.
0,63,34,DANIEL,No I think that was me.
0,63,36,TECH,Chevron 4 encoded.
0,63,36,CARTER,"Sir, we've subjected the skull to every piece of diagnostic equipment we have."
0,63,36,TECH,Chevron 5 encoded.
0,63,36,HAMMOND,What have you found out?
0,63,36,CARTER,Nothing.
0,63,36,O'NEILL,We could take another look at that planet Sir.
0,63,36,FRAISER,I'd strongly recommend against it. We're still getting periodic readings from the MALP. The radiation levels have dropped slightly but they're still elevated.
0,63,36,TECH,Chevron 6 encoded.
0,63,36,HAMMOND,We're preparing a UAV for a long-range search around the pyramid. I don't see any point in risking another SG team unless that search turns up something.
0,63,36,TECH,Chevron 7 locked.
0,63,36,HAMMOND,Launch when ready Sergeant.
0,63,36,TECH,"Launching UAV in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 mark."
0,63,36,CARTER,I can't believe I'm gonna suggest this but what about Daniel's grandfather?
0,63,36,O'NEILL/DANIEL,Nick?
0,63,36,CARTER,He claimed that the skull teleported him somewhere. Maybe he's the only person who actually knows where Daniel is?
0,63,36,FRAISER,I'm not so sure Major. I've already taken the liberty of looking him up.
0,63,36,DANIEL,Oh you didn't.
0,63,36,FRAISER,His current address is a psychiatric institution in Oregon.
0,63,36,O'NEILL,Psychiatric?
0,63,36,FRAISER,Apparently his failure to prove the crystal skull was more than just a curiosity caused a severe mental breakdown from which he's never recovered. Nick checked himself in.
0,63,36,CARTER,Why wouldn't Daniel have told us that?
0,63,36,DANIEL,"Oh yes, by the way, he's insane."
0,63,36,FRAISER,"Daniel was a regular visitor there up until 4 years ago, right before he joined the Stargate program."
0,63,36,DANIEL,"Oh please, he kicked me out, we had a huge fight."
0,63,36,FRAISER,Apparently Nick still talks about him all the time.
0,63,36,DANIEL,He doesn't want anything to do with me.
0,63,36,FRAISER,The doctor I spoke to says any friends of Doctor Jackson's are welcome.
0,63,36,DANIEL,What?
0,63,36,CARTER,We don't have much else to go on.
0,63,36,HAMMOND,Find out what you can but I needn't remind you that the details of this matter will have to remain classified. That means you won't be able to tell him what happened to Doctor Jackson or where the skull was found.
0,63,37,NURSE,Sorry for the wait. Is there anything I can do for you?
0,63,37,TEAL'C,You may take us to Nicholas Ballard immediately.
0,63,37,O'NEILL,He's just a little anxious to see ol' Nick.
0,63,37,NURSE,"Oh, are you close?"
0,63,37,TEAL'C/DANIEL,No.
0,63,37,CARTER/O'NEILL,Yes.
0,63,37,TEAL'C,"Yes, extremely."
0,63,37,NURSE,"Well, I'll just check and see if he's ready for you."
0,63,37,DANIEL,What am I waiting for?
0,63,37,NURSE,Colonel O'Neill and his party are here.
0,63,37,DOCTOR,Friends of Daniel I told you about are here just outside. Would you like to see them now?
0,63,37,NICK,I miss him.
0,63,37,DANIEL,"Hi Nick, long time no see."
0,63,37,DOCTOR,Would you show them in please?
0,63,37,DANIEL,"Nick, I need your help. Friends of mine want to ask you about the skull you found in Belize. Tell them everything, trust them."
0,63,38,DOCTOR,"Nick, this is Colonel Jack O'Neill. He's a friend of Daniel's."
0,63,38,O'NEILL,Doctor would you mind if we.
0,63,38,NICK,Nick.
0,63,38,O'NEILL,Jack. O'Neill. Colonel.
0,63,38,NICK,Daniel followed my footsteps.
0,63,38,O'NEILL,You must be very proud.
0,63,38,NICK,He made a fool of himself.
0,63,38,DANIEL,Oh here we go.
0,63,38,NICK,He staked his entire academic career on this belief that that the great pyramids of Egypt were made by aliens.
0,63,38,O'NEILL,"Yes, well that's."
0,63,38,NICK,He was more insane than I was. I told him to forget all that nonsense.
0,63,38,DANIEL,"It wasn't nonsense, I was right."
0,63,38,NICK,"He lost his apartment, his research grant. He hasn't published a paper in two years. Now where is he? Where is he now?"
0,63,38,CARTER,In a way that's what this is all about. We wanted to hear exactly what happened to you back in 71 when you first found the skull.
0,63,38,NICK,Nothing happened. There were no aliens.
0,63,38,DANIEL,Trust them Nick.
0,63,38,NICK,No one believed me.
0,63,38,O'NEILL,Daniel believed you.
0,63,38,DANIEL,Oh no. No no don't.
0,63,38,NICK,"He didn't. He wanted to, he did listen. In the end he did not believe in my theories of the skull just as I did not believe his theories of the pyramids and the aliens."
0,63,38,DANIEL,I guess we were both right.
0,63,38,O'NEILL,"Nick, can you tell us what happened when you found that skull?"
0,63,38,NICK,Why?
0,63,38,O'NEILL,Because we found another skull. Identical to the one you found in Belize.
0,63,38,NICK,Show me.
0,63,38,CARTER,It's in a high security facility at the moment. But if you tell us about your experiences..
0,63,38,NICK,Then take me there.
0,63,38,O'NEILL,We can't do that. It's classified.
0,63,38,DANIEL,You have to.
0,63,38,NICK,If you don't then I won't tell you anything. It is up to you.
0,63,41,HAMMOND,"Colonel, there is no greater secret in this nation than the Stargate."
0,63,41,O'NEILL,So we keep him away from Level 28.
0,63,41,HAMMOND,A civilian who's spent the last 20 years of his life in a psychiatric institution?
0,63,41,O'NEILL,"Exactly, who's gonna believe him if he says anything?"
0,63,41,HAMMOND,Colonel you walk a fine line.
0,63,41,O'NEILL,Thank you Sir.
0,63,42,HAMMOND,Hammond.
0,63,42,DANIEL,"General, I know you can't hear me but thank you."
0,63,42,HAMMOND,"Absolutely, put her through. Kayla, sweetheart, this is grandpa. Isn't this past your bedtime? You lost another tooth? Well you put it under your pilla tonight. I bet your big sister Tessa wishes she lost a tooth. I'd love to come and see you in your school play tomorrow night sweetheart. Well a very close friend of mine is lost and he needs my help. Yes he's a very close friend. I hope so too."
0,63,44,SILER,I don't think you should touch that sir.
0,63,44,CARTER,"It's all right Sergeant thank you. Nick, this is Doctor Robert Rothman."
0,63,44,ROTHMAN,It's a pleasure to meet you..
0,63,44,NICK,It's exactly the same as the one I found in Belize. Where did you find it?
0,63,44,O'NEILL,We can't tell you that
0,63,44,DANIEL,You're gonna have to tell him eventually Jack.
0,63,44,NICK,The skull stood on a stone pedestal. You have been there haven't you?
0,63,44,CARTER,You mean Belize?
0,63,44,NICK,"No, no, no, no. That was the ruins of the temple where I found the skull, all gone, collapsed. I am talking about a cavern."
0,63,44,TEAL'C,You know the location of this cavern?
0,63,44,NICK,Nowhere on this earth. It was so enormous that the light of my torch never reached the bottom.
0,63,44,DANIEL,"Yes, but how did you get there?"
0,63,44,NICK,"I don't know how I got there, a field of energy surrounded me and suddenly I was simply there. And then they came."
0,63,44,CARTER,They?
0,63,44,NICK,The giants.
0,63,44,CARTER,Giants?
0,63,44,NICK,The giant aliens. They rose up as if they were made of mist; they flew around me like spectres.
0,63,44,DANIEL,Now you know why no one believed him.
0,63,44,NICK,"They spoke, ""Oo ya wolin wolin we tayil."""
0,63,44,ROTHMAN,That's Mayan.
0,63,44,ROTHMAN/DANIEL,The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
0,63,44,DANIEL,But what does it mean?
0,63,44,NICK,"I was afraid to answer, I just closed my eyes and suddenly I found myself back again under the temple in Belize. The ground was shaking as in an earthquake and I just grabbed the skull and climbed out and everything collapsed."
0,63,44,O'NEILL,"Wow, that's erm. giants?"
0,63,44,CARTER,So you were sent to this cavern and back again without ever knowing where it was? And the ruins where you found the skull?
0,63,44,NICK,I spent years trying to find it again but it was as if the temple never existed.
0,63,44,CARTER,So I guess you couldn't take us there either?
0,63,44,NICK,Can you imagine what it feels like to go on the most incredible journey of your life and have no one believe you.
0,63,44,O'NEILL,"Ahh Teal'c, you wanna escort Nick down to the VIP room?"
0,63,44,TEAL'C,"Nicholas Ballard, would you come with me please."
0,63,44,O'NEILL,So tell you anything?
0,63,44,ROTHMAN,"Maybe, I mean, no."
0,63,44,O'NEILL,Work on it.
0,63,46,CARTER,"He described the cavern perfectly Sir, he had to have been there."
0,63,46,O'NEILL,Ahh giants?
0,63,46,DANIEL,"Yes that's weird, I admit."
0,63,46,CARTER,Somebody built that place.
0,63,46,O'NEILL,Doesn't help us.
0,63,46,DANIEL,But if he really was transported to P7X 377 maybe the skull was trying to send me somewhere and something interrupted the process.
0,63,47,CARTER,You get the feeling Daniel's still around?
0,63,47,DANIEL,We have to go back there.
0,63,47,O'NEILL,Kinda.
0,63,47,CARTER,I guess it's cos we miss him.
0,63,47,DANIEL,And we have to talk to those giant aliens.
0,63,47,O'NEILL,Or radiation sickness?
0,63,47,CARTER,Goodnight Sir.
0,63,48,DANIEL,What? That's it? Whatever happened to working through the night? I'd do it for you.
0,63,49,TEAL'C,There will be a guard posted outside your door should you require assistance.
0,63,49,NICK,When you see Daniel would you tell him. Never mind. It's something I should tell him myself.
0,63,49,TEAL'C,Very well.
0,63,50,NICK,I am sorry.
0,63,50,DANIEL,For what?
0,63,50,NICK,For not adopting you when your parents died.
0,63,50,DANIEL,You were traveling all over the world.
0,63,50,NICK,That wasn't your fault.
0,63,50,DANIEL,"I was 8 years old, how could it be my fault?"
0,63,50,NICK,I am sorry for allowing my obsession to drive me into madness. Would you forgive me?
0,63,50,DANIEL,You can see me?
0,63,50,NICK,"Yes, Daniel. I can see you."
0,63,50,DANIEL,Why didn't you say something?
0,63,50,NICK,You're not real so it doesn't mean anything.
0,63,50,DANIEL,No I'm real. I'm real. You're not hallucinating.
0,63,50,NICK,Hallucinations always say that.
0,63,50,DANIEL,"Not this time Nick. The skull, the skull did this to me. I'm trapped. I'm in another dimension, I'm out of phase, something. Look all I know is I need your help. If you don't help me I don't know how I'm gonna get home."
0,63,50,NICK,So what do you want me to do?
0,63,51,SF,"Sirs, Mr Ballard insisted on seeing both of you immediately."
0,63,51,NICK,"Forgive me, he insisted. Daniel is here."
0,63,51,HAMMOND,Here?
0,63,51,DANIEL,Repeat what I'm saying. I'm standing right beside you.
0,63,51,NICK,Standing right beside me.
0,63,51,O'NEILL,He's lost a few pounds.
0,63,51,DANIEL,"Jack, don't be an ass."
0,63,51,NICK,"Jack, don't be an ass."
0,63,51,O'NEILL,Daniel?
0,63,51,DANIEL,Yes. We have to go back to the planet and we have to let the skull finish what it started.
0,63,51,NICK,We must go back to the planet.
0,63,51,HAMMOND,Planet?
0,63,51,O'NEILL,"Not a word Sir, I swear."
0,63,51,NICK,Daniel told me all about the Stargate. We must replace the skull on the pedestal so that the giant aliens will come. Something must have interrupted the process.
0,63,51,O'NEILL,Teal's fired a zat. That's all I could imagine it would be Sir.
0,63,51,DANIEL,"That's it. That's what interrupted the process. We have to, we have to let it happen. We have to, we have to trust it."
0,63,51,HAMMOND,Why didn't you say something sooner?
0,63,51,NICK,I thought I was hearing voices. It wouldn't have been for the first time.
0,63,51,FRAISER,"Forgive me, but why are you the only person who can see him?"
0,63,51,NICK,Perhaps because I went through the same experience.
0,63,51,DANIEL,Tell General Hammond if we go back right now he might be able to see his granddaughters school play after all.
0,63,51,NICK,"General Hammond, if you let us go now you might be able to see your granddaughters play."
0,63,51,HAMMOND,"I was alone in my office when Kayla phoned. Doctor Jackson, are you absolutely certain you and SG1 can safely return to the planet?"
0,63,51,DANIEL,Say yes.
0,63,51,NICK,Yes.
0,63,51,O'NEILL,It's good enough for me Sir.
0,63,53,O'NEILL,"So it wasn't the skull alone that did this, it's its connection to the cavern?"
0,63,53,DANIEL,"Yes, I think the skull is just the icon.."
0,63,53,NICK,Yes.
0,63,53,O'NEILL,Daniel said you should come along to make it work?
0,63,53,DANIEL,"Wait, I never said that. You're taking advantage of me."
0,63,53,NICK,Yes.
0,63,55,NICK,So this is what you have been doing these past few years?
0,63,55,DANIEL,Exploring planets.
0,63,55,HAMMOND,
0,63,56,NICK,"Then, behind that there's another world. You must tell me everything."
0,63,56,DANIEL,"As soon as we get back, I promise."
0,63,56,TEAL'C,After you Nicholas Ballard.
0,63,56,NICK,It's just as I remembered it. This is where they live.
0,63,58,NICK,Now we must wait for the giant aliens.
0,63,58,O'NEILL,That just has a nice ring to it.
0,63,58,O'NEILL,"General Hammond, we're in position."
0,63,58,HAMMOND,"Understood Colonel, proceed."
0,63,59,CARTER,"Sir, radiation is climbing again."
0,63,59,NICK,This is incredible.
0,63,59,O'NEILL,Daniel said to let it happen.
0,63,60,CARTER,Daniel!
0,63,60,DANIEL,Sam! It worked.
0,63,60,TEAL'C,O'Neill? Major Carter?
0,63,60,O'NEILL,Carter?
0,63,60,CARTER,It appears that we're out of phase like Daniel but Teal'c isn't.
0,63,60,DANIEL,Why?
0,63,60,O'NEILL,You're asking me?
0,63,60,TEAL'C,General Hammond. I was not teleported with the others.
0,63,60,HAMMOND,Return to base immediately.
0,63,61,O'NEILL,Holy smoke bullwinkle! Hello! What's your name?
0,63,61,QUETLZELCOATL,Oo ya wolin wolin we tayil.
0,63,61,O'NEILL,Daniel?
0,63,61,DANIEL,The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
0,63,61,O'NEILL,I know what it's saying. Why's it saying that?
0,63,61,DANIEL,It didn't affect Teal'c. Why?
0,63,61,CARTER,Because he's jaffa.
0,63,61,DANIEL,He's carrying a symbiote. The goa'uld. We are enemies of the goa'uld.
0,63,61,QUETLZELCOATL,Then you are welcome here.
0,63,61,O'NEILL,Keep talking.
0,63,61,DANIEL,"We're travelers, we come in search of friendship. We'd like to exchange our knowledge and culture."
0,63,61,QUETLZELCOATL,We accept your proposition. You may remain.
0,63,61,NICK,Me?
0,63,61,O'NEILL,Him?
0,63,61,QUETLZELCOATL,This is not the first time you have journeyed here.
0,63,61,NICK,You remember.
0,63,61,DANIEL,There are others among our people who would gladly return.
0,63,61,NICK,No Daniel. Let me.
0,63,61,DANIEL,"Nick,"
0,63,61,NICK,This was my life's work. I've been hoping for another chance at this for 20 years. Please.
0,63,61,DANIEL,"You just came back into my life,"
0,63,61,NICK,I'll be back again. Please.
0,63,61,QUETLZELCOATL,Look again into the eyes of the skull.
0,63,61,O'NEILL,"Well, Nick, take notes."
0,63,61,NICK,I will.
0,63,61,DANIEL,You have to tell me everything.
0,63,61,NICK,"I promise. Daniel, I am proud of you."
0,63,61,DANIEL,"Goodbye, Grandpa."
