0,65,0,"""SMALL VICTORIES""","By Robert C. Cooper We begin with a scene of water, then going underwater --- to a submarine. An alarm is sounding. Two sailors are speaking Russian. Clanking is heard. They open the hatch, and water comes out scaring one of them. Whirring is heard. The replicator attacks one of the sailors."
0,65,0,JANET,I hear it took a little longer than they thought to set up the second gate.
0,65,0,DANNY,"Uh, yes. They finally got it running yesterday. Technical difficulties or something."
0,65,0,JANET,"They needed Sam's help, huh?"
0,65,0,DANNY,"Yes, it's It's ironic she's not here to save herself."
0,65,0,JANET,"Well, you are fine. There's no sign of residual infection. You were very lucky."
0,65,0,DANNY,That's what they keep saying.
0,65,0,JANET,"Well, I still want you to take it easy fo ---"
0,65,0,TECH. DAVIS,Off world activation! We have an off world activation .
0,65,0,JANET,At least a week! O-Kay!
0,65,0,DANNY,
0,65,0,TECH DAVIS,"Receiving SG-1's I.D.C. , Sir."
0,65,0,GH,Open the iris.
0,65,0,JACK,"Well, it's about time!"
0,65,0,SAM,We've been dialing home for about a week!
0,65,0,DANNY,"It's great to see you guys, too."
0,65,0,TEAL'C,"I am pleased to see you well, DanielJackson."
0,65,0,DANNY,"Thank you, Teal'C. You've got a ---"
0,65,0,JACK,Don't! Don't touch it.
0,65,0,GH,"Glad you made it, SG-1."
0,65,0,JACK,"Where's the fanfare, General?"
0,65,0,SAM,"We did kinda save the planet, Sir."
0,65,0,JACK,"Again. This should not get old, General."
0,65,0,GH,Job well done.
0,65,0,JACK,"Thank you , Sir. It was nothing."
0,65,0,DANNY,What happened to Thor?
0,65,0,SAM,"Oh, we got him out in the Stasis pod."
0,65,0,TEAL'C,He was retrieved when we passed thru the stargate on P4X-234.
0,65,0,SAM,It must have had a locating beacon.
0,65,0,GH,They left you behind?
0,65,0,SAM,"We were fine, Sir."
0,65,0,JACK,I'd be happy to Debrief you all after I've had a nice hot shower.
0,65,0,GH,"Permission to shower granted. In fact, I insist on it, Colonel!"
0,65,0,JACK,Bad?
0,65,0,DANNY,I wasn't gonna say anything.
0,65,1,JACK,What ya doin'?
0,65,1,SAM,"They salvaged a couple of replicator pieces from the ocean, I thought I'd take a look."
0,65,1,JACK,Is that --- wise?
0,65,1,SAM,"Well, there's no discernable energy being emitted. I think it's pretty safe to say they're dead. Besides, it's only just a couple of little blocks."
0,65,1,JACK,"Well, I'm off."
0,65,1,SAM,Still going fishing?
0,65,1,JACK,Yep. Still staying here?
0,65,1,SAM,"Yeah. I think I've had enough relaxation for a while, Sir."
0,65,1,SAM,Have fun.
0,65,1,JACK,Ya Sure Ya Betcha!
0,65,1,SAM,"Carter? Yes, Sir. Sir, wait ---"
0,65,2,SAM,General Hammond just called. Major Davis just called from the Pentagon.
0,65,2,JACK,
0,65,2,SAM,"No, Sir."
0,65,2,JACK,Do'Oh!
0,65,3,JACK,That's Russian.
0,65,3,DAVIS,Yes. Code name Black Bird. The crew was being attacked by a large mechanical spider.
0,65,3,JACK,
0,65,3,DAVIS,"We thought it was a joke at first, then the transmission cut out. Approximately 17:00 hours , the sub was spotted by aircraft off the Nemitz, it was already surfaced, and none of the attempts to communicate were returned. It was boarded. The crew was found dead."
0,65,3,SAM,All of them?
0,65,3,DAVIS,They got the bodies off before they discovered how they died.
0,65,3,JACK,That's them.
0,65,3,SAM,"Sir, if this started with only one bug, it's already replicating."
0,65,3,DAVIS,"The man that took the pictures factually, made it out. Then the pentagon advised the Navy to tow the sub."
0,65,3,GH,Do the Russians know WE have it?
0,65,3,DAVIS,"No, no. We're denying any knowledge, but uh --- this is going to get sticky."
0,65,3,SAM,We have to make sure that none of the replicates get out of that sub.
0,65,3,DAVIS,It's under TIGHT supervision. The whole Harbor has been excavated and the entire area cortered off. Our cover story is a dangerous chemical spill.
0,65,3,JACK,Blow it up!
0,65,3,DAVIS,The Pentagon has requested that we take measures to preserve a number of specimens for study.
0,65,3,JACK,"The Asguard already tried that, and these buggers are on the verge of wiping out their entire race."
0,65,3,DAVIS,That's why I'm here. You people are the closest things to experts we've got.
0,65,3,JACK,"As an expert, I'm saying Blow it up!"
0,65,3,SAM,"Sir, conventional weapons might not do it. At least one of the replicators survived the destruction of Thor's ship."
0,65,3,JACK,"Well, fine. Tow it back out to sea, and Nuke it!"
0,65,3,DAVIS,We've considered that.
0,65,3,GH,"We're in a political mess right now, Colonel. The Russians picked up the Asguard ship's reentry into the atmosphere."
0,65,3,JACK,(Ever so clueless!
0,65,3,DAVIS,They're not buying our version of the story. They already think we're responsible for what happened with their sub. A nuclear explosion in international waters --- it's kinda hard to cover up.
0,65,3,SAM,I don't think you realize how DANGEROUS these things are.
0,65,3,DAVIS,
0,65,3,TEAL'C,"The replicators are impervious to Goa'Uld technology. They are, however susceptible to human projectile weaponry. (Davis looks at Jack"
0,65,3,JACK,Guns.
0,65,3,SAM,"Sir, if there's still a small enough number of the replicators on board, a properly equipped team could possibly"
0,65,3,JACK,--- Save the world?
0,65,3,SAM,"Getting old for you, Sir?"
0,65,3,DAVIS,I'd better inform the pentagon.
0,65,3,TECH DAVIS,Unscheduled off world activation!
0,65,3,GH,We have no teams off world! Why isn't the iris closing?
0,65,3,TECH DAVIS,"I'm trying, Sir. It's not responding! We're showing an increasing loss of power in the base."
0,65,3,WHAT?!,
0,65,4,JACK,"That's Thor. Stand down! Thor, Old Buddy!"
0,65,4,THOR,"Greetings, O'Neill."
0,65,4,JACK,Good to see ya up and around.
0,65,4,THOR,I owe you and your team a great debt of gratitude for saving my life.
0,65,4,JACK,"Well, here's timing."
0,65,4,SAM,Not all of the replicators were destroyed when your ship exploded entering the atmosphere.
0,65,4,JACK,Maybe you could help us out?
0,65,4,THOR,I cannot.
0,65,4,JACK,Why?
0,65,4,THOR,"I have come by stargate because there are no ships to spare. My home world is being threatened by the replicators. Thus far, all attempts to stop them have failed. I have come here to seek YOUR help."
0,65,4,TECH DAVIS,"We're back online, Sir."
0,65,4,GH,Good!
0,65,4,JACK,How can WE help YOU?
0,65,4,THOR,Your projectile weapons proved effective in damaging the replicators.
0,65,4,JACK,Some.
0,65,4,THOR,Your technology and strategy for destroying the Balitzner was successful.
0,65,4,JACK,"Yeah, but --- you guys ---"
0,65,4,THOR,The Asguard have tried to stop them. You have demonstrated their weakness can be found thru a less sophisticated approach. We are no longer capable of such thinking.
0,65,4,DANNY,Wait a minute! You're actually saying you need someone DUMBER than you are?
0,65,4,JACK,You may have come to the right place.
0,65,4,GH,"Thor, with all due respect, we need SG-1 here."
0,65,4,SAM,"I could go, Sir."
0,65,4,JACK,"I don't know, Carter. You may not be dumb enough."
0,65,4,SAM,"I think I can handle it, Sir."
0,65,4,GH,Permission granted.
0,65,4,THOR,We must leave immediately.
0,65,4,JACK,Have fun!
0,65,4,SAM,Ya sure ya betcha!
0,65,5,JACK,"Simple recon, Gentlemen. Do not fire unless ABSOLUTELY necessary."
0,65,5,TEAL'C,The replicators will not attack unless threatened.
0,65,5,JACK,Let's move.
0,65,5,SILER,Video feed's up and online.
0,65,5,DANNY,Jack? Can ya hear me?
0,65,5,JACK,Would it be necessary for me to mention my insane aversion to bugs at this time?
0,65,6,SAM,Wow! That's an impressive looking ship!
0,65,6,THOR,~The O'Neill~ was supposed to be our last great hope.
0,65,6,SAM,~The O'NEILL ~ ??!!
0,65,6,THOR,Yes. It is the most advanced technological Asguard creation yet. It is the first Asguard vessel designed solely to fight against the replicators.
0,65,6,SAM,"So, why aren't we taking that?"
0,65,6,THOR,It is not ready.
0,65,6,SAM,"Uh, where are we going , exactly?"
0,65,6,THOR,"5 Asguard ships are currently engaging 3 ships controlled by the replicators, which are on their way here. We are going to join the battle, and with your help, stop them."
0,65,6,SAM,O-Kay.
0,65,6,THOR,"For the sake of the Asguard, we must not fail."
0,65,6,SAM,No pressure.
0,65,8,JACK,They're a different color.
0,65,8,DAVIS,Some sort of camouflage?
0,65,8,JACK,We're movin' on.
0,65,9,DAVIS,What is THAT?
0,65,10,DAVIS,That's a big one!
0,65,10,DANNY,"If that's some sort of Queen, the other bugs may try to protect it."
0,65,11,DANNY,Teal'C and Stevens are in trouble!
0,65,11,SILER,Battery room!
0,65,12,JACK,Stevens?
0,65,12,TEAL'C,Dead.
0,65,12,JACK,Let's move!
0,65,13,THOR,"Each individual building block is capable of exerting a reactive modulating monopolar energy field on other blocks, allowing the replicators to assemble themselves into many forms. To our knowledge, the interior of each block contains the following: 2 million isolated kiron passages."
0,65,13,SAM,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's a kyron?"
0,65,13,THOR,"In simplest terms, it is an energy particle."
0,65,13,SAM,I've never even heard of it!
0,65,13,THOR,"Yes, I am aware."
0,65,13,SAM,"Well, how am I supposed to figure out a way to defeat a kiron based technology, if I don't know what a Kiron is?"
0,65,13,THOR,"The Asguard can never invent a weapon that propels small weights of iron and carbon alloys by igniting a powder of Potassium nitrate, charcoal, and sulpher."
0,65,13,SAM,
0,65,13,THOR,We can not think like you.
0,65,13,SAM,
0,65,13,THOR,Correct.
0,65,13,SAM,I guess you don't keep any replicators around for study?
0,65,13,THOR,It is too dangerous.
0,65,13,SAM,"Of course. That would be stupid. Just out of curiosity. Could, say, oh, I don't know --- 2 blocks replicate?"
0,65,13,THOR,It requires several blocks working together to make new blocks.
0,65,13,SAM,That's good to know. It's virtual? Wow! It looks real. WOW!
0,65,13,THOR,It will simulate any behavior we have observed.
0,65,14,JACK,It's out of control. No body's going back down there.
0,65,14,DAVIS,"(Matching Jack's yummyness all the time, in his dress blues!"
0,65,14,JACK,It's the only way.
0,65,14,DAVIS,I'll talk to the Pentagon.
0,65,14,JANET,"Colonel? There's definitely something in here. Well, I think you brought back a souvenir."
0,65,14,THOR,What is your current thinking process?
0,65,14,SAM,"Sorry! My mind was wondering for a second, there."
0,65,14,THOR,You were thinking about the humans on your planet.
0,65,14,SAM,Yes.
0,65,14,THOR,Colonel O'Neill is a very capable human.
0,65,14,SAM,"Yes, I know, but these things are ---"
0,65,14,THOR,"If we are able to stop the invasion of my world, I promise, we will do everything we can to help yours."
0,65,14,SAM,That's a pretty big IF.
0,65,14,THOR,Would you like sustenance?
0,65,14,SAM,Yes! Thank you. I'm starving.
0,65,14,THOR,I like the yellow ones.
0,65,14,SAM,"Oh, my God! Sorry. What is it?"
0,65,14,THOR,We have lost contact with the rest of the asguard ships engaged in battle with the replicators.
0,65,14,SAM,"Well, could it be a communication problem?"
0,65,14,THOR,No. The Asguard ships are not being detected.
0,65,14,SAM,"So, what are those?"
0,65,14,THOR,The replicators.
0,65,14,SAM,We're too late!
0,65,15,DAVIS,
0,65,15,THE DALLAS?,
0,65,15,DAVIS,"A class-attack submarine. On my command, they'll target THE BLACKBIRD with torpedoes."
0,65,15,DANNY,You should probably put a hold on that. This new block is corroded.
0,65,15,JACK,And the significance of that is ---?
0,65,15,DANNY,"Ok, look. The way Sam explained this to me, the bugs use whatever raw material's around them to replicate. Now, these ones are eating the Russian submarine, which means they're made of steel or what ever the sub is made of."
0,65,15,TEAL'C,That is why they are a different color.
0,65,15,DANNY,And it may also explain why they haven't tried to get off the Russian sub yet.
0,65,15,JACK,It does?
0,65,15,DANNY,"They can't. You see, they're only as resilient as the raw materials they're made of. These ones aren't like the ones on Thor's ship, though. They'll rust or short circuit in the water. They're less sophisticated and they're vulnerable."
0,65,15,DAVIS,"I'm sorry. It sounds like you're now saying that blowing up the ship will easily destroy them. If that's the case, why don't we just do it right now?"
0,65,15,DANNY,"Because, there's still one bug that could survive."
0,65,15,TEAL'C,The one that survived Thor's ship.
0,65,15,JACK,
0,65,15,DANNY,Right. It's the one that started all this by killing the entire crew of that ship. We have to make sure this doesn't happen again.
0,65,15,JACK,Mother bug.
0,65,15,DAVIS,It's a little dark.
0,65,15,DANNY,It's incorporated itself into the mother --- bug.
0,65,15,TEAL'C,"I will return with you, O'Neill."
0,65,15,JACK,Ya sure?
0,65,15,DANNY,"Uh, look, every other bug on that sub will probably be pretty upset when you kill MOM."
0,65,15,JACK,Yeah! That'd be a fair reaction.
0,65,15,TEAL'C,"Could we not create a diversion? The replicators are attracted to bursts of energy, are they not?"
0,65,15,JACK,"A small charge on the upper level, draw them away from mom. They're in a containable situation. Now's our shot."
0,65,15,SILLER,The sub's diesel engines just started.
0,65,15,DANNY,The replicators are trying to move?!
0,65,15,DAVIS,"We're anchored for now, but you better get out there before they decide to dive."
0,65,15,SAM,"So, how long before they reach your planet?"
0,65,15,THOR,2 hours.
0,65,15,SAM,Your ships can go much faster than light speed! I've seen you fly clear across the galaxy in no time.
0,65,15,THOR,Yes.
0,65,15,SAM,"So, why are the bug's ships going so slow?"
0,65,15,THOR,"In order to generate the subspace field required to travel at hyper speed, the full power of the generators is required. Presently, they are using that power to replicate."
0,65,15,SAM,"So, if they DID decide to go to hyper-speed, it would mean no shields or weapons?"
0,65,15,THOR,"Yes. But remember, the replicators do not care about time as we do."
0,65,15,SAM,Right. They're not in a hurry. How do they get control of your ships in the first place?
0,65,15,THOR,The replicators are capable of modifying our own weapon technology beyond our understanding.
0,65,15,SAM,But I thought they learned everything they know from you.
0,65,15,THOR,It is possible they have gathered information from sources other than the Asguard.
0,65,15,SAM,
0,65,15,THOR,Yes.
0,65,15,SAM,So why don't they?
0,65,15,THOR,"We have shown no signs of aggression, and this ship's technology is less advanced than that of the ships they currently occupy."
0,65,15,SAM,"I'm not really helping, am I?"
0,65,16,JACK,Charge is set.
0,65,16,SILLER,They're submerging.
0,65,16,DAVIS,"Yes, Sir."
0,65,16,DANNY,"Jack, the sub is diving."
0,65,16,JACK,"Yeah, we got that. Heading to the battery deck."
0,65,16,DANNY,We're loosing their signal.
0,65,16,DAVIS,It's OK. The sub can't dive below periscope depth running on diesel engines.
0,65,16,SILLER,Underwater radio transmitters boosters launched.
0,65,16,DANNY,How do they get out if the sub's underwater?
0,65,16,DAVIS,"Escape hatch. Yes, Sir!"
0,65,16,THOR,You are tired.
0,65,16,SAM,Yeah.
0,65,16,THOR,This is another advantage the replicators have over us. They do not require rest.
0,65,16,SAM,But they do have to eat?
0,65,16,THOR,"Yes, in order to replicate."
0,65,16,SAM,"and they ARE what they eat, right? What's the strongest material you know of?"
0,65,16,THOR,"We have just developed a new alloy of naquata, triennium, and carbon. It was used to create the hull of THE O'NEILL."
0,65,16,SAM,Can that ship reach hyper-speed yet?
0,65,16,THOR,Yes.
0,65,16,SAM,Can it be flown using auto-pilot or some sort of remote control?
0,65,16,THOR,Why?
0,65,16,SAM,So we can get the replicators to chase after it.
0,65,16,THOR,"It is possible, however ---"
0,65,16,SAM,This ship is everything they're looking for! It'll look like an all-you-can-eat buffet!
0,65,16,THOR,"But it is not completed. They will capture it, and consume it's technology."
0,65,16,SAM,Not if you rig it to self-destruct.
0,65,16,THOR,I do not understand.
0,65,16,SAM,
0,65,16,THOR,"Major Carter, you are suggesting we destroy the most advanced Asguard attack vessel ever created before it is even finished."
0,65,16,SAM,I know!
0,65,16,THOR,
0,65,16,SAM,"It won't attack ANYTHING if the bugs get to your planet before it's finished. You said yourself, you didn't think the answer had anything to do with your own technology anymore."
0,65,16,THOR,But if the replicators do not follow
0,65,16,SAM,We have to believe they will.
0,65,16,THOR,"Then if the replicators are able to infest THE O'NEILL, and disable the self-destruct ---"
0,65,16,SAM,"Then they will consume the ship, and it's technology, and we will have created the most advanced replicators yet. I know! It's a risk."
0,65,16,THOR,A risk we can not take.
0,65,17,SAM,"The whole reason that I am here is to suggest a strategy that you would NEVER think of. You keep trying to defeat them by building better technology, and they keep absorbing it, and becoming more advanced. You HAVE to use that against them! We KNOW they'll go after THE O'NEILL, because it's the most advanced ship you have. They'll think you're trying to keep it from them. They won't expect you to blow it up, it's a tactic they've never seen before."
0,65,17,THOR,It's a tactic we'd never consider.
0,65,17,SAM,"Exactly! I mean, other wise, we'd just stand here, and watch them invade your world. I'm sorry! Maybe it's a really STUPID idea, but isn't that why I'm here?"
0,65,17,THOR,Then we should try it.
0,65,18,JACK,Son of a BITCH!
0,65,18,TEAL'C,"I believe you got it, O'Neill."
0,65,18,JACK,What the HELL?!
0,65,18,TEAL'C,O'Neill!
0,65,18,JACK,"Seeing a bunch of pissed off little techno bugs!) Oh, crap!"
0,65,18,DAVIS,"Colonel O'Neill, is there any way you can make it to the escape hatch?"
0,65,18,SILLER,The anchor line just snapped.
0,65,18,DANNY,Is there anything we can do?
0,65,18,DAVIS,"Best thing we can do right now is try and chase them into shallow water, and hope that they surface."
0,65,18,DANNY,"No, there's not enough time for that."
0,65,18,JACK,Teal'C! Let's try this. All right! Forget that! You better go ahead and blow this thing!
0,65,18,DANNY,"That's not exactly a positive attitude, Jack!"
0,65,18,JACK,
0,65,18,DANNY,
0,65,18,JACK,
0,65,18,THOR,The O'NEILL has been launched.
0,65,18,SAM,They're chasing it!
0,65,18,THOR,
0,65,18,SAM,"It worked! Yes! OH! I'm sorry, I didn't hurt you, did I?"
0,65,18,THOR,I am fine.
0,65,18,SAM,We did it!
0,65,18,THOR,"It was YOUR stupid idea, Major Carter."
0,65,18,DANNY,Ok! OK!
0,65,18,DAVIS,Fire on target.
0,65,18,SILLER,
0,65,18,DANNY,They're OK!
0,65,18,DAVIS,What?!
0,65,18,DANNY,The --- the --- the --- th --- th --- they're OK!
0,65,18,JACK,"Now, THAT'S timing!!!!!!!!"
0,65,18,SAM,"We came as soon as we could, Sir."
0,65,18,JACK,"Teal'C, you all right?"
0,65,18,TEAL'C,"I am, O'Neill."
0,65,18,SAM,I take it things weren't going well.
0,65,18,JACK,"Oh, we had things handled pretty good."
0,65,18,SAM,So the bugs are all taken care of down there?
0,65,18,JACK,Pretty much. You?
0,65,18,SAM,We kicked their asses.
0,65,18,JACK,They had asses?!
0,65,18,SAM,"The Asguard had this big new ship, THE O'NEILL ---"
0,65,18,JACK,"Oh, yeah?"
0,65,18,SAM,But --- we had to blow it up.
0,65,18,THOR,The Asguard are most grateful. One day we will repay you by helping to fight the Goa'Uld.
0,65,18,JACK,One day?
0,65,18,THOR,"Saving one Asguard planet is a small victory, O'Neill. The conflict with the replicators stretches across my galaxy. Major Carter's strategy worked this time, but the replicators are very intelligent, it may not work again."
0,65,18,JACK,I get it.
0,65,18,THOR,"However, now there is hope where once there was none."
