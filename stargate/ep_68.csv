0,68,0,"""CROSSROADS""",By Katharyn Michaelian Powers We see the gate activating and guards surrounding it with their weapons drawn. This iris is closed.
0,68,0,WALTER DAVIS,"Off world activation, repeat, we have an off world activation."
0,68,1,DAVIS,We're receiving Bra'Tac's IDC sir.
0,68,1,JACK,Bra'Tak?
0,68,1,HAMMOND,"Open the iris, have Teal'C come to the gate room."
0,68,2,SHO'NAC,I mean you no harm.
0,68,3,JACK,Bra'Tak! .you've ... done something with your hair!
0,68,3,HAMMOND,Identify yourself!
0,68,3,SHO'NAC,I am Sho'Nak of the Red Hills. Master Bra'Tak opened the Chappa'ai but was unable to accompany me.
0,68,3,JACK,Why is that?
0,68,3,SHO'NAC,There is much unrest on Chulak. He took great risk in sending me here. Teal'C!
0,68,3,TEAL'C (SURPRISED),Sho'Nak!
0,68,3,JACK,Friend of yours?
0,68,3,TEAL'C,Indeed.
0,68,4,SHO'NAC,Kell matee Teal'C.
0,68,4,TEAL'C,Kell matee!
0,68,4,JACK,Teal'C . how about a little introduction of some sort.
0,68,4,SHO'NAC,There is no need. BRA'TAC has told me much of the Tau'ri. You are O'NEILL.TEAL'C'S apprentice.
0,68,4,O'NEILL,Yes. apprentice?
0,68,5,SHO'NAC,Also a warrior of great skill and cunning.
0,68,5,O'NEILL,Apprentice?
0,68,6,SHO'NAC,
0,68,6,HAMMOND,What can we do for you?
0,68,6,SHO'NAC,You must take me to the Tok'ra immediately. I have information that could destroy the Goa'uld.
0,68,7,SHO'NAC,I have found a way to communicate with my symbiote.
0,68,8,TEAL'C,It is not.
0,68,8,SHO'NAC,That is what we were trained to believe TEAL'C. The Goa'uld have no wish for the Jaffa to influence their young.
0,68,8,DANIEL,That makes sense.
0,68,8,TEAL'C,How then was this communion achieved?
0,68,8,SHO'NAC,Within a deep state of Kel'no'reen.
0,68,8,SAM,Well we know that the symbiote is completely isolated from the Jaffa who carries it. How can there be communication?
0,68,8,JANET,Medically speaking the symbiote acts almost like an internal organ. There's an exchange of hormones and electrical impulses but it's on a completely unconscious level.
0,68,8,HAMMOND,It's a function of their immune system.
0,68,8,SHO'NAC,It has taken many years but I have raised that primal communication to the conscious level.
0,68,8,DANIEL,"Oh ok, assuming that you err.what do you talk about?"
0,68,8,SHO'NAC,I have convinced it that the Goa'uld are evil. That its own desires for power and domination are wrong. It is willing to join the Tok'ra and reveal all Goa'uld secrets to them. (She looks at HAMMOND
0,68,8,O'NEILL,I know I'm just the apprentice at this table but.
0,68,8,TEAL'C,Why then not instruct this symbiote to deliver these secrets directly?
0,68,8,O'NEILL,Exactly.
0,68,8,SHO'NAC,"We do not communicate in words. It is more feelings, images, memories. It will only be fully capable of communicating the knowledge it was born with once it takes a host."
0,68,8,CARTER,And since you convinced it that the Goa'uld are evil it ill only take a willing host?
0,68,8,SHO'NAC,It is most urgent!
0,68,8,TEAL'C,Your symbiote is ready to take a host even now!
0,68,8,SHO'NAC,It has already passed its time. You have my word that it will harm no one. I have convinced it to wait!
0,68,9,JANET,Once a Goa'uld larvae leaves the body the Jaffa's immune system stops functioning. You're putting yourself at great risk.
0,68,9,SHO'NAC,I believe that risk is worth taking. If you would take me to the Tok'ra immediately?
0,68,9,HAMMOND,We can't do that I'm sorry.
0,68,9,SHO'NAC,You do not believe I speak the truth.
0,68,9,DANIEL,"No, it's not that we don't believe you."
0,68,9,O'NEILL,I think what TEAL'C is trying to say is that.
0,68,9,TEAL'C,I have said precisely what I intended O'NEILL! (They stare at each other.
0,68,9,JACK,"Ok then I guess what I'm trying to say is that we'd like to believe you, we really would."
0,68,9,SHO'NAC,You have my word. but that is not enough! Then the secrets of the Goa'uld will die with me!
0,68,9,HAMMOND,
0,68,10,TEAL'C,
0,68,11,TEAL'C (HANDS UP),Do not!
0,68,11,TEAL'C,Dr FRASIER you may now approach.
0,68,11,JANET,We need to get her to the infirmary.
0,68,12,JANET,She wasn't exaggerating. The symbiote is fully adult.
0,68,12,JACK,"Yeah, saw that!"
0,68,12,HAMMOND,So her immune system is breaking down?
0,68,12,JANET,"Yes, I'm not sure how long the symbiote will remain before it has no choice but to seek out a new host. That is its primal instinctual behavior. I may have to recommend quarantine sir."
0,68,13,JACK,Absolutely.sir!
0,68,13,SHO'NAC,No.
0,68,13,JANET,I gave you a sedative. You should be asleep.
0,68,13,SHO'NAC,Col-mah has neutralized the sedative.
0,68,13,JANET,Col-mah?
0,68,13,TEAL'C (ANGRILY),It mean's child. The demon you carry within you in no child!
0,68,13,SHO'NAC,Do I not carry it in me as I would my own? Have I not taught it right from wrong as any mother would? You have closed your mind TEAL'C. I expected more!
0,68,14,TEAL'C,May we speak privately?
0,68,14,SHO'NAC,My symbiote has assured me that this will not happen again.
0,68,14,JACK,Oh well if the snake says so then who are we!
0,68,15,SHO'NAC (PAINED),"The others I can understand, but you have known me since before I went to the temple! How can you doubt me? This is my life's work!"
0,68,15,TEAL'C,A life lived in worship of the Goa'uld!
0,68,15,SHO'NAC,"No, I believe now as you do that they are false gods."
0,68,15,TEAL'C,Words from one who became a priestess in the temple.
0,68,15,TEAL'C,
0,68,15,SHO'NAC,He believes TEAL'C. How can I make you believe too?
0,68,15,TEAL'C,There is a way.
0,68,16,CARTER,How is she?
0,68,16,JACK,Err.FRASIER says she has maybe a couple of days tops. Find anything?
0,68,16,DANIEL,No but TEAL'C knows more on the subject than I ever will.
0,68,16,CARTER,He sure doesn't believe her.
0,68,17,CARTER,History?
0,68,17,O'NEILL,Oh yeah!
0,68,17,DANIEL,She's a temple priestess.
0,68,17,O'NEILL,So?
0,68,17,DANIEL,So they don't do a lot of dating.
0,68,17,O'NEILL,"Maybe not, but there was some serious sparkage when she arrived!"
0,68,17,CARTER,"Ok, the question is what if she's telling the truth?"
0,68,17,O'NEILL,"So what, she can't tell the Tok'ra anymore than they already know can she?"
0,68,17,CARTER,"Actually sir she can, the Tok'ra."
0,68,17,CARTER,"Physiologically they're both parasitical and pass on their knowledge through genetic memory yes, but the majority of the Tok'ra left the Goa'uld gene pool over two thousand years ago."
0,68,17,DANIEL,"Yeah, they probably learnt a thing or two in that time."
0,68,17,SAM,Which makes SHO'NAC'S symbiote very valuable sir. To us and the Tok'ra.
0,68,17,JACK,"If TEAL'C doesn't buy it then I don't buy is and there's no way of proving it, so what are you going to do?"
0,68,18,O'NEILL?,
0,68,18,JACK,Master TEAL'C.
0,68,18,TEAL'C,I am in need of your assistance.
0,68,18,O'NEILL,I'm here to serve!
0,68,18,TEAL'C,
0,68,20,TEAL'C,In the deepest levels of Kelnoor-reem the heart beats in extremely long intervals. It is even possible to meditate so deeply that one may stop the heart altogether. The practice is forbidden.
0,68,20,SAM,Wouldn't your symbiote try to start it up again?
0,68,20,TEAL'C,That is correct. According to SHO'NAC it is only at this time that a communion between Jaffa and symbiote is possible.
0,68,20,CARTER,Like a near death experience?
0,68,20,TEAL'C,That is correct.
0,68,20,O'NEILL,Is it dangerous?
0,68,20,DANIEL,
0,68,20,JACK,I mean for us!
0,68,20,TEAL'C,I am unsure of what will occur if and when communion with my symbiote is achieved. It may be necessary to restrain me.
0,68,20,O'NEILL,Well.knock yourself out!
0,68,22,DANIEL,It's working?
0,68,22,TEAL'C,I will begin again.
0,68,24,SAM,"Medical emergency, TEAL'C'S quarters!"
0,68,25,JACK (TO DANIEL),Get him up. What happened?
0,68,25,TEAL'C,I have received a vision from my symbiote. It was a memory it chose to share. Its hatred for me is great.
0,68,25,CARTER,Then it is possible. SHO'NAC is telling the truth.
0,68,25,TEAL'C,Yes.yes!
0,68,26,ANISE,The great queen Ageria. She broke from the Goa'uld over 2000 years ago. Her offspring became the Tok'ra.
0,68,27,O'NEILL,Fountains?
0,68,27,DANIEL,Also childbirth.
0,68,27,O'NEILL,How do those two go together?
0,68,27,DANIEL,"It doesn't matter, she was also adviser to Numo Pontillius, a legendary ruler."
0,68,27,ANISE,Correct Dr JACKSON. Ageria came to the Tau'ri to stop the Goa'uld from taking humans through the Stargate as slaves. Ra found her and killed her but not before she had spawned our movement.
0,68,27,CARTER,Literally?
0,68,27,ANISE,Yes.
0,68,27,O'NEILL,Thanks for the image.
0,68,27,HAMMOND,Then the original number of Tok'ra is all you have?
0,68,27,ANISE,"Very few Goa'uld came over to our side, but none in the past few hundred years. Our numbers have diminished as symbiotes unable to find new hosts died or fell in battle. That is why SHO'NAC'S offer is so provocative. Until the symbiote is blended with a host we cannot be sure of the outcome. But if what she claims is correct we could one day increase our numbers."
0,68,27,HAMMOND,So you've decided to accept her offer?
0,68,27,ANISE,I will make the proposal to the council with my recommendation.
0,68,27,O'NEILL,How long will that take?
0,68,27,ANISE,It will not be an easy decision. There are great risks involved.
0,68,27,CARTER,She doesn't have a lot of time.
0,68,27,TEAL'C,
0,68,27,ANISE,"Then I will leave immediately. (She gets up, as do the others to leave."
0,68,29,TEAL'C,
0,68,29,FREYA,She needs a symbiote to replace that which she now carries.
0,68,29,TEAL'C,By the time you return it may be too late.
0,68,29,FREYA,There are no Jaffa within the Tok'ra ranks.
0,68,29,TEAL'C (EMOTIONALLY),I do not wish for her to die.
0,68,29,FREYA,I cannot promise TEAL'C but we will try.
0,68,31,TEAL'C (SMILING),The Tok'ra council is considering your offer.
0,68,31,SHO'NAC,My symbiote is eager to meet them. I hope they can reach their decision within the time.
0,68,32,TEAL'C,Your pain grows worse!
0,68,32,SHO'NAC,Yes.
0,68,32,TEAL'C,For what reason did you wait so long?
0,68,32,SHO'NAC,I was afraid you would not believe. Since word came to the temple that you betrayed APOPHIS I have thought of you every day.
0,68,32,TEAL'C,As a Shol'va?
0,68,32,SHO'NAC,"No TEAL'C. Because of you my doubts became certainties. When we were children you were always the strongest, the bravest. That you would one day be first prime was never doubted. But you did what no Jaffa before you had ever done. You challenged the gods themselves and won. Among many on Chulak you are as revered as the gods once were and yet you walk away."
0,68,32,TEAL'C,My place is here.
0,68,32,SHO'NAC,Is it? BRA'TAC cannot be expected to bear the burden alone. It was you who first began walking this path. Do not abandon those who have followed you this far!
0,68,33,TEAL'C (ANGRILY),I have abandoned no one.
0,68,34,SHO'NAC,"When I die and you are the only one capable of teaching others what I have learned, what will you do then?"
0,68,34,TEAL'C,Do not concern yourself with me.
0,68,34,SHO'NAC,I have all but given my life for a cause that you inspired!
0,68,34,TEAL'C,"Tell skak, Kree! I will advise you when there is news."
0,68,34,SHO'NAC,When you touched the mind of your symbiote. What did it show you?
0,68,34,TEAL'C (STOPPING),The murder of my father. It was a most painful death.
0,68,34,SHO'NAC,At the hands of CRONOS?
0,68,34,TEAL'C,Yes.
0,68,34,SHO'NAC,It wanted you to know fear.
0,68,34,TEAL'C,Yes.
0,68,34,SHO'NAC,"You are stronger than that. Why does it appear to have succeeded? My first communion was the same. It took many days before I tried again. But one day the images it chose to share with me began to change. They became sorrowful, as though my Ko-mah were awakening to it's own shape. In time the images became beautiful, even caring. If that is all."
0,68,34,SHO'NAC,"No, never more. (They kiss, and make up AQ!-Style!"
0,68,35,TEAL'C!,
0,68,35,TEAL'C (SMILING),Kell shah DANIELJACKSON! (SOMEBODY gots himself a piece of @$$!!! Temple priestess my eye!
0,68,35,DANIEL,"Morning, how's err SHO'NAC?"
0,68,35,TEAL'C,The pain of carrying a symbiote past it's time is extreme. SHO'NAC bears it well.
0,68,35,DANIEL,"I can imagine. Listen, I'm just heading off for breakfast."
0,68,35,TEAL'C,I am not.
0,68,36,DANIEL,Err.could you stop walking?
0,68,37,TEAL'C,Yes. (AQ!'sa note: Of course he's allright! He just got a piece of ...
0,68,37,DANIEL,"You see, I've just noticed that you've been, you know preoccupied lately, obviously and err I'm kinda going out on a limb here asking but it's just that if you want to talk that I was here to talk."
0,68,37,TEAL'C,
0,68,37,DANIEL,And SHO'NAC can teach them?
0,68,37,TEAL'C,If SHO'NAC survives I intend to be at her side. If she does not I will not allow her sacrifice to be in vain!
0,68,38,CARTER,
0,68,38,TEAL'C,When may we depart?
0,68,38,CARTER,"Now, Colonel O'NEILL'S waiting for us in the gear up room."
0,68,41,ANISE,
0,68,41,SHO'NAC,It is a great honor to meet the Tok'ra.
0,68,41,O'NEILL,They're all right if you like the type.
0,68,41,ANISE,It is an equal pleasure to see you Colonel O'NEILL. Your father asked that I shake your hand and give Colonel O'NEILL a big kiss from him.
0,68,42,O'NEILL,"Maybe, is FREYA in there?"
0,68,44,SHO'NAC,Then it is true; host and symbiote share the body equally.
0,68,44,FREYA,"And we are both pleased to tell you good news. As you requested TEAL' C, one of our operatives has retrieved a newly spawned symbiote to replace that which SHO'NAC offers."
0,68,44,SHO'NAC (TO TEAL'C),You have done this for me?
0,68,44,FREYA,Not only for you. If you truly have turned your symbiote to the Tok' ra cause then your life is more valuable than any of ours!
0,68,44,SHO'NAC,". Kell-mah, it will not be long now."
0,68,44,TEAL'C,She has carried her symbiote far past its time.
0,68,44,FREYA,"Then come, this way. We were able to find a host both willing and eager."
0,68,46,ANISE,This is the volunteer host HEBRON of Parabal.
0,68,46,O'NEILL (TO HEBRON),
0,68,46,ANISE,We have told him everything.
0,68,46,O'NEILL,"Yeah, well I've noticed the Tok'ra have a tendency to leave out minor details along the way sometimes. You do know this thing's going to be in your head right? You only get your body part time?"
0,68,46,HEBRON,"My own people were enslaved by the Goa'uld a generation ago, I understand what benefit may come of this."
0,68,46,TEAL'C,This is SHO'NAC.
0,68,47,HEBRON,What can you tell me of the one with whom I will spend the rest of my days?
0,68,47,SHO'NAC,That he wishes to forswear his birthright and desires to stop the Goa'uld from causing any more harm.
0,68,47,HEBRON,Then we will have that in common.
0,68,47,SHO'NAC,"You will share with him much, much more than I. I have waited too long!"
0,68,47,TEAL'C,It must be done now!
0,68,47,ANISE,We are not yet ready for the transference.
0,68,47,SHO'NAC,It can wait no longer! TEAL'C it cannot wait!
0,68,48,ANISE,"Colonel O'NEILL, lower your weapon the transference is complete."
0,68,48,O'NEILL,Transference?!?!?!? THAT'S what you call that!?!?
0,68,48,SHO'NAC?,
0,68,49,HEBRON,"There was no more time, SHO'NAC'S life was in grave danger. I had to act. Have you a prim'ta ready for implantation?"
0,68,49,ANISE,Yes.
0,68,49,HEBRON,"Do it now, she is near death. I am TANITH, it is my honor to pledge my allegiance to the Tok'ra."
0,68,51,DANIEL,How is she?
0,68,52,CARTER,But she's gonna be ok?
0,68,52,ANISE,We believe so.
0,68,53,O'NEILL,Hello HEBRON.
0,68,54,DANIEL,Actually we'd like to hear that from him.
0,68,55,O'NEILL,How do we know that?
0,68,55,HEBRON,
0,68,56,TANITH (SMILING),Of course.
0,68,56,ANISE,When the time is appropriate.
0,68,56,O'NEILL,I think now is appropriate.
0,68,56,ANISE,I disagree.
0,68,56,O'NEILL,"Oh, here we go, here we go!"
0,68,56,ANISE,
0,68,56,O'NEILL (ANGRILY),(Sounding alot like MacGyver
0,68,56,ANISE,We will gladly share what knowledge we feel is useful to the furthering of our alliance with Earth.
0,68,56,CARTER,Does my father go along with this?
0,68,56,ANISE,I am sure he will.
0,68,56,O'NEILL,How do I hang up with ANISE and talk to FREYA?
0,68,56,ANISE,Why?
0,68,56,O'NEILL,I *like* FREYA!
0,68,56,ANISE,She and are in complete agreement.
0,68,56,O'NEILL,How do I know that?
0,68,56,ANISE,I have told you.
0,68,56,O'NEILL,And I'm supposed to trust you.You know this whole talking to two people in one body thing really sucks! (He's genuinly FED UP with the Tok'Ra!
0,68,57,TANITH,
0,68,57,SHO'NAC,"Oh, to speak with you in words it is something I never dreamed of. (JACK looks at SAM, shaking his head, and rolling his eyes; she does the same to DANIEL."
0,68,57,TANITH,There will be time for words. You must stay a while we have so much to talk about.
0,68,57,SHO'NAC,I know.
0,68,57,TEAL'C,Her new symbiote is extremely young for the task of healing her.
0,68,61,ANISE,Colonel! Please take no offense.
0,68,61,O'NEILL,"Hey, we're getting used to it."
0,68,62,O'NEILL,
0,68,62,ANISE,He is welcome of course.
0,68,62,O'NEILL,Swell. let's go.
0,68,62,TEAL'C,
0,68,62,O'NEILL,We'll wait at the gate.
0,68,63,TEAL'C,I must inform the Tau'ri of my intention to leave their service.
0,68,63,SHO'NAC,I will await your return.
0,68,63,TEAL'C,We will return to Chulak and tell every Jaffa in every village of your return.
0,68,63,SHO'NAC,Together!
0,68,63,TEAL'C,Kell mate SHO'NAC.
0,68,63,SHO'NAC,Kell mate my love!
0,68,65,SHO'NAC,Have I disturbed you?
0,68,65,TANITH,The hour is late you should be resting.
0,68,65,SHO'NAC,I could not wait to speak with you.
0,68,65,TANITH,Yes. We must speak of your audacity.
0,68,65,TANITH,How dare a priestess touch the mind of one who would be her god!
0,68,65,SHO'NAC,You despise the Goa'uld!
0,68,66,TANITH,"You showed me the means to destroy the Tok'ra. Now accept your reward. (AQ! Again: He's so sexy, oh, My!"
0,68,67,TEAL'C,It is with much sadness that I must take my leave of the SGC.
0,68,68,HAMMOND,Are you certain?
0,68,68,O'NEILL,He means leave of absence sir!
0,68,68,TEAL'C,I have said what I mean O'NEILL. I intend to live the remainder of my life on Chulak.
0,68,68,O'NEILL,What on Earth for?
0,68,68,TEAL'C,Do you not recognize the greatness of SHO'NAC'S achievement?
0,68,68,DANIEL,I think the point is that if the whole idea was to get the secrets of the Goa'uld into the hands of the Tok'ra.
0,68,68,O'NEILL,And us by the way.
0,68,68,DANIEL,".Then it's done, mission accomplished!"
0,68,68,CARTER,"Yeah TEAL'C, even if you could train a large enough number of Jaffa to communicate with their symbiotes the Tok'ra have a hard enough time finding hosts."
0,68,68,O'NEILL,But the point is you belong here!
0,68,68,TEAL'C,I belong where I am needed most O'NEILL and that is on Chulak at SHO 'NAC'S side.
0,68,69,DAVIS,"Off world activation! Incoming traveler sir, it's the Tok'ra."
0,68,69,O'NEILL,Here to share squat with us no doubt.
0,68,69,HAMMOND,Open the iris.
0,68,70,FREYA,
0,68,70,FREYA,We found the body just outside her chamber. The symbiote she carried was also dead. If we had found a more mature larvae.
0,68,70,TEAL'C,She appeared well!
0,68,70,FREYA,
0,68,70,TEAL'C,". SHO' NAC, tell mah veriunte shree. Tell mah."
0,68,70,DANIEL (TRANSLATING),Our love does not end in death.
0,68,71,ANISE (TO O'NEILL),I wanted TEAL'C to have the body for whatever spiritual ritual he may wish to perform.
0,68,73,O'NEILL,
0,68,73,TEAL'C,
0,68,74,ANISE (SNAKE MODE),We have not yet obtained information of any value from TANITH. Your return is premature.
0,68,74,O'NEILL,You folks should invest in some doors.
0,68,74,ANISE,We have no secrets from each other.
0,68,74,O'NEILL,I beg to differ with you!
0,68,74,TEAL'C,I have reason to believe the Goa'uld SHO'NAC carried was not truly convinced to become a Tok'ra. I believe the Goa'uld used this opportunity to become a spy among you.
0,68,74,ANISE,What evidence have you for this?
0,68,74,TEAL'C,The murder of SHO'NAC! The system lord CRONOS murdered my father by crushing his symbiote in such a way it allowed the symbiotes blood to mix directly with that of my father. The method is slow and immensely painful.
0,68,74,ANISE,How do you know this?
0,68,74,TEAL'C,In communion with my own symbiote. It is a vision my symbiote chose to share.
0,68,74,ANISE,Why?
0,68,74,TEAL'C,To demonstrate Goa'uld hatred and superiority.
0,68,74,ANISE,"Still, if that is your proof."
0,68,74,TEAL'C,We found Goa'uld blood in SHO'NAC'S bloodstream and trace amounts on her hands. Confirming my vision!
0,68,74,ANISE,And so you have come to extract revenge?
0,68,74,TEAL'C (ANGRILY),I have!
0,68,74,ANISE,"I'm sorry, we cannot allow you. Stop him!"
0,68,75,O'NEILL,
0,68,76,ANISE,No! He will be infinitely more valuable to us if we do not.
0,68,77,O'NEILL,You knew!
0,68,79,FREYA,"Yes, if we control what he sees and hears the Goa'uld will never know our true intentions. We will be able to use that advantage for months. When TANITH no longer serves a useful purpose we will extract what Goa'uld secrets we can in other ways."
0,68,79,ANISE,He knew well the risks. When we have learned all we can we plan to remove the Goa'uld. We are fighting a war for our very existence. I make no apologies for the means. Release him.
0,68,81,TANITH (SLOWLY),Hello TEAL'C. You must feel the pain of SHO' NAC'S death as deeply as I do. It is a terrible loss to both of us and has been difficult.Why have you come to see me?
0,68,81,TEAL'C,To look upon you and know that SHO'NAC'S sacrifice will not be in vain.
0,68,81,TANITH,You have my promise. I hope one day we will meet again TEAL'C and together remember she who meant so much to both of us.
0,68,81,TEAL'C,We will meet again. You have my promise.
