0,69,0,"""DIVIDE AND CONQUER""",By Tor Alexander Valenza
0,69,2,O'NEILL,Tuesday doesn't work for the President.
0,69,2,MARTOUF,The High Council of the Tok'ra is making his first journey to Earth to sign an official treaty that outlines our new alliance in the fight against the Goa'uld. What could possibly be more important than that?
0,69,2,GRAHAM,Keeping that treaty a secret from the general population of our planet.
0,69,2,O'NEILL,It's a tricky proposition where we're from.
0,69,2,JACKSON,"The President means no disrespect, but he has to appear before Congress on Tuesday, and there's no way to make up an excuse to get out of that."
0,69,2,O'NEILL,Wednesday? How's Wednesday?
0,69,2,PER'SUS (OFF SCREEN),Wednesday will be fine.
0,69,3,MARTOUF,"Colonel O'Neill, Doctor Jackson, Major Graham, Captain Blasdale..."
0,69,4,MARTOUF,...may I present Supreme High Councilor Per'sus.
0,69,4,PER'SUS,"Please, forgive me for being late."
0,69,5,JACKSON,It's an honor to meet you.
0,69,6,LOOK OUT!,
0,69,7,O'NEILL,Graham!
0,69,8,GRAHAM,Stop . . . stop . . . stop me!
0,69,9,VORASH COUNCIL CHAMBER,
0,69,10,MARTOUF,"Fortunately, High Councilor Per'sus is going to recover."
0,69,11,CARTER,What happened?
0,69,11,O'NEILL,I'd like to know that.
0,69,11,JACKSON,"Well, the High Councilor came in, Martouf introduced us, and Graham went nuts."
0,69,11,CARTER,And he pulled a weapon?
0,69,11,MARTOUF,It seemed to be of Goa'uld origin.
0,69,11,O'NEILL,"Look, Martouf--"
0,69,11,MARTOUF,"Obviously, I do not believe you were complicit with Major Graham's actions."
0,69,12,JACKSON,"Well we weren't, but just out of curiosity, how can you be sure we weren't?"
0,69,12,MARTOUF,I cannot.
0,69,13,FREYA,I can. Major Graham was a zatarc.
0,69,13,O'NEILL,A what?
0,69,13,FREYA,The victim of Goa'uld mind-control technology.
0,69,13,JACKSON,: A what?
0,69,13,FREYA,I believe a mission is programmed into the victim's subconsious. That programming is covered with a false memory.
0,69,13,O'NEILL,You knew this threat was out there?
0,69,13,MARTOUF,"Freya has presented her theory to the High Council, but it is only conjecture. The existence of this technology is thus far unconfirmed."
0,69,13,O'NEILL,"Now, you see, this is just the kind of irresponsible, uncooperative--"
0,69,13,FREYA,": I agree, Colonel. Unfortunately, the High Council did not. Despite the fact that I documented three incidents within the last two months. Otherwise healthy Tok'ra operatives suffered sudden extreme behavioral episodes, each ending in suicide."
0,69,13,O'NEILL,And no red flags went up for anyone?
0,69,13,MARTOUF,A weapon like this has not been used before.
0,69,13,CARTER,So the person in question doesn't know what's gonna happen?
0,69,13,FREYA,"No, they are apparently unaware their minds had been tampered with. The instruction seems to be triggered by a visual or auditory signal."
0,69,13,JACKSON,"Obviously, the High Councilor was the target."
0,69,13,FREYA,"Apparently, when Major Graham was introduced to Per'sus, the programming took over. He would have been unable to control his actions after that."
0,69,13,CARTER,But this is theoretical.
0,69,13,FREYA,It is difficult to prove because of the lack of evidence. I believe the violent self-destructive behavior is an integral part of the programming meant to ensure that result.
0,69,13,JACKSON,How exactly does one get turned into a-a zatarc?
0,69,13,FREYA,The programming only seems to require moments of access with the victims.
0,69,13,O'NEILL,"All right, had we known any of this we might have been able to take a few more precautions."
0,69,13,MARTOUF,"We could not have taken any more precautions than we did, Colonel."
0,69,13,JACKSON,But we could have more of these pre-programmed time bombs out there waiting to go off.
0,69,13,MARTOUF,It is likely that if the Goa'uld knew Major Graham was going to be here to meet the High Councilor...
0,69,13,CARTER,...then they know about the treaty summit.
0,69,13,MARTOUF,Their goal was undoubtedly to sabotage our alliance.
0,69,13,JACKSON,Then the President could also be a target.
0,69,13,MARTOUF,It is the High Councilor's wish to continue with the treaty summit.
0,69,13,O'NEILL,"Oh, I don't think so."
0,69,13,MARTOUF,"In 2000 years, the Tok'ra have never bowed to Goa'uld terrorism. We will not start now."
0,69,13,FREYA,"Either way, it is true that any of your personnel who may have encountered the Goa'uld in the last two months may have fallen victim."
0,69,13,MARTOUF,"The problem is, zatarc programming is virtually impossible to detect."
0,69,13,FREYA,That is not true.
0,69,13,MARTOUF,Your method is unproven.
0,69,13,FREYA,It worked on one previous occasion.
0,69,13,MARTOUF,Even that is in question.
0,69,13,FREYA,It is all we have right now.
0,69,14,WORMHOLE,
0,69,15,HAMMOND,"Colonel. Martouf, Anise, on behalf of the SGC, I want to offer my sincerest apologies and condolences for the lives of the lost Tok'ra."
0,69,16,MARTOUF,High Councilor Per'sus also send regrets for the men of the SGC that were lost. We consider Major Graham as much a victim as anyone.
0,69,16,HAMMOND,All outstanding SG teams are being recalled for screening and placed on a 24-hour watch.
0,69,16,FREYA,I would like to begin with the remaining members of Major Graham's team. There was obviously opportunity to program him on a recent mission.
0,69,16,HAMMOND,This way. Major Carter?
0,69,17,O'NEILL,They're at it again.
0,69,17,CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN EXTERIOR,
0,69,18,FRAISER,"I completed my autopsy on Major Graham. There was an unidentifiable residue from the explosion, but no indication he was under any kind of chemical influence. To be honest, sir, if the Goa'uld were trying to cover up their work, they did a good job."
0,69,18,HAMMOND,What about the infomation about the zatarcs provided by the Tok'ra?
0,69,18,FRAISER,"Pretty limited to speculation, sir. I did a full examination of Major Graham before he went to Vorash, and he seemed to be in perfect health. His bloodwork was clean, last psych evaluation was normal. If his brain was altered in any way, It was done by a technology far beyond my understanding."
0,69,18,HAMMOND,Will this zatarc detector actually work?
0,69,18,FRAISER,It's alien technology. I have no way of knowing.
0,69,18,HAMMOND,Then we're completely in the hands of the Tok'ra on this one.
0,69,18,FRAISER,Colonel must be happy about that.
0,69,18,HAMMOND,"I'm not thrilled about it myself, doctor."
0,69,19,ISOLATION ROOM,
0,69,20,FREYA,"Hello, Lieutenant . . . Astor. Please have a seat."
0,69,21,FREYA,Try to stay calm. Direct your vision here.
0,69,22,FREYA,I will ask you some questions to lead your thoughts. Please answer as completely and truthfully as possible.
0,69,23,FREYA,Describe for me your recent mission to P6Y-325.
0,69,23,ASTOR,Well it . . . it seemed to be a routine meet-and-greet. At least at first. The Losarians were a fairly primitive people.
0,69,24,O'NEILL,So it's a lie detector.
0,69,24,MARTOUF,It's even more. It can detect whether a person is being truthful even if they are not aware they are lying.
0,69,24,JACKSON,So it reads the subconscious?
0,69,24,MARTOUF,And compares it to the conscious memory. It was originally created to verify information retrieved from the torture of captured Goa'uld.
0,69,24,CARTER,That thing on her forehead looks like a Tok'ra memory recall device.
0,69,24,MARTOUF,"Yes, a modified version. It is able to decipher whether the memory being recalled by the subject is true or false."
0,69,24,JACKSON,So it indicates a zatarc because the Goa'uld use false memories to cover the program?
0,69,24,MARTOUF,"That is Anise's theory, yes."
0,69,24,TEAL'C,Can you identify the zatarc's mission?
0,69,24,MARTOUF,"Unfortunately, no. It will only tell us if a person is a zatarc, not what he's programmed to do."
0,69,24,JACKSON,Hello.
0,69,25,ASTOR,. . .Graham and I got separated from Captain Blasdale and Sergeant Lewis. I thought we were lost. We heard the firefight. . . .
0,69,26,MARTOUF,It could mean the lieutenant just reiterated something out of order.
0,69,26,FREYA,"Lieutenant, please repeat the last sequence, and remember to be specific about every detail and your feelings at the time."
0,69,26,ASTOR,"Okay. I really don't know exactly what happened. There wasn't much time to stand around hypothesizing. Just after the sun went down . . . the gliders attacked the village. We booked for the Stargate, but the clearing was filled with Jaffa."
0,69,27,ASTOR (CONT'D),
0,69,28,ASTOR (CONT'D),It felt like they were comin' at us from all sides.
0,69,29,ASTOR,Captain Blasdale radioed from behind. He and Sergeant Lewis were pinned down.
0,69,30,FREYA,How did you feel?
0,69,30,ASTOR,Are you kidding? I was scared out of my mind.
0,69,31,FREYA,Are you certain you shot the Jaffa?
0,69,32,ASTOR,Positive.
0,69,33,GENERAL HAMMOND'S OFFICE,
0,69,34,FREYA,She is a zatarc. Lieutenant Astor's mind has been altered.
0,69,34,O'NEILL,Ya think so?
0,69,34,HAMMOND,What do we do?
0,69,35,FREYA,There is a procedure we could try.
0,69,35,HAMMOND,Is it safe?
0,69,35,FREYA,It is experimental at best.
0,69,35,O'NEILL,"General, need I remind you what happened the last time we trusted this ... woman?"
0,69,35,FREYA,"You are referring to my symbiote Anise, Colonel, and I would not suggest this if I thought there was a better alternative."
0,69,35,HAMMOND,What's the worst-case scenario?
0,69,35,MARTOUF,The procedure actually damages the portion of the brain that has been affected by the zatarc technology.
0,69,35,FREYA,Lt. Astor could lose more than just her false memory.
0,69,35,O'NEILL,How much more?
0,69,35,FREYA,It won't be clear until after the procedure.
0,69,35,HAMMOND,"I hate the idea of sitting here deciding the fate of one of our officers, but what choice do we have?"
0,69,35,O'NEILL,General--
0,69,35,HAMMOND,The security of this base and this planet cannot be compromised.
0,69,35,FREYA,"Furthermore, when her programming is triggered, she will inevitably become self destructive."
0,69,36,HAMMOND,Let's give Lt. Astor the choice.
0,69,36,O'NEILL,Some choice.
0,69,37,ISOLATION ROOM,
0,69,38,ASTOR,"I have to admit, I'm a little scared."
0,69,39,FREYA,I understand. Please try to stay calm.
0,69,39,ASTOR,I swear I shot that Jaffa! Major Graham returned with Captain Blasdale and Sergeant Lewis.
0,69,39,FREYA,"You said you were surrounded. Jaffa were everywhere. Six other SGC team members died that night, yet you and your team managed to get through the Stargate unharmed."
0,69,39,ASTOR,I thought we were just that good.
0,69,40,FREYA,I am going to begin.
0,69,41,ASTOR,It hurts!
0,69,42,STOP! PLEASE! ... STOP!,
0,69,43,O'NEILL,Astor!
0,69,44,NO!,
0,69,45,GENERAL HAMMOND'S OFFICE,
0,69,45,HAMMOND,"Thank you, doctor. Both SFs suffered serious injuries, but they're going to be okay."
0,69,45,FREYA,The Goa'uld programming must have an imbedded failsafe that prevents it from being tampered with. I am sorry you have lost another member of your team. I hold myself accountable.
0,69,46,HAMMOND,The Goa'uld are ultimately accountable.
0,69,46,FREYA,"Unfortunately, we can not analyze the affected area of the victim's brain post-mortem due to the self-inflicted damage."
0,69,46,O'NEILL,Would that really make a difference?
0,69,46,FREYA,"I believe it would, yes."
0,69,46,HAMMOND,There will be no summit unless I can be sure there's no threat to the President.
0,69,46,FREYA,We can complete the zatarc testing in time.
0,69,46,O'NEILL,And if we find more?
0,69,46,HAMMOND,"Greater things than the summit would be in jeopardy, Colonel. Proceed. Dismissed."
0,69,47,O'NEILL,"Well, this is fun. Who's next?"
0,69,47,SG-1.,
0,69,47,O'NEILL,Do'h!
0,69,47,OBSERVATION/ISOLATION ROOMS,
0,69,48,FREYA,"Good, Colonel. Now let's move to your mission on PX9-757."
0,69,49,O'NEILL,Drawin' a blank.
0,69,49,FREYA,Your mission was to destroy a new ship being built by Apophis.
0,69,49,O'NEILL,You know all about that.
0,69,49,FREYA,But the device only works if you recapture your exact memory of the events.
0,69,50,JACKSON,At that point we realized they wouldn't come off.
0,69,50,FREYA,You can jump ahead to the part where you went through the Gate.
0,69,51,CARTER,"We were so strong and fast, the Jaffa on the other side didn't stand a chance."
0,69,53,TEAL'C,General Hammond ordered me to follow. I went through the Gate and proceeded to the facility.
0,69,53,FREYA,So you were alone for some time before you met up with the rest of SG-1?
0,69,53,TEAL'C,Yes.
0,69,54,JACKSON,Um ... I went after the naquadah.
0,69,55,JAFFA (IN FLASHBACK),Don't move!
0,69,56,FREYA,After that?
0,69,56,JACKSON,I headed back to meet Jack and Sam.
0,69,57,O'NEILL,"When I realized Carter wasn't with me, I stopped."
0,69,58,O'NEILL,I went back for her.
0,69,58,FREYA,What happened next?
0,69,58,O'NEILL,That's when your genius armband stopped workin'.
0,69,59,FREYA,You couldn't get through the shield again?
0,69,59,O'NEILL,No.
0,69,60,CARTER,"When I woke up, I saw Colonel O'Neill unconscious on the other side of the force shield. I called his name, and he woke up."
0,69,60,FREYA,Then what?
0,69,60,CARTER,I realized that there was no way I was gonna get through that force shield. I told the Colonel to try and get out without me.
0,69,60,FREYA,To leave you behind?
0,69,60,CARTER,"Yes. The timer on the C-4 was counting down. I knew that without the advantage of the armbands, it was gonna be tight getting back to the Stargate before the ship's power core exploded."
0,69,60,FREYA,What did Colonel O'Neill do?
0,69,62,O'NEILL,Couple of Jaffa came around the corner.
0,69,62,FREYA,And then...?
0,69,62,CARTER,We got lucky.
0,69,62,FREYA,That's it?
0,69,62,CARTER,Yeah. The C-4 explosion must have taken out the shield generator.
0,69,63,CARTER (CONT'D),"The force shield disappeared, and . . . we ran."
0,69,63,FREYA,Sounds easy.
0,69,63,CARTER,Well . . . I wouldn't say that.
0,69,63,FREYA,Are you sure you're telling me everything?
0,69,64,CARTER,Oh! . . . uh . . . I tried to go for the naquadah.
0,69,65,CARTER,But Colonel O'Neill ordered me to leave it.
0,69,65,FREYA,That's everything?
0,69,65,CARTER,Yeah.
0,69,66,CARTER,You aren't serious?
0,69,67,O'NEILL,What?
0,69,67,GENERAL HAMMOND'S OFFICE,
0,69,67,HAMMOND,"We still don't know anything about the targets involved. In the event that we do proceed, I'm forwarding a new plan for your arrival. Yes, sir . . . both Colonel O'Neill and Major Carter. I'll pass that along. Thank you, Mr. President."
0,69,68,SECURITY QUARTERS,
0,69,69,O'NEILL,"Give us a second, huh?"
0,69,70,CARTER,"Sir, this has to be a mistake."
0,69,70,O'NEILL,Tell me about it.
0,69,70,CARTER,"Can you talk to General Hammond about getting me re-tested, I mean there must be--"
0,69,70,O'NEILL,Us.
0,69,70,CARTER,What?
0,69,70,O'NEILL,"Us retested. Apparently, I'm one of those . . . zarc-things too. I'm across the hall."
0,69,71,CARTER,That can't be.
0,69,71,O'NEILL,I know.
0,69,71,CARTER,Although we were both unconsious at the same time.
0,69,71,O'NEILL,Apparently.
0,69,71,CARTER,"Sir, are you worried that it's at least possible?"
0,69,71,O'NEILL,A little.
0,69,72,SGC BRIEFING ROOM,
0,69,73,TEAL'C,I do not believe that Colonel O'Neill and Major Carter are zatarcs.
0,69,73,JACKSON,We can't prove they aren't.
0,69,73,MARTOUF,We must continue to keep them isolated in order to prevent them from being exposed to their programming triggers.
0,69,73,HAMMOND,We don't know for sure it's the President.
0,69,73,FREYA,No.
0,69,73,HAMMOND,Then we're talking about keeping them confined indefinitely.
0,69,73,FRAISER,At least until we can come up with another course of action.
0,69,73,FREYA,The good news is that we have found no more zatarcs among SGC personnel. The High Councilor and his advisors have also been tested back on Vorash. There should be no danger to the summit meeting.
0,69,73,HAMMOND,I want good news regarding Col. O'Neill and Maj. Carter.
0,69,74,FRAISER,"We'll keep working on it, sir."
0,69,74,MARTOUF,What shall I tell the High Councilor regarding the meeting with the President?
0,69,74,HAMMOND,It's on.
0,69,75,SECURITY QUARTERS,
0,69,76,O'NEILL,Yeah?
0,69,77,O'NEILL,Oh. You.
0,69,77,FREYA,You are probably not happy to see me.
0,69,77,O'NEILL,"Well, if you're not here to tell me it's all a big mistake, I might be a little glum."
0,69,77,FREYA,I have come to apologize. It is sort of our fault you are a zatarc ... maybe a little more Anise than me.
0,69,77,O'NEILL,I knew that. I just don't know why yet.
0,69,77,FREYA,The experiment with the armbands was the reason you went on the mission to destroy Apophis's new ship.
0,69,78,O'NEILL,"Hey, listen. What if you're wrong, and Carter and I aren't really, uh--"
0,69,78,FREYA,Zatarcs?
0,69,78,O'NEILL,Zatarcs.
0,69,79,FREYA,I do not believe that is possible.
0,69,79,O'NEILL,Swell.
0,69,80,O'NEILL,Is there somethin' else?
0,69,80,FREYA,I have not thanked you for saving my life on Vorash--when you saved me for a second time during the situation with Lieutenant Astor.
0,69,80,O'NEILL,"No offense, but I'd have done it for anyone."
0,69,81,O'NEILL,Uh ... what ya doin'?
0,69,81,FREYA,I originally came from a planet where the people were not afraid to show their affection for someone. When we wanted to lo'machen--
0,69,81,O'NEILL,Excuse me?
0,69,81,FREYA,I believe you call it...
0,69,81,O'NEILL,...something else.
0,69,81,FREYA,"Anise, my symbiote, is far more interested in Doctor Jackson on an intellectual level, but she would have to suffer."
0,69,81,O'NEILL,"Look, there's so many reasons why this is wrong . . . and . . . weird . . . and . . . wrong. . . . Did I mention wrong?"
0,69,81,FREYA,Is it because I share my body with Anise?
0,69,81,O'NEILL,For starters.
0,69,81,FREYA,Do you not find me attractive?
0,69,82,O'NEILL,Oh . . . you've. . . .
0,69,83,O'NEILL,Hey ... I could blow here any minute.
0,69,83,FREYA,"If I were the target, your zatarc programming would have triggered long ago."
0,69,83,O'NEILL,Good point.
0,69,83,FREYA,Is there someone else to whom you are loyal?
0,69,83,O'NEILL,"Th-th-th-that's not really the point here, is it?"
0,69,83,FREYA,I sense you have been made uncomfortable by my offer.
0,69,83,O'NEILL,"No! No ... it's just ... Well, yeah!"
0,69,83,FREYA,I had heard that the humans of Earth had many inhibitions and stigmas surrounding intimacy.
0,69,83,O'NEILL,"Yes . . . yes, I've heard that too. There's also the matter of timing."
0,69,83,FREYA,I am still quite hopeful we will find a way to help both you and Major Carter.
0,69,83,O'NEILL,"Then maybe you should be out doing that, whadda ya think?"
0,69,84,FREYA,Once again I find myself feeling the need to apologize.
0,69,84,O'NEILL,Oh! No need! {He raps on the window.) We're adults.
0,69,85,FREYA,I will make an effort to learn more about your customs so I will not make you so uncomfortable again.
0,69,86,O'NEILL,"Yes, very good idea. Thank you. Bye."
0,69,87,SGC BRIEFING ROOM,
0,69,88,JACKSON,The President is still uncomfortable with the phrase 'for the common interest of the Tok'ra and the humans of Earth.' I-I'm recommending 'in pursuit of freedom for all individuals.'
0,69,89,MARTOUF,The High Councilor does not like to generalize.
0,69,90,FREYA,Excuse me. I have been reviewing my notes on prior incidents with zatarcs and I'm concerned that we are endangering Major Carter and Colonel O'Neill by keeping them confined.
0,69,90,JACKSON,Why?
0,69,90,FREYA,In at least one case I think the zatarc lost control when it became evident that they could no longer achieve their objective.
0,69,90,JACKSON,So by keeping them confined--
0,69,90,MARTOUF,--they won't be able to fulfil their programming and they will become self destructive.
0,69,90,HAMMOND,Why hasn't that happened yet?
0,69,90,FREYA,"The triggering event hasn't occurred yet. However, if that passes--"
0,69,90,JACKSON,You mean between the High Councilor and the President--
0,69,90,HAMMOND,What if we postpone it?
0,69,90,FREYA,That could have the same effect if the programmed part of their minds believes they are no longer able to fulfil the goal.
0,69,91,JACKSON,So . . . what do we do?
0,69,92,CARTER'S SECURITY QUARTERS,
0,69,93,CARTER,Martouf.
0,69,93,MARTOUF,How are you?
0,69,93,CARTER,I was just writing a letter to my dad.
0,69,93,MARTOUF,I have sent word to him. I'm sure he'll come as soon as he can.
0,69,93,CARTER,Thank you.
0,69,93,MARTOUF,I have come to present an option to you.
0,69,94,CARTER,Not what Freya tried on Lieutenant Astor.
0,69,94,MARTOUF,She thinks that the procedure failed because she stopped before it was finished.
0,69,94,CARTER,Because Astor went crazy.
0,69,94,MARTOUF,Freya thinks that the failsafe protecting the zatarc programming can be overcome if the procedure is given a fair chance to work.
0,69,94,CARTER,What's the rush?
0,69,94,MARTOUF,Freya has seen prior evidence to suggest that if a zatarc is prevented from achieving their objective--
0,69,94,CARTER,--and--
0,69,94,MARTOUF,--if your objective is to target the President--
0,69,94,CARTER,You're saying I would try and kill myself.
0,69,95,MARTOUF (WHISPERS),Yes.
0,69,95,CARTER,"Two days, right? I guess we wait and see."
0,69,95,MARTOUF,Or . . . you could go through with the procedure.
0,69,95,CARTER,"Which could cause me to lose my mind anyway, just like Astor did."
0,69,95,MARTOUR,Yes.
0,69,95,CARTER,"Or, the procedure could work and I could still end up with serious brain damage."
0,69,95,MARTOUF,"Yes, I know. And not only do I not want to risk losing what you still carry of Jolinar, but . . . I've grown quite fond of you as well, Sam."
0,69,96,CARTER,"It's all based on assumptions, right? I mean we don't know that the President is the target; we don't even know if I'll lose my mind because the summit's going on and I'm stuck in here."
0,69,96,MARTOUF,And we don't know for sure that you will suffer any ill effects from the procedure.
0,69,97,CARTER,Some choice.
0,69,98,O'NEILL'S SECURITY QUARTERS,
0,69,99,O'NEILL,Come again?
0,69,100,JACKSON,Bottom line is there's a chance you could come out completely intact.
0,69,101,JACKSON (QUIETLY),Or not.
0,69,101,O'NEILL,What's Carter say?
0,69,101,JACKSON,"I don't know, Martouf is explaining it to her now."
0,69,101,O'NEILL,What would you do?
0,69,101,JACKSON,I honestly don't know.
0,69,102,O'NEILL,She made a pass at me.
0,69,102,JACKSON,Sam?
0,69,102,O'NEILL,"Anise, Freya, one of them."
0,69,102,JACKSON,Really?
0,69,102,O'NEILL,The host half.
0,69,102,JACKSON,Uh . . . that's odd.
0,69,102,O'NEILL,"You're telling me. Odd timing too, don't ya think?"
0,69,102,JACKSON,Yes.
0,69,102,O'NEILL,"Apparently, the snake likes you."
0,69,103,JACKSON,"Really? Yup, I think these are the Jack O'Neill moments I would probably miss the most."
0,69,104,O'NEILL,What?
0,69,104,JACKSON,What?
0,69,104,SGC BRIEFING ROOM,
0,69,105,FREYA,I understand why they wouldn't trust me.
0,69,105,JACKSON,"Oh, I think it's more that they would rather risk dying than lose who they are."
0,69,105,HAMMOND,"We can be sure they won't threaten the President, but how do we keep them from harming themselves during the summit?"
0,69,105,FRAISER,We plan to sedate them and put them in restraints.
0,69,105,JACKSON,Until when?
0,69,105,O'NEILL'S SECURITY QUARTERS,
0,69,106,FRAISER,It's the only way we can be absolutely sure you won't try and hurt yourself.
0,69,107,O'NEILL,No choice?
0,69,108,FRAISER,"No. You won't feel anything, it'll be like falling asleep."
0,69,108,O'NEILL,For how long?
0,69,108,FRAISER,As long as it takes to find a treatment with better odds than the one we have available.
0,69,109,JACKSON,The President is due to arrive in less than an hour.
0,69,110,O'NEILL,Come to say your goodbyes?
0,69,110,TEAL'C,"If there's anything that you require, O'Neill--"
0,69,110,O'NEILL,Another option.
0,69,110,FREYA,There is still time to try the procedure.
0,69,111,O'NEILL,"You said if you could have done a proper autopsy on Astor, you might have been able to solve this thing."
0,69,111,FREYA,It would have provided much more information.
0,69,111,O'NEILL,Do it.
0,69,111,JACKSON,What?
0,69,111,O'NEILL,"Hey, I've done the drugged-out, strapped-to-the-bed thing."
0,69,112,JACKSON,And if what happened to Astor happens to you?
0,69,113,O'NEILL,Maybe it'll help Carter. Her brain's worth a lot more than mine.
0,69,114,CARTER'S SECURITY QUARTERS,
0,69,115,CARTER,What? He can't!
0,69,115,JACKSON,He's on his way down now.
0,69,115,CARTER,Why is he doing this?
0,69,115,JACKSON,He said he'd rather take the risk instead of being put to sleep indefinitely.
0,69,115,CARTER,But Astor--
0,69,115,FRAISER,If it happens he thinks Anise can use what she would learn to save you.
0,69,116,JACKSON,Sam. . . .
0,69,117,CARTER,Colonel!
0,69,118,CARTER,You have to stop him!
0,69,118,JACKSON,It's his choice.
0,69,118,FRAISER,"Sam, please. I have to do this."
0,69,119,SGC CONTROL ROOM,
0,69,120,TECHNICIAN,Incoming traveler.
0,69,121,JACKSON,Jack's going through with the procedure and they're sedating Sam now.
0,69,121,HAMMOND,Open the iris.
0,69,122,HAMMOND (BOWING),Welcome to Earth.
0,69,123,PER'SUS,It's an important occasion for us all.
0,69,123,HAMMOND,Indeed it is.
0,69,123,CARTER'S SECURITY QUARTERS,
0,69,124,CARTER,Janet?
0,69,125,ISOLATION ROOM,
0,69,126,O'NEILL,Right.
0,69,126,SGC EMBARKATION ROOM,
0,69,126,PER'SUS,I was most impressed by the revisions you made to the treaty.
0,69,126,MARTOUF,The credit goes to Dr. Jackson.
0,69,126,TOK'RA,It's an inspiring document. I only hope both parties can live up to it.
0,69,127,HAMMOND,Doctor Jackson. . . .
0,69,129,TECHNICIAN,"Sir, Air Force One has just landed."
0,69,129,HAMMOND (TO PER'SUS),"It will take fifteen minutes for the President's motorcade to arrive. If you'll excuse me, I'll meet him at the surface and then be back soon."
0,69,130,CARTER'S SECURITY QUARTERS,
0,69,131,CARTER,Colonel. . . .
0,69,132,CARTER (IN MEMORY),"Sir, there's no time!"
0,69,133,FRAISER (TO NURSE),We may have to increase the dose.
0,69,133,CARTER (MUMBLING),"The C-4's gonna blow, you have to get out of here."
0,69,133,O'NEILL (IN MEMORY),No!
0,69,134,CARTER,The machine is wrong!
0,69,135,CARTER,You don't understand. We lied. We didn't even know we were lying. Please.
0,69,136,ISOLATION ROOM,
0,69,136,FREYA,"If you are ready, we will begin."
0,69,137,FRAISER,Stop!
0,69,138,O'NEILL,"Carter, what's up?"
0,69,138,CARTER,Could we have a moment alone please? Thanks.
0,69,138,O'NEILL,"Carter, undo this. What's goin' on?"
0,69,138,CARTER,We're not zatarcs.
0,69,138,O'NEILL,How do you know?
0,69,138,CARTER,"The machine thinks that we have false memories, but we don't. We were lying."
0,69,138,O'NEILL,I wasn't lying.
0,69,138,CARTER,Okay. You left something out.
0,69,138,O'NEILL,"No, I didn't."
0,69,138,CARTER,"Sir, when you wouldn't leave me, are you sure there wasn't something else that you're not admitting?"
0,69,138,O'NEILL,What are you talkin' about?
0,69,138,CARTER,"Something neither one of us can admit, given our working relationship, our military ranks...."
0,69,138,O'NEILL,"Oh! Oh, that."
0,69,138,CARTER,"Sir, we weren't telling the whole truth, and that's why the machine thinks the memories are false."
0,69,138,O'NEILL,Really?
0,69,139,CARTER,Re-test him.
0,69,139,SGC CORRIDORS,
0,69,140,HAMMOND,Mister President.
0,69,140,PRESIDENT,"General, nice to see you."
0,69,140,HAMMOND,"Good to see you, sir."
0,69,140,ISOLATION ROOM,
0,69,141,FREYA,Major Carter was trapped behind the force shield.
0,69,141,O'NEILL,That's right.
0,69,143,O'NEILL,There were sounds.
0,69,143,FREYA,You did everything you could.
0,69,143,O'NEILL,Yes.
0,69,143,FREYA,You couldn't save her.
0,69,143,O'NEILL,No.
0,69,143,FREYA,But you still could have saved yourself.
0,69,143,O'NEILL,I guess.
0,69,144,FREYA,What happened next?
0,69,146,FREYA,What were you feeling?
0,69,146,O'NEILL,Like . . . someone who was about to die.
0,69,147,CARTER,Sir. . . .
0,69,148,O'NEILL,I didn't leave . . . because I'd have rather died myself . . . than lose Carter.
0,69,149,FREYA,Why?
0,69,149,O'NEILL,Because I care about her . . . a lot more than I'm supposed to.
0,69,150,FREYA,You are not a zatarc.
0,69,151,CARTER,"Now, re-test me."
0,69,152,FREYA,You are also not a zatarc.
0,69,153,CARTER,Thank you.
0,69,154,O'NEILL,Carter. . . .
0,69,154,CARTER,Sir. . . .
0,69,155,CARTER,None of this has to leave this room.
0,69,156,CARTER,"Yes, sir."
0,69,157,FRAISER,"All right, so if they're not zatarcs then they're no threat to the President."
0,69,157,O'NEILL,"Oh, I have some questions for him."
0,69,157,FREYA,Every SGC personnel has been tested. Even the High Councilor and his personal guard were tested on Vorash before they came.
0,69,157,O'NEILL,"Hey, what about you? You ever been tested on that thing?"
0,69,157,FREYA,I have not been in any situations where I would vulnerable to the Goa'uld zatarc technology.
0,69,157,CARTER,What about Martouf?
0,69,158,"SGC, EMBARKATION ROOM",
0,69,159,JACKSON (TO PER'SUS),Excuse me.
0,69,160,JACKSON,"Martouf, can I talk to you outside for a second?"
0,69,161,HAMMOND,"Supreme High Councilor Per'sus of the Tok'ra, may I introduce the President of the United States of America."
0,69,162,JACKSON,Look out!
0,69,166,MARTOUF,Samantha. . . .
0,69,167,O'NEILL,Drop them.
0,69,168,HAMMOND,Is everyone okay? Per'sus?
0,69,168,PER'SUS,Yes. Is the President all right?
0,69,168,HAMMOND,He's okay. And I'm afraid this man isn't the President. The real President is still waiting for our signal in Air Force One. We had to be absolutely sure.
0,69,168,PER'SUS,I see. May that be the last time such a deception is required by either of us.
0,69,169,FREYA,"I promise you, his death will ultimately prove be a noble sacrifice."
