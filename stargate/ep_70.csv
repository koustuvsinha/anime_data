0,70,0,"""WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY""","By Joseph Mallozzi & Paul Mullie We begin on a planet with a yellow sky. The team is setting up equipment. Jack looks up at the sun thru an extra sunglasses lens. It is an uneven looking ball of gas. It kinda looks like the solar flare in 1969, but it's all over, not just in one place."
0,70,0,JACK,Is it suppossed to be doing that?
0,70,0,SAM,It's a coronal mass emmision. Like a solar flare.
0,70,0,JACK,"But it's safe, right?"
0,70,0,SAM,"That's what this equipment is designed to find out. Apart from disrupting the planet's magnetic field, it might cause a significant increase in surface radiation."
0,70,0,JACK,"But it's Safe, right?"
0,70,0,SAM,"As long as we don't stay here too long, yes, Sir."
0,70,0,JACK,Anyone explain that to Daniel?
0,70,2,DANNY,"I've encountered this script before. It's simular in pronounciation to a language on our planet called latin. Now, as near as I can tell the main body of the text represents some kind of planetary history."
0,70,2,DANNY,What I don't understand is the signifigance of this ... some kind of control mecognism. It's obviously in working order compared with the rest of the ruins. I wonder if that's significant.
0,70,3,AG,"The storm is approaching, Doctor Jackson. The radiation may be dangerous for you and your team."
0,70,3,DANNY,
0,70,3,AG,Concurer of time?
0,70,3,DANNY,In this context it seems more like Master of the uncertain past.
0,70,3,AG,"You're a skilled lenguist, Doctor Jackson."
0,70,3,DANNY,
0,70,4,DANNY,What's that?
0,70,4,AG,The geomagnetic desturbance is reaching its peak. I have to act now.
0,70,5,DANNY,I don't understand.
0,70,6,SAM,"All set up, Sir."
0,70,6,JACK,Good. Let's hit it! *into 2 way radio* Daniel! Let's go home. *no responce* Daniel?!
0,70,7,TEAL'C,O'Neill ...
0,70,7,JACK,"Yeah, I hear it."
0,70,9,TECHNITIAN,Incoming wormhole.
0,70,11,TECH,"I have no idea , Sir."
0,70,11,JACK,Are you doing this?
0,70,11,STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!,
0,70,11,SAM,Daniel?
0,70,11,JACK,What the hell are you doing?
0,70,11,AG,Stay Back!!!!
0,70,12,SAM,
0,70,15,DANNY,"...Anyway, I'm sorry. But that just happens to be the way I feel about it ... What do you think?"
0,70,16,JACK,What?
0,70,16,DANNY,What do you think?
0,70,17,SAM,Colonel? Is something wrong?
0,70,17,JACK,Maybe.
0,70,18,JACK,Weren't we just somewhere else?
0,70,19,DANNY,Where?
0,70,19,JACK,Some planet.
0,70,19,DANNY,When?
0,70,19,JACK,Just now.
0,70,19,DANNY,No.
0,70,19,JACK,Ya sure?
0,70,19,DANNY,Yeah.
0,70,20,JACK,Everything just changed....
0,70,20,SAM,"Sir, we have been sitting in the commensary for the last half hour."
0,70,20,JACK,Really?
0,70,20,DANNY,Although it is understandable how you could have gotten the two places confused.
0,70,21,SAM,We're gonna be late for the briefing.
0,70,21,JACK,Briefing?
0,70,21,DANNY,"Are you OK, or are you just avoiding answering my question?"
0,70,21,JACK,I'm fine. *A few second later* What question?
0,70,22,SAM,"Two weeks ago, SG-15 took these images of solar activities on P4X-639. Anylisis of the data indicates a steady increase in intencity. Now, if I'm right, the explosions are just a percurser from an even greater violent ejectory."
0,70,23,TEAL'C,MajorCarter. Have we not previously been briefed concerning this matter?
0,70,23,JACK,I was just gonna say that.
0,70,23,SAM,Sir?
0,70,23,JACK,You wanna go to the planet set up some kind of remote obseratory.
0,70,23,SAM,Yes.
0,70,23,JACK,We just did that.
0,70,23,DANNY,No we didn't.
0,70,23,TEAL'C,"I believe we did, DanielJackson."
0,70,23,GH,"No, Teal'C. That's what this briefing is about."
0,70,23,JACK,I distinctly remember sitting here listening to Carter prattle on about solar activity and a ... corona ... something.
0,70,23,SAM,Coronal Mass emmision. I was just about to bring it up.
0,70,23,JACK,There you go. How would I know that?
0,70,23,SAM,Mabe you read my report?
0,70,23,DANNY,(Adoringly skeptical
0,70,23,JACK,"I'm telling you guys, we've done this before."
0,70,23,TEAL'C,I am in agreement with O'Neill. I am experiencing a great deal of familiarity with these event.
0,70,24,(OVER PA) TECH,"Unscheduled off world activation. We have an unschdules incoming traveler, Sir."
0,70,24,JACK,It's SG-12.
0,70,24,GH,They're not due back for days.
0,70,24,TECH,Recieving GDO transmission. It's SG-12.
0,70,25,GH,Open the iris.
0,70,25,TEAL'C,One of them will be injured.
0,70,27,GH,"What do you make of all this, Major?"
0,70,27,SAM,"Well, Sir. I'm not sure."
0,70,27,GH,SG-12's early return was the result of an accident. One of the team fell and broke his ankle. How could Teal'C & Colonel O'Neill have known that was going to happen?
0,70,27,SAM,Both of them claim to have momories of SG-1's mission to P4X-639.
0,70,27,GH,A mission that isn't scheduled to start for another six hours.
0,70,29,DANNY,
0,70,29,JACK,You were by the alter deal with the guy.
0,70,29,DANNY,Right. Yo ... You're gonna have to be a little bit more spacific.
0,70,29,TEAL'C,Malikai.
0,70,29,DANNY,That 's the alien archiologist SG-15 met on the first survey. I was looking forward to meeting him.
0,70,29,JACK,"You did! ... You got along swell. Anyway, at some point, a beam shot out from the alter and hit the stargate."
0,70,29,TEAL'C,There was a blinding flash of light.
0,70,29,JACK,And then I was back in the commensary eating my froot loops.
0,70,30,JANET,"Well, Sir. I can't find anything wrong with either one of them. We'll have to wait for the lab results to be sure, but they both appear to be in perfect health."
0,70,30,SAM,Except for the facts they're remembering events that haven't even happened yet.
0,70,30,DANNY,"But why Jack & Teal'C, and not us?"
0,70,30,GH,"I'm not taking any chances. Until we figure out what's going on, I'm postponing your mission to P4X-639."
0,70,31,DANNY,"Jack! Wait up! Um ... I was thinking about what you said about a beam coming out of the alter. Uh ... SG-15 took digital images of the carvings in the ruins. I was thinking there is a clue in here as to what's going on, but it's the equivilent of about 400 pages of alien text. But uh ... if you can give me more details about the ... ruins ... it might be easier to ..."
0,70,32,SILER,"Gee, sorry, Doctor Jackson."
0,70,33,JACK,Shoulda seen that commin'.
0,70,34,SAM,So ...
0,70,34,JACK,So?
0,70,34,SAM,Don't ya know what I'm gonna say?
0,70,34,JACK,"Actually, by this time, we were on the planet. It's all different now."
0,70,34,SAM,
0,70,34,JACK,What about it?
0,70,34,SAM,"After the flash, You found yourself back here, and then you were basically reliving the moments up to the mission. Maybe, you're not remembering future events. Maybe you were sent back in time."
0,70,34,JACK,For what? Six hours?
0,70,34,SAM,It wouldn't be the first time we've seen something like this. The stargate did send us back to 1969.
0,70,34,JACK,Good year.
0,70,34,SAM,"So, I was wondering, could this beam you mentioned be a means to access the gate's subspace field in order to create some kind of timing version of side of subspace? (AQ's personal note: HUH?!?!?!"
0,70,34,JACK,I knew you were gonna say that.
0,70,34,SAM,I guess I'm just thinking out loud. I'm gonna go run a few simulations.
0,70,34,JACK,*Sarcastically* You run ... simulate. *Drinks coffee* Let me know how it turns out. Keep me posted. *To himself* Keep me aprized. *He sighs & closes his eyes.*
0,70,34,HAMMOND,The lab results confirm Dr Frasier's original assessments. You're both in perfect health. Any more of these premonitions?
0,70,34,TEAL'C,Not for some time.
0,70,34,O'NEILL,Can we go back to work now General please?
0,70,34,HAMMOND,I have no objection as long as.
0,70,35,GH,What is that?
0,70,35,TEAH,"I'm not sure, Sir. I've never seen anything like it."
0,70,35,JACK,*He and Teal'C are standing behind Tech* We have!
0,70,36,DANNY,Anyway I'm sorry but that just happens to be how I feel about it. What do you think?
0,70,37,SAM,"Colonel, is something wrong?"
0,70,37,JACK,"Oh, yeah! Something."
0,70,39,SAM,"2 weeks ago, SG-15 ..."
0,70,39,JACK,We've done this!
0,70,39,DANNY,We do this every day.
0,70,39,JACK,"I'm not talking about briefings in general, Daniel. I'm talking about THIS briefing! I'm talking about THIS DAY!"
0,70,40,TEAL'C,Colonel O'Neill is correct. Events do appear to be repeating themselves.
0,70,40,DANNY,Since when?
0,70,40,JACK,Since we went to P4X-639.
0,70,40,SAM,We haven't been to P4X-639.
0,70,40,JACK,"Yes we have. ""No, we haven't!"" That's what you were gonna say."
0,70,40,DANNY,"Of course, that's what I was gonna say."
0,70,40,JACK,
0,70,40,HAMMOND,Colonel I'm not sure what to make of all of this.
0,70,40,CARTER,If we've had this meeting before sir.
0,70,40,O'NEILL,"Why are TEAL'C and I the only ones who remember it? I know, that's what you said last time. Well I'll venture a guess that it has something to do with that planet. and You'll all believe me when SG-12 comes thru that gate in ... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... *He points his finger*"
0,70,40,GH,
0,70,40,TECH,Unscheduled offworld activation.
0,70,40,JACK,So close!
0,70,41,JACK,You're not gonna find anything.
0,70,41,FRASIER,Why don't we wait for the lab results before we jump to any conclusions.
0,70,41,TEAL'C,The results will be negative.
0,70,41,FRASIER,Humor me.
0,70,41,DANIEL,"Jack wait up. . Err. I was thinking about what you said about a beam coming from the altar. JACK: Four hundred pages of alien text. DANIEL : Right, SG15 took digital images of the carvings on the ruins."
0,70,41,JACK,Looks familiar.
0,70,41,DANIEL,"It should, it's something that you spoke for a few days. It's a variation of the writings used by the ancients."
0,70,41,JACK,Well if you're looking for help translating it you're barking up the wrong genius. .
0,70,41,DANNY,"No I realized that the Asgards returned you to normal, which is.fortunate I suppose. But err if you could give me more details about the layout of the ruins it might be useful. Sgt Siler again comes jogging around the corner and runs straight into Danny knocking him to the floor. All of the images scatter everywhere."
0,70,41,SILER,Gee sorry Dr Jackson. SILER and another airman help Daniel to his feet.
0,70,41,O'NEILL,Ooops.
0,70,42,HAMMOND,Come in. They enter the office. Hammond is sat at his desk.
0,70,42,JACK,Any word from Frasier?
0,70,42,HAMMOND,She's still waiting for the lab result.
0,70,42,TEAL'C,If we delay any longer it will be too late.
0,70,42,HAMMOND,Too late for what?
0,70,42,JACK,To stop this day from happening again!
0,70,42,HAMMOND,You realize that this is a little difficult for me to accept.
0,70,42,JACK,"Hey! If it was just me, I'd say yeah. But what about Teal'C? Does this look like the face of a crazy man?"
0,70,42,HAMMOND,What do you want?
0,70,42,JACK,We wanna go back to 639.
0,70,43,SAM,"A geomagnetic storm is building up, we shouldn't stay long."
0,70,43,JACK,That's the machine right there. They walk towards the pedestal.
0,70,43,SAM,I wonder how it works?
0,70,43,JACK,Subspace fields and time inversions. It's what you said. They see AG and Jack aims his weapon at him followed by Sam.
0,70,43,AG,Hello. (He raises his arms in the air.
0,70,43,DANIEL,"Woah, easy guys!"
0,70,43,JACK,"That's the guy, that's the one who started all this."
0,70,43,AG,I don't understand.
0,70,43,JACK,Whatever you did I want you to undo it.
0,70,43,AG,I did nothing!
0,70,43,SAM,Colonel I don't think he knows what you're talking about.
0,70,43,TEAL'C,Perhaps he has no memory O'Neill.
0,70,43,JACK,Oh he remembers. He's the one who was pushing all of those buttons. AG: Please I'm an archaeologist. I've been trying to translate these alien symbols. I.I told the others that came before you.
0,70,43,SG15?,
0,70,43,AG,"Yes, but they didn't point weapons at me. I can show you my notes. I've been making periodic visits to this planet for some time now. My research is almost complete. O'NEILL searches through MALAKI'S bag. He finds the weapon."
0,70,43,JACK,What kind of archiologist carries a weapon?
0,70,43,DANNY,Uh ... I do!
0,70,43,JACK,
0,70,43,AG,"If you must know, it's my wife."
0,70,44,JACK,What'd you do?
0,70,44,SAM,I didn't do anything! It engaged on its own.
0,70,44,JACK,Turn it off.
0,70,44,SAM,How?
0,70,44,AG,It's drawing energy from the ionization in the atmosphere. There's nothing MAJOR CARTER can do!
0,70,44,JACK,Excuse me? How'd you know her name?
0,70,44,AG,You told me.
0,70,44,JACK,"No, I didn't. Not this time around."
0,70,44,AG,It doesn't matter. You're too late.
0,70,44,JACK,How do you shut this thing off?
0,70,45,AG,Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you.
0,70,45,SAM,"Sir, it's building up some kind of charge."
0,70,45,JACK,"Daniel, you know how to read this stuff. Get up here and shut it off."
0,70,45,DANIEL,"What? Are you kidding me? I wouldn't even know where to begin, I mean it would take years to translate. I don't even have enough. The energy build up, the Stargate activates and they are enveloped in a blinding light. We next see."
0,70,45,DANIEL,Anyway I'm sorry but that just happens to be how I feel about it. What do you think? It was just a question.
0,70,46,JACK,"All right, here's the deal. We're all stuck in a time loop of some kind. However TEAL'C and I seem to be the only one's who realize it. Now there's this alien device on six thirty nine. It shoots a beam at the Stargate which.err subspace something. What?"
0,70,47,TEAL'C,Accesses the subspace field the Stargate is capable of generating. It is powered by ionization.
0,70,47,O'NEILL,"In the atmosphere, right. Which is caused by. I know this one. Magnets!"
0,70,47,TEAL'C,The geomagnetic storm.
0,70,47,JACK,Of course. Anyway I don't know why none of you don't remember this. But I do know for a fact there's no point in having old doc FRASIER examining us again!
0,70,48,JACK,I ask you ... what could possibly be in my eye to explain this.
0,70,50,HAMMOND,What do you make of all this?
0,70,50,SAM,"Well sir, when was the last time you heard Colonel O'Neill use terms like subspace field and geomagnetic storm?"
0,70,50,HAMMOND,Good point.
0,70,50,SAM,And he actually used them correctly.for the most part.
0,70,50,HAMMOND,You believe him?
0,70,50,SAM,"Well I'm considering the possibility sir. I mean the more I think about it, if he's right the ramifications are huge."
0,70,50,HAMMOND,And the next time loops we'll forget this conversation even happened.
0,70,50,SAM,Yes sir.
0,70,51,JACK,You're better off in here.
0,70,51,DANNY,I was just going look for you.
0,70,51,JACK,I know.
0,70,51,DANNY,Err.I've managed to translate a section of the west wall. It appears to be some sort of planetary history.
0,70,51,JACK,"Daniel, that's very nice, but focus on the altar."
0,70,52,TEAL'C,"Malaki initiated the time loop by manipulating the symbols on the surface. JACK Figure out the symbols, figure out how to stop this!"
0,70,52,DANIEL,Just because someone can recognize symbols on a keyboard doesn't mean they can run a computer. If I can translate the rest of the text I can put the device in a proper context and figure out what it's supposed to do.
0,70,53,DANIEL,Err.Think about it. Who would build a device that loops time every ten hours?
0,70,53,JACK,Who knows? But that's what it does.
0,70,53,DANIEL,Yes but maybe that's not what it's supposed to do. I mean for all we know that's just an accidental by-product of its true function. We're on our way. Sam has something. BRIEFING ROOM We see a schematic of a galaxy on the computer screen and Sam steps forward to begin talking to Hammond and the rest of SG1.
0,70,53,SAM,According to Colonel O'Neill in the first loop he and Teal'C witnessed a beam striking the Stargate on P4X 639. Then the gate became energized somehow. But now in the second loop at the exact same moment they witnessed a similar effect in our own gate room here on Earth.
0,70,53,O'NEILL,Sounds about right.
0,70,53,SAM,Ok so if we really under the influence of an alien technology then the effect is clearly being translated to Earth via the Stargate. In which case the solution is simple.
0,70,54,DANIEL,We dial out.
0,70,54,SAM,"Exactly, a few minutes before this is set to begin again we establish an outgoing wormhole to I don't know.say the Tollan home world and anyone or anything trying to dial in from P4X 639 will get a busy signal."
0,70,54,HAMMOND(NODS),"Let's do it. GATE ROOM The gate is dialing out. Base alarms are going off. CONTROL ROOM We see SG1, Hammond and a technician gathered around the console."
0,70,54,TECHNICIAN,Chevron five locked. Chevron six locked. Chevron seven will not engage.
0,70,54,CARTER (SURPRISED),What?
0,70,54,TECHNICIAN,It won't lock. I can't establish a connection.
0,70,54,CARTER,I'm running a diagnostic.
0,70,55,TECHNICIAN,Incoming wormhole.
0,70,55,HAMMOND,Close the iris. The iris closes. We see armed guards take up position in front of the gate.
0,70,55,JACK,Oh crap!
0,70,55,CARTER,"This doesn't make any sense, there's nothing wrong on our end. We should have been able to dial out. The gate opens and we see the arcing energy again. Carter looks to Jack who just waves his hand as the light engulfs them all and the loop starts again."
0,70,56,DANIEL,Anyway I'm sorry but that just happens to be how I feel about it. What do you think? Jack just puts his spoon down and sits back in his chair.
0,70,56,JACK,Ask me tommorrow.
0,70,58,JACK,"We've been over this! I'm telling you, the only way to stop this loop .is to figure out how to run that stuff. DANIEL: If we really have had this conversation before then I probably pointed it out to you that there's no way I can translate this entire text in less than a day."
0,70,58,JACK,I'm a step ahead of ya ... I put the whole thing on tape last time. So you don't have to start from scratch.
0,70,59,DANNY,"If what you say is true, then when loop started again ... you recording wouldn've happened yet."
0,70,59,JACK,*Quietly* Yeah ... right.
0,70,59,TEAL'C,Did I not say your plan would be unsucessful?
0,70,59,JACK,Careful! *quieter* Be careful. What about notes? Indulable ink?
0,70,60,DANIEL,Look if you guys are the only ones with memories of previous loops then you're gonna have to help me by learning and remembering.
0,70,60,JACK,Fine. How hard can this be?
0,70,62,HAMMOND,"What about SG12, they managed to gate in?"
0,70,62,CARTER,"I realize that, so we ran a sequence of random dialings and this is what we found. These were the worlds we were able to contact, including Alaris, the planet where SG12 were doing its survey. At the center of this group is P4X 639. I believe that the alien device is establishing a simultaneous connection with all of these gates creating a kind of subspace bubble and that everything within the bubble is cut off from the normal flow of time."
0,70,62,HAMMOND,What are the implications of this?
0,70,62,CARTER,"Well sir, we could be reliving the same day over and over maybe thousands of times and we'd never know it."
0,70,62,HAMMOND,What can we do?
0,70,62,CARTER,Unfortunately not much. By the next time this loop starts we won't even remember we had this conversation. It's up to Teal'C and Colonel O'Neill. DANIELS OFFICE We see Jack looking bored and reading a book entitled 'Latin for the novice' by Joseph Mallozzi PhD. Teal'C is next to him also studying.
0,70,62,JACK,"Potteramous, pottera, protarat, cram, eras, crat, cramus. We see Danny writing on a chalkboard translating some of the text. Jack puts the book down and puts his hands up to his head."
0,70,62,JACK,This is a bad idea.
0,70,62,TEAL'C,It would appear we have no choice.
0,70,63,JACK,"*Sighs* You know the worse part of this? Everytime we loop, Daniel askes me a question and ... I wasn't listening the first time."
0,70,63,TEAL'C,"You are not the only one who must endure some discomfort, O'Neill."
0,70,64,GEEK,"Sorry, Sir. I didn't realize you were there."
0,70,64,TEAL'C,"You have said that on many occasions. *Geek studders I, I* Perhaps next time I will not be so forgiving."
0,70,65,DANNY,Section twenty three ends with a reference to perennial inventus.
0,70,66,JACK,We've been over this.
0,70,66,TEAL'C,I believe it means the aproaching disaster.
0,70,67,DANNY,The machine surrenders ...
0,70,67,TEAL'C,"That is incorrect, DanielJackson."
0,70,67,JACK,"The word abiceerum Means give up, not surrender."
0,70,68,DANIEL,"Ok, this section of the text seems to deal primarily with their arrival on"
0,70,68,DANNY,"Ok, now this section of the text seems to deal primarily with their arrival on P4X 639 Now this word here, deductavum is a derivation of devuctum."
0,70,69,DANNY,"Ok, this section of the text seems to deal primarily with their arrival on"
0,70,70,DANNY,.Appears to be a reference to the gradual degeneration of the machine itself.
0,70,71,DANNY,".Foundation of a colony. Guys, you getting this? Because this is important."
0,70,73,TEAL'C,O'Neill? Should we not be assisting DanielJackson with the translation?
0,70,73,JACK,"I'm taking this loop off. *He put 2 blobs of ketsup on the plate.* I'm tellin' ya, Teal'C, If we don't find a way out of this soon, I'm gonna loose it. *Teal'C cocks his head looking confused* Lose it? It means go crazy ... nuts ... insane ... Bonzo ... *He's putting more ketchup and mustard on the plate as he's talking* No longer in possession of one's faculties ... Three fries short of a Happy Meal ... WACKO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *He shows Teal'C the smiley face he drew on the plate*"
0,70,74,JACK,*sigh* Teal'C?
0,70,74,TEAL'C,Thank you O'Neill. *Teal'C stands up and walks toward the board.*
0,70,74,JACK,"No, No. Thank YOU, Teal'C."
0,70,75,OH ... GOD!!!!,
0,70,75,DANNY,Exactly how many of these loops have you ... we ... been ... thru?
0,70,75,JACK,I've ... lost track.
0,70,75,DANNY,That must be frustrating.
0,70,75,JACK,Uh ... yeah! *Said sarcastically*
0,70,75,DANNY,"On the other hand, it's kind of an oppertunity."
0,70,75,JACK,How's that?
0,70,75,DANNY,"Well, think about it. If you know in advance that everything will be going back to the way it was, then ... you could do anything ... For as long as you want without having to worry about consequences!"
0,70,76,JACK,*Standing up* Excuse me. *Jack and Teal'C run out the door.*
0,70,78,JACK,"Hi, Bert. How are you? *To an airman*"
0,70,78,AIRMAN,I'm fine ... Sir.
0,70,79,JACK,"Yeah! Out a play. How far is Aloris, anyway? *Jack's teeing up.*"
0,70,79,TEAL'C,"Several billion miles, O'Neill."
0,70,79,JACK,That's gotta be a record.
0,70,82,GH,
0,70,82,JACK,(yelling back
0,70,83,GEEK,"I'm sorry, Sir. I didn't realize ..."
0,70,85,JACK,"Excuse me, George?"
0,70,86,GH,"Colonel, what are you doing out of uniform?"
0,70,86,JACK,"*Looking at his watch, and turning to Sam.* Handing you my resignation."
0,70,86,SAM,You're resigning?! What for?
0,70,86,JACK,*Still looking at his watch* So I can do ... this!
0,70,88,SAM,What are you smiling at?
0,70,89,JACK,Nothin'.
0,70,91,HAMMOND,What have you got for us Dr Jackson?
0,70,91,DANIEL,"Err.with the help of Teal'C and .Jack I've managed to complete the translation. As I originally suspected P4X 639 was once a colony of the Ancients. They thrived there for thousands of years until they were struck by some sort of unspecified cataclysm, perhaps a disease, but we'll never really know for sure. In any case facing certain destruction they built a time machine."
0,70,91,JACK,"They were going to go back and change their history, to avoid their fate."
0,70,91,DANIEL,"Right, but it didn't work. Instead of sending a team of scientists back to the key moment in their history the device caused a short term continuous loop. Just like the one we've been experiencing. They experienced the same day dozens perhaps hundreds of times trying to get the machine to work but in the end they gave up, they shut it down and.let the end come."
0,70,91,HAMMOND,So the loop can be broken? Jack nods silently at GH. DANIEL : Err.there's a section of text on the altar that deals specifically with the geomagnetic storms that power the device. Apparently they recur every fifty or so years which is why incidentally. JACK: Yes sir! The loop can be broken. He looks at Danny who has stopped talking.
0,70,91,DANIEL,I was getting to that. When we activate the symbols on the altar in the right sequence I think we can shut it down.
0,70,91,HAMMOND,Colonel have your team geared up and ready to embark in thirty minutes.
0,70,91,JACK,Yes sir! He gets up to leave. P4X 639 SG1 exit the Stargate. Sam reads her instruments.
0,70,91,JACK,The geomagnetic storms are building up. We shouldn't stay long. Lucky guess. . .
0,70,91,SAM,I don't see anyone sir.
0,70,91,JACK,"He's around here somewhere and he knows we're on to him. He gives a hand signal for them to pan out in their approach. Teal'C is looking around, and runs into a forse shiled. The FS knocks the big man backward onto the ground! He lands pretty hard! The AG knows that they're there to break the time loop , and he refuses to let them do that. TEAL'C"
0,70,91,TEAL'C!,
0,70,92,AG,I'm sorry but you've come to break the time loop and I'm afraid I can't let you do that. JACK: Get away from that thing! (He picks a stone up to throw at the barrier. He throws it but it just rebounds off quickly narrowly missing him and Danny.
0,70,92,SAM,It's no good sir. It looks like a variation of a Goa'uld force shield.
0,70,92,AG,"In fact it is Major. I had to trade several rare artifacts for the field generator but it was well worth it. DANIEL: Malaki, we have to reset those controls or the loop is going to restart itself again. AG: I'm counting on it. I need more time. Once I've correctly deciphered the symbols on the altar I will be able to master the time device. JACK: Why? So you can be the king of Groundhog Day?"
0,70,92,AG,You think i would do this for personal power? She ... You wouldn't understand.
0,70,92,JACK,What happened?
0,70,92,AG,"She died. 12 years ago. When I found this place, and discovered it's true purpose, I dedicated myself to unlocking it's mysteries."
0,70,93,SAM,So you can go back and save her?
0,70,93,AG,"No, that would be quite impossible. She died from a congentital heart weakness. Not even the ability to travel time could change that."
0,70,93,JACK,Then why are you doing this?
0,70,93,AG,To be with her once more.
0,70,93,DANNY,"*Takes off his glasses.* Malikai, the device doesn't work. It never did."
0,70,93,AG,It never did? You're living proof.
0,70,93,DANNY,"We finished translating the text on the ruins. The antients who built this place never got it to work. They tried over & over again, just like you, but in the end, they gave up. Why do you think this place has been deserted so long? They couldn't save themselves."
0,70,93,AG,You're wrong! There must be some other explination. I know I can make this work.
0,70,93,DANNY,"You can't. They proved it can't be done. You're just gonna go on like this forever, you'll be trapped."
0,70,93,TEAL'C,Along with billions of innocent others.
0,70,93,SAM,This device activated 14 stargates simultaniously. That's 14 worlds reliving the same day over & over.
0,70,93,AG,"I uh ... I didn't realize. But, It doesn't matter. Once I'm able to input the correct time corridinents, The cycle will be broken."
0,70,93,JACK,"The people who made that machine, are the same people who made the stargates, and they couldn't get the damn thing to work, and even if you could, just for the sake of arguing, You can't change what happened."
0,70,93,AG,I can ... touch her face again. Talk with her. Hear her laugh ...
0,70,93,JACK,Like you remember?
0,70,93,AG,Yes.
0,70,93,JACK,"Then what? Listen to me, I know what it's like!"
0,70,93,AG,*Yelling over the lightning and wind*
0,70,93,JACK,
0,70,94,JACK,And as much as I ... *Calmer now* I could never live that over again. Could you?
0,70,94,AG,*Tearfully* No.
0,70,94,JACK,Let her go.
0,70,96,GH,"Well, if we're still here Colonel, I guess you were sucessful."
0,70,96,JACK,"Well, General, you know what they say, if at first you don't succeed, TRY ... try ... try ... try, try, try, ... ah ... try again!"
0,70,97,JACK,mmn!
0,70,97,DANNY,I've never seen anybody enjoy oatmeal so much.
0,70,97,JACK,"When you've been eating froot loops for who knows how long, a little variety helps."
0,70,97,SAM,"Well, we got a message from the Tok'Ra. Apparently, they've been trying to contact us for over 3 months."
0,70,97,JACK,Really?
0,70,97,SAM,"Who knows when they first realized that we were cut off. I mean, there's really no way of telling how much time passed."
0,70,97,DANNY,"Let me ask you something, in all the time you were ... um ... looping, were you ever tempted to ... uh ... um ... do something crazy? I mean, you could do anything without worrying about consequences."
0,70,98,JACK,"You know, it's funny, you've asked me that before."
0,70,98,DANNY,And?
