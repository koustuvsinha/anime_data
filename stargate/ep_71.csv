0,71,0,STARGATE SG1,Episode 407
0,71,0,"""WATERGATE""",By Robert C. Cooper SG-1 is walking down the hall headed to the gateroom.
0,71,0,SAM,All indications suggest a positive environment.
0,71,0,JACK,Sounds good.
0,71,0,DANNY,It's gonna take us 2 weeks to get the enkarons fully transplanted.
0,71,0,TEAL'C,If the plan proves to be sutiable.
0,71,0,DANNY,It better be. They're running out of time.
0,71,1,DAVIS,Chevron 7 won't engage.
0,71,2,DAVIS,I don't understand it. The diagnostic shows no problems.
0,71,3,SAM,"Sir, this is gonna take a while."
0,71,4,SAM,It looks like there was an energy spike in our powerlog about 8 minutes before we first tried dialing out.
0,71,4,DANNY,"Uh ... Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that something we see when another gate is being used on earth?"
0,71,4,JACK,Like when Mayborne's N.I.D. guys had the other gate.
0,71,4,TEAL'C,There is no longer a second stargate on earth.
0,71,4,GH,Ours was destroyed along with Thor's ship.
0,71,4,SAM,"But if it was another gate, and it was responsible for the energy spike, they would have a seismic trimmer like when the gate was found in Antartica."
0,71,4,DAVIS,I've got something.
0,71,4,SAM,There was a seismic event that matches our time in the powerlog exactly.
0,71,4,JACK,Is that Siberia?
0,71,4,SAM,"Yes, Sir. And there's only one explination I can think of."
0,71,4,DANNY,The Russians have a stargate?
0,71,4,GH,The Russians recovered the stargate from the bottom of the ocean.
0,71,4,JACK,I thought we swept that entire area?
0,71,4,GH,"We're talking about hundreds of square miles, Colonel. The Russian Navy was on alert because they spotted Thor's ship. They must have gotten lucky and beat us to it."
0,71,4,SAM,And they admit it?
0,71,5,DANNY,"That doesn't make any sence, I mean shouldn't it eventually shut down on it's own?"
0,71,5,TEAL'C,The Goa'Uld themselves have not been able to establish a wormhole for longer that 38 minutes.
0,71,5,JACK,What about another black-hole planet?
0,71,5,SAM,"We would detect the gravitational anomolies, Sir."
0,71,6,JACK,And now?
0,71,6,GH,One of the Russian Scientist convinced them to send in a team to see if it could be resolved in another way.
0,71,6,SAM,Who's the scientist?
0,71,6,GH,Doctor Svetlana Markov.
0,71,6,SAM,Wow! I know her work! She's brillient.
0,71,6,GH,"She knows of you, too, MAjor. She's convinced Moscow to let SG-1 go to Siberia."
0,71,6,JACK,You're kidding.
0,71,6,GH,"Jack, They are smart enough to realize that this has global implications, and SG-1 is the most experienced with the stargate."
0,71,6,JACK,"General, we're gonna walk into an unknown situation to save their rosey butts."
0,71,6,DANNY,"JAck, we can't use our gate until we get their's shut down."
0,71,6,SAM,Then there's the potential danger of having an open wormhole between Earth and who knows where.
0,71,8,JACK,"Doctor Markov, I presume."
0,71,8,SAM,It's an honor ... I've read your work.
0,71,8,DM,"I've also read yours, Major Carter. Wish we had met under different circumstances."
0,71,8,JACK,Jack O'Neill.
0,71,8,DM,"Yes, and Doctor Daniel Jackson, and Teal'C."
0,71,9,SAM,How do you know about the SGC?
0,71,9,DM,I've read extensive files on all of you.
0,71,9,JACK,The question was HOW.
0,71,9,DM,"I learned to read English when I was six, it was not difficult."
0,71,10,JACK,Russian Humor.
0,71,10,DM,I will tell you what I can on the way.
0,71,13,JACK,"Alien space ship, huh?"
0,71,14,DM,You may be familiar with the incident.
0,71,14,JACK,Not a clue.
0,71,15,SAM,What stopped them?
0,71,15,DM,We activated our gate. I covinced them that we could benefit better from our own program better than we could trust the Americans.
0,71,15,JACK,Ah ...
0,71,15,DANNY,How did you activate it?
0,71,15,DM,We have a dialing device.
0,71,15,DANNY,The DHD. You found the one from Giza?
0,71,15,DM,It was confinscated from the Germans after the second world war.
0,71,15,SAM,"Now, I understand how you can send your people thru and get them to return thru your gate instead of ours."
0,71,15,JACK,That makes one of us.
0,71,15,DM,"Our gate superceded yours as long as the dialing device was connected to it. We only kept it connected when we were using it to prevent any crossovers. It required precise timing, but it worked."
0,71,15,JACK,Until now.
0,71,15,DM,"As for the current situation, I really don't know what has happened. There has been no contact with the base since yesterday @ 1200 hours."
0,71,15,CO-PILOT?,"Sir, we have a visual of the target runway. It appears to be iced over, and there's no responce from the control tower."
0,71,15,DM,We're going to have to jump.
0,71,15,DANNY,Out ... of ... the plane?!?!?!?
0,71,16,DM,"I'm going with or without you, Colonel."
0,71,16,JACK,*Said smartassed!* I suppose you expect my male bravada to kick in right about now.
0,71,16,DM,I've read your file.
0,71,16,JACK,"No mention of bravado, eh?"
0,71,16,DM,There are 47 people down there who may need our help.
0,71,16,JACK,"Look, You don't have to tell me what's at steak here. We've got 7 teams off world who can't get home until we fix what you screwed up."
0,71,17,JACK,*Into mic on helmet* Stu? Gear 'em up. We're jumpin'.
0,71,18,TEAL'C,"I do not understand, O'Neill."
0,71,18,JACK,It's called a parachute.
0,71,18,SAM,It slows your desent after you jump out of the plane.
0,71,18,TEAL'C,This device seams to be poorly designed to provide such a function.
0,71,18,JACK,It opens after you jump. *Teal'C just stares with the stoic face we all know and love!* Don't worry about it! I've done it hundreds of times.
0,71,18,DM,I assume you've brought the Haz-Mat?
0,71,18,JACK,Yeah. Thought somebody should be prepared.
0,71,18,DM,Is he ALWAYS like this?
0,71,18,SAM,"Actually, this is quite charming."
0,71,19,AIRMAN,"*Can't really hear him over engine noise* Field's ready, Sir!"
0,71,19,JACK,"*Yelling over engine noise* It's easy! Just jump, and pull this!"
0,71,19,TEAL'C,"This does not seam wise, O'Neill!"
0,71,19,JACK,I said it was easy ... not wise!
0,71,19,DM,"If we get seperated, we'll rondevous at the base!"
0,71,20,TEAL'C,This does not seam wise!!!!
0,71,22,JACK,
0,71,22,DM,Their signals may be blocked if they are already inside.
0,71,23,DM,Up there!
0,71,23,JACK,"*Over radio* Teal'C, Daniel? Do you read?"
0,71,23,TEAL'C,*Over radio* I am here.
0,71,23,JACK,Where?
0,71,23,TEAL'C,In the facility.
0,71,23,DANNY,"Yeah. I'm here, too."
0,71,23,JACK,Where?
0,71,23,DANNY,"Well, I don't know, exactly. Where are you?"
0,71,23,JACK,We just got inside. Hang tight.
0,71,24,SAM,I'm picking up trace amounts of chlorine.
0,71,24,JACK,Yeah?
0,71,24,SAM,"Nothing dangerous at these levels, Sir."
0,71,25,JACK,"Allright, what is this place?"
0,71,25,SAM,It obviously wasn't built spacifically for your stargate program.
0,71,25,DM,It was an experimental power station.
0,71,25,SAM,Experimental?
0,71,25,DM,All I'm allowed to say is it was decommisioned 2 years ago.
0,71,25,JACK,*Sarcastically* Please!
0,71,25,SAM,Are there lights?
0,71,25,DM,The power seems have been diverted from all nonessential base functions. This way to the main control center. Jack spots movement.
0,71,25,JACK,*Over radio* Daniel? Is that you?
0,71,25,DANNY,I don't know. I'm heading down a long corridor.
0,71,25,JACK,Which one?
0,71,26,DANNY,
0,71,26,DM,This way.
0,71,26,DANNY,"Actually, you might want to see this first."
0,71,27,TEAL'C,These three were shot. I am unaware how the others died.
0,71,27,DM,"These doors lead to the stargate. *DM punches in a code on the alarm thing, and passes a card.*"
0,71,28,DM,They're all dead.
0,71,29,DM,I need this station.
0,71,30,DM,It's safe.
0,71,31,TEAL'C,The air is indeed clean.
0,71,33,SAM,You OK?
0,71,33,DM,"I knew these men & women, Major. Some of them quite well."
0,71,33,JACK,"*Glances at Sam* So, what happened here?"
0,71,33,DM,Colonel Sokoluv enacted the extreme measures protocal.
0,71,33,DANNY,What's that?
0,71,33,DM,"The stargate room is sealed, and substance 35 is released throughout the base."
0,71,33,SAM,*Jack's beside her with a confused look on his face shaking his head.* Nerve gas?
0,71,33,JACK,Nerve gas?!?!?!
0,71,33,DM,"It's OK, Colonel. It's a nonpersistant gas. It evaporates after 3 hours. Acording to the computer, the protocal was enacted yesterday."
0,71,33,TEAL'C,For what reason?
0,71,33,DM,The computer log doesn't say.
0,71,33,JACK,"Alright , people were shooting each other around here before they got gassed. I want to know why."
0,71,33,DANNY,I'll see what I can find out.
0,71,34,JACK,"So, what about the gate?"
0,71,34,DM,"It's an outgoing wormhole, but ... it doesn't make sense! The EM protocal cuts off the dialing device. If the protocal was enacted yesterday, where has the out going wormhole been drawing it's power from since then?"
0,71,34,SAM,We've seen a one drawing power from the outgoing destination.
0,71,34,DM,"Of course, the black hole-incident."
0,71,35,JACK,Is there anything you don't know?
0,71,35,DM,*Confused* WHAT were they DOING?!?!?!?!?!?!
0,71,36,DM,It's GONE!
0,71,36,JACK,"If I ask WHAT, and you say it's classified, I'm gonna shoot you."
0,71,36,DM,"The seventh address we sucessfully dialed led to a stargate entirelly submerged underwater. We sent a recognesis, and found the dialing device. It was decided that the maned mini submarine would go next. A sample of the water was retrieved. It seemed to have unbelievable properties."
0,71,36,SAM,Like what?
0,71,36,DM,It was spontaniously emiting energy in the form of heat. If this liquid turned out to be an abundant clean energy source ...
0,71,36,SAM,That doesn't seem possible.
0,71,36,DM,I was called away to Moscow before I could preform any significant anylisis.
0,71,36,SAM,So now you're saying the water sample is gone?
0,71,36,DM,Yes. There was a sealed container here.
0,71,36,SAM,And the Stargate is connected to the water planet?
0,71,36,DM,"Apparently, but ... that doesn't make sense. They were supposed to continue on to the next 2 planets on our planned sequence, and NOT revisit the waterplanet until I got back!"
0,71,36,SAM,Let's confirm it. Do you have another recognasis craft?
0,71,36,DM,We left the first one there. All we have to do is reactivate it.
0,71,38,JACK,*Thru radio* Daniel? Teal'C?
0,71,38,DANNY,Uh ... What's up?
0,71,38,JACK,Head back to the control room. Doctor Markov thinks you might want to see this.
0,71,38,TEAL'C,Thusfar we have accounted for 28 of the 47 members on the list.
0,71,38,DANNY,"6 of them were dressed as civilians, not soldiers. They were shot, and there was no apparent reason why."
0,71,38,DM,They were the scientists working in the lab.
0,71,38,JACK,"So, the guys experiamenting on that water gave the soldiers reason to shoot them."
0,71,38,DM,So it seems.
0,71,38,DANNY,What water?
0,71,38,SAM,A sample brought back from where the stargate is submerged.
0,71,38,DM,"I thought you might be interested, Doctor Jackson. We found some unusual ruins of an obviously extinct civilization on the ocean floor."
0,71,39,DANNY,Can you get closer?
0,71,39,DM,The drone is malfunctioning. I can only pan and tilt.
0,71,40,TEAL'C,Why would those men proceed thru the stargate knowing that they would drown on the other side?
0,71,41,SAM,Can you shut off the drone's transmitter from here?
0,71,41,DM,Why?
0,71,41,SAM,"Well, even though the wormhole only allows matter to travel one way, we are able to send radio signals back and forth."
0,71,41,DM,You think the radio transmitter is what's keeping the gate open?
0,71,41,SAM,The gate won't close if the transmitter is sending a strong enough signal into the event horizon.
0,71,41,DM,The energy from the water is making the gate stay open this long.
0,71,41,SAM,Exactly. It's a combination of factors. All we have to do is shut off the drone.
0,71,41,DM,It's not responding to my command.
0,71,41,SAM,How long before it's batteries die?
0,71,41,DM,It's nuclear powered.
0,71,41,JACK,A nuclear powered drone?!?!?!?!
0,71,41,DM,We built several of them planning to leave them on other planets for long term observation.
0,71,41,SAM,
0,71,41,DM,*looks around* 10 years.
0,71,42,JACK,"*Sarcastically* Oh, Dang. I've never been in a submarine before."
0,71,43,DANNY,"Spacious ... roomy! Very nice. So, exactly how much air do we have in this thing?"
0,71,43,DM,Over a days worth. We won't need more than an hour.*Sam and Danny look at each other.*
0,71,43,DM,"*Over monitor* Colonel, can you hear us?"
0,71,43,JACK,"Yeah, I read ya."
0,71,43,DM,Pressurizing and ... proceding thru the gate.
0,71,44,JACK,Good luck.
0,71,44,SAM,Thank you.
0,71,45,WOW!,
0,71,45,DM,It is quite beautiful.
0,71,45,DANNY,What?
0,71,45,DM,"The rapid pressurrization might cause your ears to block. As you might notice, There is no plant or animal life."
0,71,45,DANNY,There doesn't appear to be plant or animal life.
0,71,45,SAM,"Colonel, do you read?"
0,71,45,JACK,Yeah?
0,71,45,DANNY,We're counting 5 bodies on this side.
0,71,45,TEAL'C,Several personnelle are unaccounted for.
0,71,45,JACK,"All right, we'll have another look around."
0,71,47,DM,"I'm glad you were right, Major."
0,71,48,DANNY,What's that smell?
0,71,48,DM,We've completely stopped ... *Explosion in back of them*
0,71,48,DANNY,Uh ... fire!
0,71,48,DM,Extinguisher!
0,71,49,DANNY,It's out! We're OK. *To DM who's at the burnt engine* Can you fix it?
0,71,49,DM,Yes.
0,71,49,DANNY,*To Sam who looks worried* What?
0,71,49,SAM,"If it was a strong current, it should be taking us backwards now."
0,71,49,DANNY,But it's not?
0,71,49,SAM,No. We're completely stationary. It's like we're stuck in the mud.
0,71,51,JACK,What's that smell?
0,71,53,JACK,Holy Frozen Bad Guys!
0,71,55,DANNY,How's it going?
0,71,55,DM,I think I can fix it.
0,71,55,DANNY,"Wait a minute, a few minutes ago you said you could definately fix it... now you THINK you can?"
0,71,55,DM,What do you want to hear? I don't understand why this happened.
0,71,55,DANNY,"Well, given the solid craftmanship that went into this thing, I don't see how this could POSSIBLY have happened."
0,71,55,DM,"If you're implying that everything Russian made is of poor quality, actually ... The sub is Swiss."
0,71,55,DANNY,"So they occasially catch fire, but they keep good time."
0,71,56,DANNY,Sorry. *To himself* I've been hanging around Jack O'Neill too much.
0,71,56,DM,There was nothing impeading us. It shouldn've happened.
0,71,56,SAM,Here's something else that shouldn't be happening. The outside pressure is increasing.
0,71,56,DM,
0,71,56,DANNY,But it's Swiss. LOL!
0,71,56,SAM,"Our depth is constant, and pressure should be relative to depth."
0,71,56,DANNY,And if it keeps increasing?
0,71,56,DM,The sub will implode.
0,71,58,TEAL'C,We now know how the Russians inquired the information.
0,71,59,JACK,Solid! LOL!
0,71,61,JACK,Whoa!
0,71,61,TEAL'C,Do not human usually die when they are frozen?
0,71,61,JACK,Usually.
0,71,62,JACK,They usually don't breathe when they're dead either.
0,71,63,DANNY,"So, Slavana, tell us exactly what happened the last time you were here."
0,71,63,DM,"We came thru the stargate just as you did this time. We took the sub straight to the dialing device and rediled earth. The gate opened, and we headed thru."
0,71,63,DANNY,That's it?
0,71,63,DM,We collected the water sample just before heading back thru the event horizon.
0,71,63,SAM,No trouble?
0,71,63,DM,"We had to push the engines a little harder to get thru the gate, but I suspected it was a countermeasure intended to keep the water from flowing thru the gate."
0,71,63,SAM,It's possible. My research indicated that the gate actually has the ability to use density & molecular structure and a forse being exerted on the event horizon to determine whether something is trying to pass thru.
0,71,63,DM,"I know, that's where I got the idea."
0,71,66,JACK,Maybourne?
0,71,66,TEAL'C,His heart is beating. Albeat slowly. He is getting warmer O'Neill.
0,71,66,JACK,Maybourne!?
0,71,67,JACK,Ya hear me?
0,71,69,DANNY,Or that!
0,71,70,DM,The front bubble will be the first to go.
0,71,70,DANNY,"Uh ... can we stop agreeing on how we're gonna die, and start doing something about it?"
0,71,72,JACK,"Allright, that's far enough. *Maybourne turns* Maybourne? *MB's walking out of the kitchen* MAYBOURNE! STOP!!!! *Teal'C blocks MB's path* Move again, and I'll shoot! *MB turns again to face Jack*"
0,71,73,JACK,Damn!
0,71,73,MB,Jack ... The freezer!
0,71,73,JACK,What?
0,71,73,MB,*Advancing towards Jack* Move if you want to live! *Jack puts his pistal in MB's face.* Shoot me if you want to! We're dead if we don't move NOW!!!!
0,71,74,JACK,Teal'C?
0,71,75,MB,
0,71,75,JACK,Get out of my way.
0,71,76,JACK,What the Hell is going on here?
0,71,78,MB,It's alive.
0,71,78,JACK,What?
0,71,78,MB,"The water. When they exposed it to the air to start a chemical analisis, it just evaporated. Turned into vapor."
0,71,78,JACK,You were there?
0,71,78,MB,We inhaled it. Didn't give us a choice.
0,71,78,JACK,Who's us?
0,71,78,MB,"The scientists and I. I knew what was going on, but I couldn't control myself. They wanted to go back thru the stargate."
0,71,78,JACK,Who's they?
0,71,78,MB,Lifeforms. In the water. Countless numbers of microscopic organisms. Intellegent lifeforms!
0,71,78,JACK,Are you trying to tell me this water thinks?
0,71,78,MB,"We were killing them They forsed us to take them back thru the gate. The soldiers tried to stop us. They were shooting. If an infected man was killed, the fluid came out of him and more were infected. It was chaoes. Only , the infected soldiers managed to get to the DHD, and get the gate open. That's when the base commander enacted the EM protochol to stop it! The infected men started running thru the gate, trying to escape the gas."
0,71,78,JACK,Why didn't you?
0,71,78,MB,I was cut off from the gateroom. I think the liquid organisms inside me knew the only way to keep themselves alive was to escape the gas and freeze themselves. So they forced me in here.
0,71,78,JACK,You were frozen solid when we found you.
0,71,78,MB,
0,71,78,JACK,How do you know all this?
0,71,78,MB,"I don't know how, exactly. I just do. They must have communicated it to me."
0,71,78,JACK,"This is the stuff that's in Teal'C now? *MB Nodds his head* How do we get it out? *MB Shakes his head* Come on, Maybourne! It came out of you!"
0,71,78,MB,They needed to go back. You wouldn't let me go. I guess they thought Teal'C could get them home.
0,71,79,DANNY,What if it's a lifeform?
0,71,79,DM,That is pure assumption.
0,71,79,DANNY,That may explain everything.
0,71,79,SAM,"After you collected the sample, you said there was resistance trying to go back thru the gate."
0,71,79,DANNY,"It wasn't the gate causing the resistance, it was the lifeform trying to prevent you from leaving."
0,71,79,SAM,"And now, it's precieving us as some kind of a threat."
0,71,82,JACK,"Teal'C! *Jack runs up behind the big Jaffa* TEAL'C!!!! *Jack tackles the big man to the ground* Fight it! FIGHT IT!!!! *Teal'C struggles with Jack, then throws him across the room.*"
0,71,85,DM,It's all we've got!
0,71,85,SAM,The pressure alone would ...
0,71,90,SAM,Daniel?
0,71,91,DM,What's are you doing? WHAT'S HE DOING?!?!?!?!
0,71,91,SAM,Daniel?!
0,71,91,DANNY,I think it just wants to understand!
0,71,91,DM,What?
0,71,91,DANNY,Us.
0,71,93,JACK,Teal'C?
0,71,93,TEAL'C,"They had no wish to kill me, O'Neill. They only wanted to travel home."
0,71,93,JACK,That's it? You all right?
0,71,93,TEAL'C,I will be.
0,71,94,JACK,
0,71,95,JACK,Ah! That had to hurt! *He and Teal'C walk over to the three.*
0,71,96,JACK,Didn't you guys leave here in a submarine?
0,71,97,SAM,We uh ...
0,71,97,DANNY,"Last thing I remember, we were being pulled into the ..."
0,71,98,SAM,"Not really sure what happened, Sir."
0,71,99,JACK,Here's a thought. We just exchanged hostiges. *Every one looks at each other confused.* It's just a thought.
