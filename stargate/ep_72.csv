0,72,0,"""THE FIRST ONES""","By Brad Wright Daniel and Rothman are digging at a site. They find a queen goa'uld that Rothman names Cleopatra , Cleo for short. This Goa'Uld has no naquada which is found in most Goa'Uld. Rothman sends Hawkins for a water run. Daniel calls Lodar over to help him archive their findings. As he's archiving, Lodar sees something charge for him and opens fire. The thing knocks Daniel down after killing Lodar. Someone yells Daniel's name as he's being dragged away uconscious."
0,72,1,TECH DAVIS,"Unscheduled offworld activation. It's SG-11, Sir."
0,72,1,GH,Open the iris.
0,72,1,DAVIS,"Yes, Sir."
0,72,2,SAM,"Daniel's with them, isn't he?"
0,72,2,GH,They're not scheduled to check in for 2 more days.
0,72,3,JACK,Daniel?
0,72,3,ROTHMAN,"No, No, No! It TOOK Daniel! That's why the others went after it!"
0,72,3,SAM,How long ago?
0,72,3,ROTHMAN,I don't know! Maybe 3 hours! Daniel? He's still alive! That thing was draggin him!!!!
0,72,3,JACK,You saw it?
0,72,3,ROTHMAN,Just for a second.
0,72,3,JACK,Request permission to lead Search and rescue.
0,72,3,ROTHMAN,"But if I had to guess, I'd say it was an Unas."
0,72,3,JACK,A what?!?!
0,72,3,ROTHMAN,It was like the thing in your mission report from Cimeria.
0,72,3,JACK,"Basically, we're talking about a Goa'Uld with teeth and claws, Sir."
0,72,3,TEAL'C,"Not necessarily, O'Neill."
0,72,3,SAM,Daniel believed that 888 was the planet from which all goa'uld symbiotes originated.
0,72,3,TEAL'C,There could be unas there who have never been taken as hosts.
0,72,3,JACK,"We're still talking about a big, stinky monster. Makes no difference."
0,72,3,TEAL'C,Indeed it does. These unas would be far more primative and lack the degenative powers than Unas we have previously encountered.
0,72,3,SAM,What would a primative unas want with Daniel.
0,72,3,JACK,"I recommend units 1&2, P90's. I also recommend we leave right now, Sir."
0,72,3,GH,You have a go.
0,72,5,NEXT SHOT,
0,72,5,JACK,"All right, listen up! We're a little pressed for time here, so this will have to serve as your mission briefing. Daniel Jackson has been dragged off by a creature called an UNAS! This is a search and rescue. Any questions?"
0,72,5,ROTHMAN,Uh . . . yes! I have one! When exactly were you gonna tell me we were leaving.
0,72,5,JACK,I wasn't.
0,72,5,OH!,
0,72,5,JACK,Move out.
0,72,6,NEXT SHOT,Unas with Daniel walking thru the forest.
0,72,6,DANIEL,"Okay, I know it seems completely unlikely for you to understand a word I'm saying, but, I've gone just as far as I can go at this particular pace, so with your permission, I'm gonna fall down now! Rest. This is something you should become familiar with. Rest . . . I means . . . Uh . . . REST . . . Close. Try again, though . . . .RRRRREST! This . . . this is uh . . . nothing that you need to be worried about. Radio. It's uh . . . so my friends can find me and shoot you. Uh, this is Daniel Jackson if anyone can hear me---"
0,72,7,DANIEL,
0,72,8,SAM,Sir!
0,72,8,JACK,Yeah?
0,72,8,SAM,"Fairly strong RDF signal. It's gone now, not long enough to triangulate."
0,72,8,ROTHMAN,"So, what, what's that mean?"
0,72,8,SAM,Daniel may have tried to use his radio.
0,72,8,SOLDIER,Could be SG-11.
0,72,8,SAM,
0,72,8,JACK,"Alright, let's pick it up."
0,72,9,DANNY,
0,72,9,UNAS,A'ka Cha . A'Ka Cha.
0,72,9,DANNY,A'Ka Cha'Ka?
0,72,10,DANNY,Chaka. Is that what you call yourself? Chaka? Daniel. I'm Daniel. Chaka something else? Chaka's the moons? This is some sort of moon chant? Moons coming into alignment? Moon chant. What was I thinking?
0,72,10,UNAS,"Shesh, shesh! SHESH!"
0,72,10,DANNY,Shesh? Shesh? What is that?
0,72,10,UNAS,Shaka kaka!
0,72,11,DANNY,
0,72,12,JACK,We're somewhere on your six. Do you read? Where the hell is Hawkins?
0,72,12,SAM,The UAV would have run out of fuel by now.
0,72,12,ROTHMAN,Maybe an unus got him.
0,72,13,DANNY,Hey! Water. I need water.
0,72,16,UNAS,Kaka! Kaka!
0,72,16,DANNY,Kaka? Kek . . . dead! Keka means dead? Danger? OK! Ka means no. Right. I won't do that again.
0,72,17,ROTHMAN,Loder was killed over there.
0,72,17,TEAL'C,He appears to have been killed by a being of great strength.
0,72,17,JACK,What was Loder doing?
0,72,17,ROTHMAN,Packing up fossilized Goa'Uld for transportation back to earth.
0,72,17,JACK,You guys weren't doing anything that would have provoked an attack?
0,72,17,ROTHMAN,
0,72,17,JACK,"You know Rothman, I'm so glad you came!"
0,72,17,ROTHMAN,
0,72,17,SOLDIER,Look at this! They got off a hell of a lot of shots.
0,72,19,JACK,Where's the rest of your men?
0,72,19,HAWKINS,We were attacked. Sanchez is dead for sure. I don't know what happened after that. We got split up. Some of them might have made it . . . back.
0,72,19,OH! GOD!,
0,72,19,SAM,"Major, we've been trying to contact you for the last few hours."
0,72,19,HAWKINS,"My men are dead, aren't they?"
0,72,19,JACK,"Look, Hawkins . . . I can't spare anybody to take you back to the stargate. You're gonna have ta stick with us. Can ya do that?"
0,72,19,HAWKINS,"What ever you say, Sir."
0,72,19,JACK,Let's move out.
0,72,21,SAM,"Sir, I think we should rest."
0,72,21,JACK,"Allright. Go to ground, boots on, no fire. I'll take first watch."
0,72,23,DANNY,Is this your cave? Your cave? It's nice.
0,72,23,UNAS,Nan!
0,72,23,DANNY,Nan? Nan is Goa'Uld? Is Symbiote? Nan?
0,72,23,UNAS,Ka! Nan.
0,72,23,DANNY,"Eat! Eat. Nan is eat! of course. No, NO! If I am the main course, I'd rather you fill up on the appetizers. So . . . Ka!"
0,72,23,UNAS,Throws head back) NAN!
0,72,24,DANNY,"Right! Uh, toss the symbiote head! That's very popular, very interesting! Yes, all the kids are doing this! Uh-Oh! Look out! In the fire, but . . . NAN!"
0,72,24,KA!,
0,72,24,DANNY,"Now, don't say KA till you've tried it! Nan."
0,72,24,MMMM ! MMMMMM!,
0,72,24,RRRRRRR,
0,72,24,DANNY,That's funny! I met my father in law like this.
0,72,24,RRRRR . . .,
0,72,24,DANNY,"Yeah, like that!"
0,72,25,JACK,Rothman!
0,72,25,ROTHMAN,What?! Colonel?!
0,72,25,JACK,You notice anything weird about Hawkins?
0,72,25,ROTHMAN,Weird?
0,72,25,JACK,Different.
0,72,25,ROTHMAN,Different.
0,72,25,JACK,Odd?
0,72,25,ROTHMAN,Odd?!
0,72,25,JACK,Rothman!
0,72,25,ROTHMAN,
0,72,25,JACK,"Well, you work with him. Tell me if you noticed any thing . . . out of the ordinary?"
0,72,25,ROTHMAN,"He seems like . . . Hawkins! I, I don . . . That's the way he is!"
0,72,25,JACK,Ya sure?
0,72,25,ROTHMAN,No. It's not my thing.
0,72,25,JACK,What isn't?
0,72,25,ROTHMAN,"People. I mean give me a million year old fossil, and I'll tell you what it had for breakfast, but I, I , I'm not too good with people. They're too recent."
0,72,26,DANNY,"I'm in a cave. There are crude drawings, pictigraphs. It really seams to have comprehention of Goa'Uld symbiote structure. As well as their ability to blend. Obviously the unas who were taken over must have figured out how to work the gate and left but . . . not all of them."
0,72,27,DANNY,I think I've just been marked for death!
0,72,28,SAM,"Teal'C, we're moving out."
0,72,29,TEAL'C,Come no closer!
0,72,29,JACK,What was that?
0,72,29,TEAL'C,Lower your weapons!
0,72,29,JACK,What?!
0,72,29,TEAL'C,One or more of you may have become hosts to a Goa'Uld during our watch.
0,72,30,SAM,"Teal'C, that doesn't make any sense! I don't sense . . ."
0,72,30,TEAL'C,Cause you yourself may have been compromised.
0,72,30,JACK,"Well, what makes you think there are Goa'Uld around here."
0,72,30,TEAL'C,These waters abound with them. Any one who have ventured to the edge has put them selves at risk.
0,72,30,ROTHMAN,"No, the Goa'Uld fossils we found are millions of years old. I've been on this planet for weeks."
0,72,30,TEAL'C,Then perhaps you maintained the pretence of being human.
0,72,30,ROTHMAN,I think I would know if there was a snake in my head!
0,72,30,JACK,Carter?
0,72,30,SAM,"I can't explain it, Sir. I don't even sense the ones that are in the water."
0,72,30,ROTHMAN,Daniel & I found no traces of Naquata in the symbiote fossil. Maybe that's why -
0,72,30,TEAL'C,Enough! Relinquish your weapons immediately!
0,72,30,SOLDIER,Hold on! How do we know YOU'RE not one of them?
0,72,30,SAM,Symbiotes can't blend with a Jaffa.
0,72,30,SOLDIER,"Yeah? Well, look at my neck. Do you see a scar?"
0,72,30,TEAL'C,A goauld may enter thru the mouth leaving no visible scar. Therefore it may be impossible to tell who among you has been taken and who has not.
0,72,30,SAM,"Sir, Teal'C is right. He's the only one we can be sure of, even you and me."
0,72,30,JACK,Do as he says. Everyone takes off their weapons.
0,72,30,SAM,What about Daniel?
0,72,30,TEAL'C,None of you can be trusted to proceed.
0,72,30,SOLDIER,You think you can bring Daniel back alone?
0,72,30,TEAL'C,"I do, and I will. Sargent Colburn."
0,72,30,COLBURN,Colburn?
0,72,30,TEAL'C,One or more of our team may have been compromised by a goa'uld parisite.
0,72,30,COLBURN,How many?
0,72,30,TEAL'C,"That may be impossible to detirmine. I intend to restrain them at this location, and continue on."
0,72,30,JACK,What?!
0,72,30,TEAL'C,I will leave this frequency open so that you may locate them and return to the SGC. Take extreme caution.
0,72,30,COLBURN,We're on our way.
0,72,30,TEAL'C,"Bind their hands and feet tight with those. I will then do the same to you, O'Neill."
0,72,32,JACK,"I'm telling you, It's gotta be Hawkins!"
0,72,32,TEAL'C,"Trust in me, O'Neill."
0,72,32,JACK,What if I'm not O'Neill?!
0,72,32,TEAL'C,Then I was not talking to you.
0,72,33,SOLDIER,What if one of those Unas come by? What will we do then?
0,72,33,SAM,"Teal'C didn't have any other choice, Captain."
0,72,35,ROTHMAN,This is ridiculous! I'm not a Goa'Uld!
0,72,35,JACK,"Well, then why didn't you say so? Could've straightened this whole thing out."
0,72,35,HAWKINS,"So, which one of you is it?"
0,72,35,JACK,All right anybody with a snake in their head raise their hands!
0,72,36,JACK,"Damn! Um . . . TEAL'C!!!! TEAL'C!!!!!!!!!!!!! TEAL'C!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TEAL'C!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, that took ya long enough!"
0,72,36,TEAL'C,"You are welcome, O'Neill. I knew if there was a Goa'Uld among you, he would be strong enough to free himself."
0,72,36,SAM,You had to wait long enough to make sure Hawkins was the only one.
0,72,36,TEAL'C,Yes.
0,72,36,SOLDIER,You satisfied now?
0,72,36,TEAL'C,I am.
0,72,36,ROTHMAN,Glad that's over with!
0,72,36,JACK,You gonna live?
0,72,36,SOLDIER,Yeah. I think so.
0,72,36,JACK,Meet up with Colburn. Head back to the stargate.
0,72,36,SOLDIER,Yeah. How long do you figure he's been Goa'Uld?
0,72,36,SECOND SOLDIER,"Could've been the whole time, we just didn't know it."
0,72,36,SAM,"They deserve a decent burial, Sir."
0,72,36,JACK,"Yes, they do."
0,72,36,SOLDIER,"We'll take care of it, Sir. Go find Doctor Jackson."
