0,74,0,"""BENEATH THE SURFACE""","By Heather E. Ash We begin with what can only be called ""Muscle-man's quarters"" . Buff men with bods like Teal'C are waking up. An Alarm sounds. Teal'C sits up, and looks around. He stands up and walks away. There's a lady there, too I just noticed. Lucky her! Shot goes up to a skylight then pans down a few levels to a gathering of people. A lady walks up to a platform."
0,74,0,LADY,"Collegues! You're attention, please! I'm pleased to report that thanks to your hard work, We now have enough reserve energy to heat the greenhouses for the next 2 months! Special merit to the workers of section 23. Our world may be covered in ice, but one day we will reclaim our place on the surface!"
0,74,0,ALL,
0,74,1,SAM,"Kegan, how about some bread?"
0,74,1,KEGAN,"Sorry, just gave away the last piece."
0,74,1,JACK,"Oh, here we go! Every time . . ."
0,74,1,SAM,What is your problem?
0,74,1,KEGAN,I don't have a problem!
0,74,1,SAM,And we don't have any bread.
0,74,1,DANNY,Is there a problem here?
0,74,1,JACK,Stay out of this.
0,74,1,DANNY,"Jona, there are other people waiting."
0,74,1,GIVE HER THE DAMN BREAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
0,74,1,LADY,Somebody stop them!
0,74,2,TEAL'C,"This is not right! The two of you are friends, O'Neill!"
0,74,2,JACK,Stay out of this!
0,74,2,TEAL'C,We are part of something called SG-1! I am Teal'C! Do you not remember?!
0,74,2,JACK,Somebody get this guy off me!
0,74,2,WOMAN FROM PLATFORM,Get him upstairs.
0,74,2,TEAL'C,We don't belong here! You must remember! We must escape!!!!
0,74,2,JACK,Brenna . . . It is my honor to serve. I don't know that man.
0,74,2,BRENNA,"I know, Jona, don't worry. He's nightsick. Give Therra her bread. Everyone finish, then back to work."
0,74,2,KEGAN,"These pumps regulate the overflow. Sometimes, they get clogged, and you have to . . . Carlin?!"
0,74,2,DANNY,Where has he been for the last 5 days?
0,74,2,KEGAN,"Recovering from Nightsickness. It's a strange thing. There was this guy once, a couple years ago, tried to smash his way thru one of those skylights."
0,74,2,DANNY,Did he do it?
0,74,2,KEGAN,You would have known if he had! This place would have been buried under snow and ice along with everyone else.
0,74,2,DANNY,Right.
0,74,3,MAN,Stay back.
0,74,3,SAM,Cover those valves!
0,74,3,BRENNA,What happened?
0,74,3,SAM,One of the stabilizers ruptured. They can't stand the pressure.
0,74,3,BRENNA,There's not much we could do.
0,74,3,SAM,"Actually, I think there is. If we set up an automatic release valve on each of the stabilizers, we could vent the excess pressure. I've done some calculations. If you want I could show you."
0,74,3,BRENNA,You can come by my office later.
0,74,5,JACK,You all right?
0,74,5,SAM,Fine.
0,74,5,JACK,That explosion . . .
0,74,5,SAM,
0,74,5,JACK,Good.
0,74,5,SAM,Brenna wants to see me. She wants to hear my ideas for improving the plant.
0,74,5,JACK,"You know, you could take a few minutes off."
0,74,5,SAM,Please. You work just as hard as I do.
0,74,5,JACK,"That's different. It's called ""stamina""."
0,74,5,SAM,Have a good shift.
0,74,5,JACK,Right . . .
0,74,5,KEGAN,There she goes. Why does Brenna listen to her?
0,74,5,DANNY,I don't know. She seems pretty smart.
0,74,5,KEGAN,She thinks she's better than the rest of us . . . They both do.
0,74,5,DANNY,Teal'C said we were friends.
0,74,5,KEGAN,His name's not Teal'C. It's Tor. Nightsickness.
0,74,6,TECH. DAVIS,"Sir, we're ready with the video link to P3R-118."
0,74,6,GH,Very well.
0,74,7,GH,Administrator Calder . . .
0,74,7,CALDER,"General Hammond. I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but our search has turned up nothing. Given the hostile conditions outside the dome, I don't see how SG-1 could have survived very long."
0,74,7,GH,"With all due respect, Administrator, I'm not ready to give up on my people just yet. We have specialized equipment, and people spacifically trained for this type of operation."
0,74,7,CALDER,"When Major Carter first expressed an interest in exploring the glacier, I tried to explain the danger, but Colonel O'Neill was quite overly confident that they could handle the conditions."
0,74,7,GH,"I appreciate your concern. I assure you, I will take full responsibility."
0,74,7,CALDER,Very well. Tell Brenna I want to see her tomorrow. I'd like to know how our new workers are doing.
0,74,8,JACK,Go ahead.
0,74,8,DANNY,Go Where?
0,74,8,JACK,To the other side.
0,74,8,KEGAN,Don't listen to him.
0,74,9,GH,"Major, What's your Status?"
0,74,9,MAJOR,"We've launched the UAV, we're receiving telemetry now! But I have to tell you, Sir. It doesn't look good! This place is pretty nasty!"
0,74,10,DANNY,What happened?
0,74,10,TEAL'C,I was injured.
0,74,10,DANNY,When?
0,74,10,TEAL'C,Why are you speaking to me?
0,74,10,DANNY,"I just thought . . . since, apparently, we're friends from way back, I just though that . . . what is that THING on your forehead?"
0,74,10,TEAL'C,A birthmark.
0,74,10,DANNY,A birthmark! You'd think I'd remember something like that.
0,74,10,TEAL'C,I don't know you.
0,74,10,DANNY,You said you did . . . Last week during morning lineup.
0,74,10,TEAL'C,I wasn't here last week.
0,74,10,DANNY,"You said we were friends, and you said we had to escape, and I'd like an explination."
0,74,10,TEAL'C,I said no such thing!
0,74,10,DANNY,All right. I'm obviously completely wrong about that.
0,74,10,TEAL'C,Yes. Don't talk to me again.
0,74,10,DANNY,"Yeah, right."
0,74,10,KEGAN,I told you to leave him alone!
0,74,10,DANNY,"He was there, Kegan. You heard him. Why would he deny that?!"
0,74,10,KEGAN,The nightsickness affects your mind.
0,74,10,DANNY,"That doesn't explain the dreams I've had. Something is wrong here, Kegan. Somethings not ri . . ."
0,74,10,KEGAN,"Carlin -- It's bad enough he named you as part of his delusion. Now, if people hear you talking like this , there gonna think you're night sick."
0,74,10,DANNY,People?
0,74,10,KEGAN,Not that I would ever -- Carlin -
0,74,10,DANNY,"No, no, no! Of course not. It's just a dream. (She puts her hand on his shoulder, then thru his hair, and back to his shoulder - lucky girl!"
0,74,11,CALDER,Why didn't the memory stamp work on Teal'C?
0,74,11,BRENNA,I'm sure it was the creature his species has within him. We've stamped him again. This time it seems to be holding.
0,74,11,CALDER,What about the other?
0,74,11,BRENNA,"They're all proven to be excellent workers. In fact, Therra has some ideas for improving the plant."
0,74,11,CALDER,Therra?
0,74,11,BRENNA,"The personality we've stamped Major Carter with. We've been having problems with pressure, she suggested an automated release valve. If we didn't have to regulate the pressure manually, we'd free up workers for other tasks."
0,74,11,CALDER,Maybe one day she could increase productivity to the point where we don't even need workers.
0,74,11,BRENNA,What would be so wrong with that?
0,74,11,CALDER,
0,74,11,BRENNA,We could tell them.
0,74,11,CALDER,"That they've been lied to all their lives? And how would the people of the city react? When there was lest to go around, and they had to make room for --- workers? Right now, in our city, Brenna, we have no crime. No unemployment"
0,74,11,BRENNA,But---
0,74,11,CALDER,They're happy--- where they are. That's what the stamp assures. Do only what is necessary to guarantee uninterrupted power.
0,74,11,BRENNA,"Yes, Administrator ---"
0,74,12,SAM,Have you had a chance to look over my plans yet? I'd like to get started ---
0,74,12,BRENNA,We can't do the improvements.
0,74,12,SAM,"But, you said ---"
0,74,12,BRENNA,"No, they would require the generators to be offline too long. If they begin to freeze we might not be able to get them started again."
0,74,12,SAM,I agree there's some risk ---
0,74,12,BRENNA,Too much risk.
0,74,12,SAM,"Well, OK! What about my other ideas?"
0,74,12,BRENNA,I'm sorry. This plant is all that stands between us and the ice. Uninterrupted production is more important than efficientcy. You may return to work.
0,74,12,SAM,"Brenna, I know you were excited about this, what happened?"
0,74,12,BRENNA,"Well, I've thought it over."
0,74,12,SAM,At least let me come up with a safer way ---
0,74,12,BRENNA,Therra --- please leave.
0,74,12,SAM,It's my honor to serve. It's not like I'm making this up off the top of my head! I've got a detailed plan including the safeguards.
0,74,12,JACK,I'm sure she knows that.
0,74,12,SAM,I could make a difference here! She won't even let me.
0,74,12,JACK,"Just go back to her in a couple days, offer something small. Maybe you gotta work into the big stuff."
0,74,12,SAM,How do you stay so calm?
0,74,12,JACK,"I think in another life, I handled dangerous explosives. I don't know."
0,74,12,SAM,What do you mean in another life?
0,74,12,JACK,"I don't mean anything by it. Just an expression, isn't it?"
0,74,13,GH,Major?
0,74,13,GH,I understand. You and your team have been out there a long time.
0,74,13,MAJOR,"No, Sir. When I says there's no sign , I mean literally, not a trace!"
0,74,13,GH,"What are you saying, Major?"
0,74,13,MAJOR,"I can't imagine what scientific reason Major Carter or Doctor Jackson would have to want to check out those ice fields. Even if they wanted to go up there, there's no way in Hell Colonel O'Neill would have let them."
0,74,13,GH,According to Administrator Calder --- Colonel O'Neill believed the risk was acceptable.
0,74,13,MAJOR,"I can't speak for that, Sir, I'm not a diplomat."
0,74,13,GH,Off the record ---
0,74,13,MAJOR,"They're not out there, Sir. No way!"
0,74,13,GH,Administrator Calder says they are.
0,74,13,MAJOR,Then I'd say he's a damn lier!
0,74,15,DANNY,"Kegan, I need to ask you something. How did I get here?"
0,74,15,KEGAN,What do you mean how'd you get here? You were transferred from the mines.
0,74,15,DANNY,"No, before that."
0,74,15,KEGAN,Before?
0,74,15,DANNY,Yes.
0,74,15,KEGAN,You don't remember?
0,74,15,DANNY,"I keep --- thinking about it, and all I come up with is a handful of memories."
0,74,15,KEGAN,"What is this about, anyway?"
0,74,15,DANNY,I'm just wondering if Jona and Therra were ever my friends.
0,74,15,KEGAN,
0,74,15,DANNY,Maybe I don't recognize them because it was years ago ---
0,74,15,KEGAN,They are just trying to get close to Brenna so that they could get special treatment. Especially Therra.
0,74,15,DANNY,"Look, all I'm saying ---"
0,74,15,KEGAN,All I'm saying --- is that if you're friends with those two --- you're not mine.
0,74,17,MAN,Pressure's too high! Pipes are hot!
0,74,17,SECOND MAN,We're too late! This whole section's gonna blow! Help me get him out of here!
0,74,18,SAM,What's going on?
0,74,18,MAN,Pressure overload.
0,74,18,SAM,We've gotta fix it!
0,74,18,MAN,It's too late. We have to evacuate.
0,74,19,DANNY,What's happening?
0,74,19,SAM,"If that boiler blows, it'll take this whole section with it. Now, I can shut it off from here, but somebody's gotta get back there and open the primary release valve."
0,74,19,KAGEN,Carlin!
0,74,19,DANNY,Get these people out of here!
0,74,19,KAGEN,Get out of here! CLOSE THIS SECTION!!!!!!!!!!
0,74,20,DANNY,Here! They release the pressure.
0,74,20,JACK,Hey!
0,74,20,TEAL'C,I must return to my duties.
0,74,20,BRENNA,"I want you to rest! Stay here until I say you're well enough to work. As for you 3, we all owe you a debt of gratitude. You risked your lives to save the plant."
0,74,20,DANNY&SAM,It is my honor to serve.
0,74,20,JACK,Right.
0,74,20,BRENNA,"If it hadn't been for your quick action, many lives would have been lost."
0,74,20,SAM,Next time will be different.
0,74,20,BRENNA,"Hopefully, there won't be a next time."
0,74,20,SAM,If you had listened to me in the first place ---
0,74,20,BRENNA,Therra! You're dismissed.
0,74,21,JACK,"Next time, don't hold back. You know, just - speak your mind."
0,74,21,SAM,She knows I'm right!
0,74,21,DANNY,There's something else going on.
0,74,21,SAM,Tor.
0,74,21,DANNY,He said we were part of something called SG-1.
0,74,21,JACK,"Yeah, what is that?"
0,74,21,SAM,A team?
0,74,21,JACK,What kind of a name is that for a team?
0,74,21,DANNY,I don't know. Look I just think I'm supposed to be doing something more important.
0,74,21,SAM,We're helping our people survive an ice age.
0,74,22,DANNY,"I don't know. Look, I just have this feeling that all of us are part of some bigger, grander thing."
0,74,22,JACK,"Well, I certainly understand what you're talking about."
0,74,22,DANNY,You do?
0,74,22,JACK,No.
0,74,22,DANNY,"Look, I don't know how to explain this, but I had this --- dream. You were in it."
0,74,22,JACK,Me?
0,74,22,DANNY,There was this big --- glowing --- puddle.
0,74,22,JACK,
0,74,22,SAM,"Wait a second , Jona. I had the same dream."
0,74,22,JACK,"Would you two stop talking like that, for cryin' out loud? It's an expression, right?"
0,74,22,DANNY,"Look, we can't talk right now, let's meet after lights out."
0,74,23,DANNY,So ---
0,74,23,SAM,So?
0,74,23,DANNY,Did you have the same dream?
0,74,23,JACK,About you?
0,74,23,SAM,
0,74,23,JACK,No. My dreams are about --- other things.
0,74,23,DANNY,Tor said we had to escape. He also said we had to remember. Remember what?
0,74,23,JACK,"Well, I remember when I was a foreman, anyone caught doing what we're doing right now, had their rations cut in half for a month."
0,74,23,SAM,We'll have to risk it.
0,74,23,DANNY,What if our memories have been somehow altered?
0,74,23,SAM,"Well, if that's true, then we can't be sure of anything."
0,74,23,JACK,My memory's fine.
0,74,23,DANNY,Really?
0,74,23,JACK,Yeah.
0,74,23,DANNY,What did you do in the mines?
0,74,23,JACK,I mined.
0,74,23,DANNY,"No, What did you DO?"
0,74,23,JACK,I remember shoveling ore into a cart.
0,74,23,DANNY,And?
0,74,23,JACK,I did that a lot.
0,74,24,SAM,I remember a feeling of cold and darkness.
0,74,24,DANNY,And that's where the 2 of you met?
0,74,24,JACK,Yeah.
0,74,24,SAM,Really?
0,74,24,JACK,"Sure. So, what's this important thing we're supposed to be doing?"
0,74,24,DANNY,"I told you. I don't know. I keep trying to remember, but all I come up with are images of this place."
0,74,24,SAM,"But if you're right, then everything we remember about this place is a lie."
0,74,24,DANNY,"Yeah, like a façade. It only works if we don't dig too deep beneath the surface, if we don't question it. So, that's what we have to do. We have to question everything, every assumption."
0,74,24,SAM,"We have to keep this to ourselves. If the others heard us talking this way, they'd think we were night sick."
0,74,24,JACK,What if We ARE night sick!
0,74,24,SAM,"I don't think so, SIR."
0,74,24,DANNY,What?
0,74,24,SAM,What?
0,74,24,DANNY,You just called Jona 'Sir'.
0,74,24,SAM,"Well, it's an expression --- isn't it?"
0,74,25,JANET,"Sir --- I have those medical reports we were waiting for. Major Griff did suffer some minor frostbite, but the rest of his team is fine."
0,74,25,GH,"Thank you, Doctor."
0,74,25,JANET,Any word from the planet?
0,74,25,GH,I spoke to Administrator Calder about that . He regretfully informed me that his search of the city turned up nothing.
0,74,25,JANET,"So, that's it?"
0,74,25,GH,"Short of going to war, all we can do is break off diplomatic relation. I'm not authorized to do that just yet."
0,74,25,JANET,I take it they have something we want?
0,74,25,GH,They're quite advanced in mettallergical and chemical technologies.
0,74,25,JANET,"We must have something they want, or they wouldn't've proposed trade."
0,74,25,GH,Stargate technology. Gate addresses.
0,74,25,JANET,"Oh, I understand that. They're surrounded by ice."
0,74,25,GH,"Far as I'm concerned, they need us a hell of a lot more than we need them. Apparently Adm. Calder doesn't seem to think so. I think he likes things just the way they are."
0,74,25,JANET,"Doesn't leave you with many options, does it, Sir?"
0,74,25,GH,"No, it doesn't. Which is why I've asked Major Griff to draw up covert search and rescue plans."
0,74,25,JANET,"Well, if you're looking for volunteers"
0,74,25,GH,"Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep that in mind."
0,74,26,JACK,Anymore dreams?
0,74,26,DANNY,"I saw that pool of light again, except this time we were all there. Including"
0,74,26,JACK,I dreamed about mining --- naked.
0,74,26,DANNY,Therra?
0,74,26,SAM,"Um --- a lot of numbers and letters keep popping into my mind. SG-1, DHD,"
0,74,26,DANNY,Sounds like gibberish to me.
0,74,26,SAM,"Well, it must mean something."
0,74,26,JACK,Excuse me?
0,74,26,SAM,Jona?
0,74,26,JACK,That means something.
0,74,26,SAM,What is it?
0,74,26,JACK,I don't know yet. Very impressive.
0,74,27,KEGAN,I see you've made some new friends.
0,74,27,DANNY,Yeah.
0,74,27,KEGAN,Carlin ---
0,74,27,DANNY,"I'm sorry, Kegan."
0,74,28,MAN,"I don't understand, his condition's getting worse. Let me check his wound."
0,74,28,BRENNA,Under no circumstance are you to remove those bandages. Just make sure he continues to eat and drink.
0,74,29,JACK,"I remember something. There's a man. He's bald and wears a short-sleeved shirt, and somehow he's very important to me. I think his name is Homer."
0,74,29,SAM,Doesn't ring a bell.
0,74,29,JACK,You?
0,74,29,SAM,Just a lot of vague images.
0,74,30,SAM,"You know, there are things about this place that I like."
0,74,30,JACK,Really?
0,74,31,JACK,Would it mean anything if I told you I remember something else?
0,74,31,SAM,What?
0,74,31,JACK,Feelings.
0,74,31,SAM,Feelings?
0,74,31,JACK,I remember feeling --- feelings.
0,74,31,SAM,For me?
0,74,31,JACK,"No, for TOR. I don't remember much, but I DO remember that."
0,74,31,SAM,So---
0,74,31,JACK,So--- I'm just saying.
0,74,31,SAM,"Well, then I feel better."
0,74,32,BRENNA,"For some reason, TOR seems to be having an adverse reaction to the memory stamp. I-I think he may be dying."
0,74,32,CALDER,Workers die. What about his friends?
0,74,32,BRENNA,"I've received a report. They are gathering together in secret. Administrator, I think they are starting to remember. Their brain chemistry is slightly different than ours --- that could be the reason. But we can restamp them."
0,74,32,CALDER,"No. No, I think it's time they found out what it's like out side."
0,74,32,BRENNA,All they really did was disapprove of our treatment of the workers.
0,74,32,CALDER,"No, NO! No, they did much more than disapprove. They passed judgment on us, Brenna. I'm simply doing the same."
0,74,32,BRENNA,"Yes, Sir."
0,74,32,CALDER,"Brenna, if for some reson, you can comply with my orders -"
0,74,32,BRENNA,"It's my honor to serve, Administrator."
0,74,35,CALDER,I don't understand.
0,74,35,JACK,"While we were on the grand tour, Carter spotted some ventilation shafts coming out of apparently no where. We checked it out."
0,74,35,CALDER,You were supposed to stay with your escort.
0,74,35,JACK,Yeah. I see how you wouldn't want out siders to know about your little slave labor forse underground.
0,74,35,CALDER,They are merely workers.
0,74,35,JACK,And what made them so worthy of that?
0,74,35,CALDER,Colonel ---
0,74,35,JACK,Administrator --- I will NOT recommend trade with a culture that enslaves it's own people. I don't care what technology you have to offer.
0,74,35,CALDER,This system of government has allowed our culture to survive an ice age.
0,74,35,JACK,Tell me --- what's the secret? Starvation? Fortune? What?
0,74,35,CALDER,Our methods are quite --- civilized.
0,74,35,JACK,Really?!
0,74,35,CALDER,"Yes. In fact, I'll show you."
0,74,36,JACK,"Thera, I think I know what's going on."
0,74,36,MAN,"Jona, Thera. Report to Brenna's quarters."
0,74,36,ONE OF THE MOVERS,We've got orders to take him to Brenna's room.
0,74,36,BRENNA,Put him down over there. You're dismissed.
0,74,36,SAM,What's the matter with him?
0,74,36,BRENNA,He's dying.
0,74,36,DANNY,Kel'No'Reem!
0,74,36,JACK,What?
0,74,36,DANNY,"I'm not sure what it means, but I think"
0,74,36,JACK,"It's a kind of meditation. He has to do it every day, or he gets sick. Right?"
0,74,36,SAM,"So-So, why doesn't he do it?"
0,74,36,JACK,Because he can't remember.
0,74,36,BRENNA,"Colonel O'Neill is correct. As you've begun to suspect, all of you have had your memories altered. You are Major Samantha Carter, Doctor Daniel Jackson, and your friend here is named Teal'C."
0,74,36,JACK,Where does Homer fit in?
0,74,36,BRENNA,"You were all they sent down. At first, I thought it was necessary to protect the city. Now things have gone too far. You don't belong here. You need to return to your own world. Your memories will come back more quickly once you are home."
0,74,36,JACK,Home?
0,74,36,BRENNA,"Yes, through there."
0,74,37,BRENNA,Adm. Culder!
0,74,37,CALDER,"Brenna, I must say I'm disappointed. But not surprised. See, I've been watching you grow weaker for some time now."
0,74,37,BRENNA,I've been coming to my sences.
0,74,37,CALDER,"Either way, you're no longer of any use to me. As for the rest of you, It's time you found out what the surface of this planet is really like."
0,74,39,JACK,Teal'C? You all right?
0,74,39,TEAL'C,I am.
0,74,39,DANNY,What happened?
0,74,39,TEAL'C,"When I removed my bandages, and realized I was unlike the rest of you, I began to remember. I placed myself in a deep state of Kel'No'Reem for the night, and my symbiote restored me back to health."
0,74,39,SAM,Brenna should be all right if we can get her to the uh ---
0,74,39,JACK,Infirmary.
0,74,39,SAM,Right.
0,74,39,CALDER,You'll never make it back to the stargate.
0,74,39,JACK,You know something? We've got you as a hostage. I don't see a problem.
0,74,39,DANNY,Jona ---
0,74,39,JACK,Jack!
0,74,39,DANNY,Right! We can't. We have to tell these people what's happening.
0,74,39,JACK,"Yep, you're right."
0,74,40,JACK,"Everybody! Can I have your attention please? I'd like to introduce you to someone. This man has been keeping you locked up down here, while he and his friends live it up on the surface!"
0,74,40,KEGAN,What are you talking about?
0,74,40,CALDER,Don't listen to them! They shot Brenna! It's true!
0,74,40,JACK,Listen to me! There is a big Domed city up there full of people YOU serve! They've been hiding it from you your entire lives!
0,74,40,KEGAN,It's a lie!
0,74,40,DANNY,"He's telling the truth, Kegan!"
0,74,40,CALDER,You can't let them get away!
0,74,40,KEGAN,Who are you?
0,74,40,JACK,That's a good question!
0,74,40,CALDER,My name is Calder. I was a supervisor in the mines before my transfer.
0,74,40,JACK,"Yeah, whatever. YOU WANT PROOF?!?!?!?!?!"
0,74,40,JACK,No ice --- no snow!
0,74,40,CALDER,You've accomplished nothing! These people will never be accepted in the city.
0,74,40,JACK,I think you're right about that.
0,74,40,DANNY,That's why we're gonna offer them a better place.
0,74,40,JACK,There's this nice little tropical planet out there. Where the beaches go on --- forever. This I remember clearly. You and your people can do your own shoveling for a while.
0,74,40,CALDER,You're destroying a way of life.
0,74,40,JACK,That's a shame. Teal'C? Wanna show these people how to get out of here?
0,74,40,BRENNA,"Ah, it hurts!"
0,74,40,SAM,I know. Try not to move it were gonna take you home with us.
0,74,40,BRENNA,Thank you.
0,74,40,SAM,So --- Colonel ---
0,74,40,JACK,Major.
0,74,40,SAM,That bald man you were trying to remember?
0,74,40,JACK,General Hammond.
0,74,40,SAM,Right.
0,74,40,JACK,"He's from Texas, you know. It's all coming back."
0,74,40,SAM,"Yes, Sir."
0,74,40,JACK,Sir ---
0,74,41,JACK,Let's go home.
0,74,41,SAM,"Yes, Sir."
