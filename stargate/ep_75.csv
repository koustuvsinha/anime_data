0,75,0,"""POINT OF NO RETURN""",By Paul Mullie & Joseph Mallozzi We begin with a shot from below of Sam pouring water in a glass.
0,75,0,SAM,Does anyone know what this meeting's all about?
0,75,0,DANNY,"No, but I hope it's important. I was working on translating the"
0,75,1,SAM,I still have to finish recalabrating MALP 3-K sensors for long-term
0,75,2,TEAL'C,I was unable to complete my Kel'No'Reem.
0,75,2,JACK,I was just about to do something important.
0,75,2,GH,"All right, people. As you were. We have ourselves a"
0,75,4,MAN,Hello. This is a message for Colonel Jack O'Neill and
0,75,9,GH,He goes on like that for a while.
0,75,9,MAN,"---and the C.I.A.-sanctioned Microwave harassment,"
0,75,10,GH,Quite a while.
0,75,10,MAN,--- And the Lizard people. (A smile slowly creeps
0,75,18,JACK,Interesting.
0,75,18,TEAL'C,It would appear base security has been breached.
0,75,18,GH,I want to know who this man is. I want to know how he got his
0,75,25,MAN,Colonel O'Neill?
0,75,25,JACK,Yeah?
0,75,25,MAN,Sorry I'm late. I think I was followed.
0,75,25,JACK,Ya sure?
0,75,25,MAN,Yeah. But don't worry. I managed to loose 'em.
0,75,25,JACK,Very professional. What's your name?
0,75,25,MARTIN,You can call me Martin.
0,75,25,JACK,
0,75,26,MARTY,If you

0,75,30,JACK,Okay ---
0,75,30,MARTY,"You're clean. You understand, a man in my position has to take"
0,75,31,JACK,Yeah. You never know who's listening.
0,75,34,MARTY,"Exactly! I don't know about you, but I always feel like I'm being"
0,75,35,JACK,"Come on, Martin. Let's get to it, what's going on here?"
0,75,35,MARTY,"You know as well as I do, Colonel."
0,75,35,JACK,I don't.
0,75,36,SAM,
0,75,37,DANNY,"You know, I've never been on a stakeout before. Shouldn't we have"
0,75,38,MARTY,A top secret government program involving instantaneous travel to
0,75,39,JACK,Sounds like a good idea for a TV show. If you're into that sort of
0,75,40,MARTY,"Colonel, let's not play games. If it isn't true, then why would you"
0,75,41,JACK,
0,75,42,MARTY,I Knew It!
0,75,42,JACK,But it has nothing to do with space travel.
0,75,42,MARTY,What does it have to do with?
0,75,42,JACK,Magnets.
0,75,42,MARTY,What the hell is that supposed to mean?!
0,75,42,JACK,"Nope, I've already said too much."
0,75,42,MARTY,"Colonel, you're not taking this seriously."
0,75,42,JACK,"No, I'm not."
0,75,42,MARTY,I need help.
0,75,42,JACK,Why? What seems ---
0,75,42,MARTY,I have to go thru the star gate!
0,75,42,JACK,"Marty, I don't ---"
0,75,42,MARTY,"No, I mean it. I've come to realize that I don't belong here. For the"
0,75,45,JACK,I thought the lunar landings were a hoax.
0,75,45,MARTY,"No, that was the story created by the government to direct attention"
0,75,51,JACK,"Check, please!"
0,75,53,SAM,We've got something. (Pointing to
0,75,57,DANNY,Do you have a current address?
0,75,57,SAM,"Yeah, I could get the prescription of his glasses if I wanted. (More"
0,75,58,MARTY,"So, you still don't believe me?! I'm an Alien!"
0,75,58,MARTY,"No --- what I believe, is that thousands of years ago, people were"
0,75,61,JACK,"Now, that's just crazy talk!"
0,75,61,MARTY,Want proof?! I can give you proof.
0,75,62,JACK,"Look, Marty, I'm a busy man. And you don't strike me as any great"
0,75,68,MARTY,"It's just over the next ridge. The ship's supposed to be buried, but"
0,75,69,JACK,Marty --- what makes
0,75,70,MARTY,"I can't explain it Colonel, I just have a gut feeling. We have"
0,75,71,JACK,"Well, that's very flattering, but I'm not an alien."
0,75,71,MARTY,
0,75,71,JACK,Right.
0,75,71,MARTY,Up here.
0,75,75,SAM,This is it.
0,75,75,DANNY,Nice place!
0,75,75,SAM,Hello?! (She proceeds to pick
0,75,77,DANNY,Something tells me we don't need to worry about this guy.
0,75,77,SAM,Except for the fact he happens to be very close to the truth. (She
0,75,81,TEAL'C,(Dead seriously!
0,75,84,DANNY,"Oh, Hello! Sam, you're gonna wanna --- take a look @ this! (Sam walks"
0,75,85,SAM,"Whoh, that's quite a collection! Tranqualizers, antidepressants,"
0,75,87,DANNY,"Yeah, why doesn't that surprise me?"
0,75,87,JACK,"Marty, we've been walking around for"
0,75,88,MARTY,I don't understand it! The clearing where I landed should be around
0,75,89,JACK,How do ya loose a spaceship?
0,75,89,MARTY,"Well, my memory isn't so good. Sometimes, I get a little confused. I"
0,75,90,JACK,"Yeah, well, there ya go. Hey, listen,(Grabs Marty's arm to stop his"
0,75,91,MARTY,
0,75,92,JACK,"Marty, listen to me! There IS no spaceship! You're NOT an alien!"
0,75,92,MARTY,You don't understand!
0,75,92,JACK,I get that a lot. Come on. I'll drive you back
0,75,94,SAM,Find anything?
0,75,94,DANNY,"Oh, yeah. It's a diary. Um --- April 12"
0,75,100,MAN,What have we got?
0,75,100,MAN #2,Activity in the house.
0,75,100,MAN,Looks like Martin's got visitors.
0,75,100,MAN # 2,That's not all. See the big guy? Watch what happens when I get a
0,75,102,GH,Come in.
0,75,102,JANET,"Sir, I have the results of the tests done on the medication that"
0,75,103,GH,That was fast.
0,75,103,JANET,Preliminary analysis was done in a Montana lab. They faxed it over.
0,75,104,GH,Meaning?
0,75,104,JANET,Several unidentifiable chemicals were present. I believe that the
0,75,105,GH,For what purpose?
0,75,105,JANET,"I can't say. I mean for all we know, the medications may be the cause"
0,75,106,GH,I'll mention that to Colonel O'Neill.
0,75,106,JANET,The name of the psychiatrist who prescribed the drugs was on the
0,75,107,PSYCHIATRIST,"I must say, your phone call piqued my curiosity. I don't often"
0,75,108,SAM,"Well, this concerns a particular patient of your , Martin Lloyd."
0,75,108,PSYCHIATRIST,"Oh, I see. Of course, you understand that doctor/patient"
0,75,109,SAM,"This is a matter of National Security, Doctor Tanner. The privilidge"
0,75,110,DR. TANNER,National security involving MARTIN! I find that hard
0,75,111,DANNY,Why do you say that?
0,75,111,DR. TANNER,"Let's put it this way, people like Martin sometimes compensate"
0,75,122,MARTY,"Colonel O'Neill! Colonel O'Neill, are you"
0,75,123,JACK,Martin?
0,75,123,MARTY,Please! I have to see you!
0,75,124,MARTY,"Oh, good. You're here. You have no I dea how --- (He stops when he"
0,75,125,JACK,"Um --- my friend --- Murrey. (Teal'C , still laying on the vibrating"
0,75,126,MARTY,You trust him?
0,75,126,JACK,"Oh, yeah!"
0,75,126,MARTY,I guess it's OK.
0,75,126,JACK,"Good, glad you're confortable."
0,75,126,MARTY,Don't ya wanna know how I
0,75,127,JACK,Uh --- OK!
0,75,127,MARTY,"In your car, I notice a map of"
0,75,128,JACK,There's 2.
0,75,128,MARTY,I'm surprised a man in your position wouldn't take more precautions
0,75,129,JACK,I'm not undercover.
0,75,129,MARTY,You think I'm making this all up. Look at this. (He
0,75,131,JACK,Yes --- It all
0,75,132,MARTY,"I propped it up against the inside of my door. When I got home, it"
0,75,133,JACK,"If you prop it up against the inside of your door, how do you get out?"
0,75,133,MARTY,"Thru the window! You think I'm so stupid, I go out my own front"
0,75,136,JACK,"So, you leave the window unlocked?"
0,75,136,MARTY,"That's right. I put a hair on the inside of the window sill, and when"
0,75,137,JACK,Marty!
0,75,137,MARTY,"The point is, someone was there. They're after me. Help me, please!"
0,75,138,JACK,What do you want?
0,75,138,MARTY,I wanna go home. You have to take me thru the stargate.
0,75,139,DANNY,"Dr. Tanner, it may be true that Martin is delusional, but there are"
0,75,140,DR. TANNER,Such as?
0,75,140,DANNY,He seems to be taking a lot of medication.
0,75,140,DOCTOR,Only what is necessary.
0,75,141,DOCTOR,"Major, please! I don't have time to discuss pharmacology. This"
0,75,142,SAM,"Doctor Tanner, we obtained samples of Martin's medication, apparently,"
0,75,143,DOCTOR,That's obserd! There must be some kind of mistake!
0,75,143,SAM,The tests were very thourough.
0,75,143,DOCTOR,"I don't know anything about this. I mean, I just write the"
0,75,144,SAM,We're not accusing you of anything! We're just looking for answers.
0,75,144,DOCTOR,You realize that this investigation is only gonna fuel Martin's
0,75,145,SAM,We have no choice! Now we're gonna get to the bottom of this with or
0,75,146,DOCTOR,I --- don't know what else I could tell you.
0,75,146,DANNY,"Does he have any friends, or relatives, anyone else?"
0,75,147,DOCTOR,This is his work address.
0,75,148,MARTIN,"I knew it would come to this! They'll do tests on me, they'll"
0,75,149,JACK,Marty!
0,75,149,MARTY,I'm never gonna get home! I wanna ---
0,75,149,JACK,
0,75,151,MARTY,
0,75,155,JACK,Yeah. (Marty
0,75,156,MARTY,But ---
0,75,156,JACK,Just for a while. Trust me.
0,75,156,MARTY,What about the symbols?
0,75,156,JACK,What symbols?
0,75,156,MARTY,"It's one of the things I see in the flashes, there's 7 of em. I wrote"
0,75,159,SAM,Hello?!
0,75,159,DANNY,This is the place?
0,75,159,SAM,Yeah. This is the address he gave us.
0,75,159,DANNY,"But --- it doesn't look like anyone's place of work, there's --- no"
0,75,160,SAM,Except for the guys with guns!
0,75,160,MARTY,This is totally unfair! Just cause I'm from
0,75,162,JACK,Carter's not answering her phone.
0,75,162,TEAL'C,Should they not have contacted us by now?
0,75,162,JACK,Yep.
0,75,162,MARTY,"You know, guys, it would be a really good idea if I took some of my"
0,75,163,JACK,I don't think so.
0,75,163,MARTY,"The thing is, ifI go too long without it, I tend to get a little"
0,75,165,JACK,"Marty, sit down. Let's talk about these symbols."
0,75,165,MARTY,"They mean something, don't they?"
0,75,165,JACK,"Right now, I need you to think very carefully. Where did you see them?"
0,75,165,MARTY,"I told you, I have these visions. I don't know where they come from."
0,75,166,JACK,Implant?!
0,75,166,MARTY,They put an implant in my head. I always thought they were sending me
0,75,167,TEAL'C,To whom are you referring?
0,75,167,MARTY,"You know --- them. The secret government. The New World Order, black"
0,75,169,JACK,Marty! For GOD's Sake!
0,75,169,MARTY,"You don't believe me. My neurolgist didn't believe me either,the"
0,75,170,JACK,This is going no where! I'm gonna go look
0,75,171,MARTY,Hey! Where ya goin'? Murrey --- (Teal'C
0,75,174,MAN,
0,75,174,SAM,Who are you?
0,75,174,MAN,"We're the guys with the guns, which means you answer OUR questions! So,"
0,75,175,DANNY,I'm Doctor Daniel Jackson. This is Major Samantha Carter.
0,75,175,SAM,We're with the Air forse.
0,75,175,MAN,"Well,"
0,75,176,SAM,Classified.
0,75,176,MAN,What do you know about Martin Lloyd?
0,75,176,SAM,Never heard of him.
0,75,176,MAN,"Yesterday, you were conducting an illegal search in his house."
0,75,176,DANNY,(Joining in on the fun of acting dumb
0,75,177,SAM,"So, who are you guys, really? CIA? NID?"
0,75,177,MAN,What do you know about Martin Lloyd?
0,75,180,MARTY,"Can I come out yet?,"
0,75,180,JACK,"Psychiatrist's office was completely empty, like no one"
0,75,181,TEAL'C,"So, what now, O'Neill?"
0,75,181,JACK,I got some people on it. Where's Marty?
0,75,181,TEAL'C,He became insistant in his demands for medication.
0,75,181,MARTY,"Uh --- Murrey? Listen, uh --- I'm REALLY Sorry I"
0,75,184,JACK,I don't get it. How does a nut case like that get a set of gate
0,75,187,TEAL'C,"In hindsight, we should have given him his"
0,75,188,MARTY,Colonel! I remember where my ship is.
0,75,188,MAN,"We know you were in Martin's house, because we got you on video. (Puts"
0,75,189,DANNY,He's an associate.
0,75,189,MAN,"Yeah, we know that! We also know that he's not from around here."
0,75,189,DANNY,Not from Montana?
0,75,189,MARTOUF LOOKING MAN,I think you know what I mean.
0,75,189,MARTY,We should have turned left @ the bottom of the ravine instead of
0,75,190,TEAL'C,Do you now believe Martin is correct about his spaceship?
0,75,190,JACK,No --- but he's the closes thing we've got to a lead on Carter
0,75,191,MARTY,"This is it! I told you! (Running, while looking back at Jack and"
0,75,196,SOLDIER,The material the object is made from is definatelly not
0,75,200,MARTY,That's not right. It's too small! That can't be my ship.
0,75,200,JACK,There's another ship out there?
0,75,200,TEAL'C,Could it be an excape pod?
0,75,200,MARTY,That's it! There must be some kind of malfunction! We abandoned the
0,75,201,JACK,We? There's MORE of you? How many more?
0,75,201,MARTY,I'm not sure.
0,75,201,SOLDIER,"There can't be too many, Sir. Maybe 4 or 5 @ the most."
0,75,201,MARTY,"All this time, I thought the government was watching me. What if it"
0,75,202,TEAL'C,What would these others want?
0,75,202,MARTY,I don't know. Maybe they're afraid. They don't wanna be exposed.
0,75,202,TEAL'C,"If that is the case, then these others may indeed be responsible for"
0,75,204,DANNY,I wouldn't say ordinary.
0,75,204,SAM,He's very good at what he does.
0,75,204,MLM,What's his area of expertise?
0,75,204,SAM,Speechwriter.
0,75,204,MLM,
0,75,205,DANNY,"Oh, that's very good! Did you draw that"
0,75,206,SAM,What IS it?!
0,75,206,DANNY,"That --- That's a DUCK, isn't it?!"
0,75,207,DANNY,We'll just wait here.
0,75,207,MARTY,"Our home world was under attack. We were sent here to find allies,"
0,75,208,JACK,"Well, we have our moments."
0,75,208,MARTY,The enemy was too powerful. They wanted to make us slaves. They
0,75,209,TEAL'C,The Goa'Uld.
0,75,209,MARTY,"Yes, that's it!"
0,75,209,JACK,Show him.
0,75,209,TEAL'C,"The enemy of which you speak enslaved my people, murdered my father,"
0,75,211,MURREY!!!!!,
0,75,211,SOLDIER,"Colonel, We've completed the"
0,75,212,JACK,All right. Let's do it!
0,75,212,MARTY,"Wait, wait! You can't! The pod has remote sensors. If you penetrated"
0,75,213,TEAL'C,Perhaps this can be used to our advantage O'Neill.
0,75,213,SAM,"I don't get this. These guys know what a symbiote is, but if they were"
0,75,214,DANNY,I don't know. That's why I hate working for the government. Every
0,75,215,MAN,"Very true , Doctor Jackson."
0,75,215,DANNY,
0,75,215,DR. TANNER(DT),I understand your reluctance to cooperate. In situations
0,75,219,DANNY,"You're not a real doctor, are you?"
0,75,220,MLM,Looks like the experiment's been discovered. What do we do?
0,75,220,DT,Get the van!
0,75,220,DANNY,(Looking exceptionally handsome with a BLUE shirt on! You know what
0,75,221,DT,Not exactly!
0,75,221,MARTY,This is NOT a good idea --- did I mention this is not a good idea?! I
0,75,222,JACK,"Hang in there, Marty! And stop talking into your lapel."
0,75,222,MARTY,"Oh, it's EASY for you guys, all nice and cozy back in your van eating"
0,75,225,DT,"I must say, Martin, this is very disappointing. You stopped taking your"
0,75,226,MARTY,"I'm not crazy, and you're not a psychiatrist. You see this? (Pointing"
0,75,227,DT,Martin. You've really made a mess of things this time. (He presses a
0,75,228,MARTY,Nice van! What do you call that color? KIND OF A
0,75,228,MAN,Just get in!
0,75,228,JACK,"All right, they're moving."
0,75,228,MARTY,"So, you're gonna drug me again?"
0,75,228,DT,"Well, obviously, that didn't work. I'm"
0,75,229,MARTY,"You're not gonna kill me? You know how many people know about this,"
0,75,231,DT,We're gonna do what we have to do.
0,75,231,MARTY,This isn't right. I know you. I know all of you. We were on this ship
0,75,233,DT,Martin---
0,75,233,MARTY,It's not too late. Our people are at war. They need us.
0,75,233,DT,"Martin, I hate to see you like this. You're my best agent."
0,75,233,MARTY,I was never any kind of agent! You're just saying that because you
0,75,234,DT,"Well, aren't you?"
0,75,234,MARTY,
0,75,235,DT,"With all the secretcy, and all the lies, you can get confused."
0,75,235,MARTY,Who's confused! I know who I am! Why are you guys doing this? Why
0,75,236,JACK,They've stopped. Get to them!
0,75,237,JACK,Seal off the area. No one in or out. (Jack and
0,75,239,SAM,Sir?
0,75,239,JACK,You all right? (Digs in
0,75,242,MARTY,"Oh, Murrey! Am I glad to see you! Oh"
0,75,242,JACK,Where are your friends?
0,75,242,MARTY,I'm not sure.
0,75,242,JACK,Sargent? Any sign of the targets?
0,75,242,SARGENT,"Negative , Sir!"
0,75,242,JACK,They just disappeared?
0,75,242,MARTY,"They're Aliens, right? I got evidence. Look."
0,75,242,JACK,What's that?
0,75,242,MARTY,A mobile computer device. I snuck it out of Tanner's bag. It has
0,75,243,JACK,What?
0,75,243,MARTY,"Guys, we'd better get out of here. This thing is counting down!!!!!"
0,75,243,JACK,
0,75,245,MARTY,That's weird! I'm sure this is a countdown for some sort of
0,75,248,MARTY,Exactly! This is just like I remembered!
0,75,248,SAM,Chevron 7 is locked!
0,75,248,DANNY,He was right! It's an active gate.
0,75,248,SAM,Sending the MALP thru.
0,75,248,MARTY,I remember EVERYTHING now! There WAS no malfunction!
0,75,248,JACK,What are you talking about?
0,75,248,MARTY,"When we abandoned the ship, we did it deliberately. We were loosing"
0,75,250,JACK,"So, they gave you the drugs?"
0,75,250,MARTY,They're not --- bad guys. They're just hiding.
0,75,250,SAM,Receiving MALP telemetry.
0,75,250,MARTY,"You're gonna hunt them down, aren't you?"
0,75,250,JACK,Not me.
0,75,250,MARTY,"But the military, the government?"
0,75,250,JACK,I don't think anyone's gonna find them.
0,75,250,DANNY,
0,75,250,MARTY,Really?
0,75,250,DANNY,"Yeah , it's safe --- but, uh --- you're not gonna like it."
0,75,251,MARTY,"They were right! If we'd gone back, we'd be dead now."
0,75,251,JACK,"I'm sorry, Martin."
0,75,251,MARTY,"So, now what?"
0,75,251,JACK,We go home.
