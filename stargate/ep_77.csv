0,77,0,"""THE CURSE""","By Paul Mullie & Joseph Mallozzi We begin with a room full of ancient artifacts. An older man pick up a statue, looks at it, and then writes something down."
0,77,0,MAN,Doctor Jordan?
0,77,0,DR JORDAN,Steven!
0,77,0,STEVEN,What are you doing here so late?
0,77,0,DR. JORDAN,"Actually, I was just about to go down to the lab. We finally have a chance to do a resonance scan on the osiris jar."
0,77,0,STEVEN,Great! Great!
0,77,0,DR. JORDAN,"Another couple of weeks, and we never would have known what was inside."
0,77,0,STEVEN,"Well, we could always break the seal, and take a look. Joking. Well, half joking."
0,77,0,DR. JORDAN,"The Egyptian government expects these items returned intact. If we were in their place, I'm sure that we ---"
0,77,0,STEVEN,"Sir, you watch. The scan will reveal that that unopened jar contains the mummified heart of a 3000 year old pharaoh, and we will have to just hand it over."
0,77,0,DR. JORDAN,I know. I know.
0,77,0,STEVEN,"It's the find of a life time , Professor."
0,77,0,DR,
0,77,0,STEVEN,"Yes, I just have a few things --- I'll see ya down there."
0,77,0,DR. JORDAN,"All right , then."
0,77,1,DANNY,Morning.
0,77,1,JACK,Hey.
0,77,1,DANNY,What's that?
0,77,1,JACK,It's --- Um --- Teal'C's into this stuff. I don't get it. A great week is in store for you --- You're gone on a trip ---
0,77,1,DANNY,Let me see that.
0,77,1,JACK,O-Kay!
0,77,1,DANNY,"Oh, my God!"
0,77,1,JACK,What?
0,77,1,DANNY,He's dead!
0,77,1,JACK,Who?
0,77,1,DANNY,My Archeology Professor.
0,77,3,STEVEN,"Doctor David Jordan was a teacher, a celebrated author, a much revered expert in the field of Archaeology, and yet, to the end, he remained first and foremost, a student, guided by the simple desire to discover, and understand. It's fitting, then, that a man, who dedicated his life --- Who dedicated his life to reviving the wonders and majesty of long-dead civilizations, should himself gain a measure of immortality thru that very accomplishment. I worked with Doctor Jordan for close to 15 years. He was like a father to me. Thru his many successes , and Some of his --- bitter disappointments. I'll remember him always as a dedicated Archaeologist, a kind, and generous man, and a true friend. The prodigal son returns!"
0,77,3,DANNY,Steven? Sarah.
0,77,3,SARAH,Daniel. It's good to see you.
0,77,3,DANNY,Yeah. Despite the circumstances.
0,77,3,SARAH,"I know. I can't believe he's gone. (Her hand lingers on his waist. Grab that butt, girlfriend. You know you want to. She grabs his hand."
0,77,3,DANNY,"So, what exactly happened? I mean --- uh --- the paper I read attributed his death to the curse of Osiris."
0,77,3,STEVEN,"According to the police, There was a slow gas leak in the lab, and something must have caused a spark, the whole place went up, he was killed instantly."
0,77,3,SARAH,"We would have called you, but , nobody knew where to find you."
0,77,3,DANNY,That's --- uh --- that's OK.
0,77,3,SARAH,"I'm glad you're here. So, how long has it been? 4 years?"
0,77,3,5.,
0,77,3,STEVEN,What have you been up to?
0,77,3,DANNY,Uh --- I've been busy.
0,77,3,SARAH,"Really? I've looked for signs of you out on the fringes. There's been no papers, no research projects. It's like you fell of the face of the earth."
0,77,3,DANNY,"Yeah, it is a little like that, isn't it?"
0,77,3,STEVEN,"As I recall, the last time I saw you, you were giving a lecture to an empty room."
0,77,3,DANNY,"Uh --- Well, it was full when I started."
0,77,3,STEVEN,"Well, maybe the world wasn't ready to hear that the pyramids were built by Aliens --- or was it men from Atlantis?"
0,77,3,SARAH,"Steven, please!"
0,77,3,DANNY,"Yes, Steven. Please."
0,77,3,STEVEN,"Why did you come? You manage to stay away all this time. If you're looking for closure, Daniel, I'd say you're a little late."
0,77,3,DANNY,"All ways a pleasure, Steven! So, are you doing anything, or ---"
0,77,3,SARAH,"No, I'm all yours. I'm sorry. He's not usually like this. Last couple of days have been really hard on him."
0,77,3,DANNY,"Steven? No, he's right. I should have come back sooner. I guess I was afraid I wouldn't be welcome."
0,77,3,SARAH,"Are you joking? Even after everything that happened, Dr. Jordan never thought any less of you. You were his best student."
0,77,3,DANNY,"Yes, that became the laughing stock of the Archeological community."
0,77,3,SARAH,He kept hoping that you'd find proof. Something to shut everyone up.
0,77,3,DANNY,"No, he thought I was nuts."
0,77,3,SARAH,"That's not true. Look, why do you think it's so hard for Steven to see you here? He's always been in your shadow. Even after you left."
0,77,3,DANNY,I hear his book's on the best seller's list.
0,77,3,SARAH,I know. He's --- getting a Porsche.
0,77,3,OWW!,
0,77,3,SARAH,"I know. Look, I have to admit. I thought you didn't come back because of me."
0,77,3,DANNY,"(Just noticed, he's wearing a yummy blue shirt with a tie."
0,77,3,SARAH,We could have ended it better than we did.
0,77,3,DANNY,"Maybe. The truth is, I got caught up in something --- incredible."
0,77,3,SARAH,"You found something, didn't you? Something that supports your theory? Tell me. Come on."
0,77,3,DANNY,I can't.
0,77,3,SARAH,
0,77,3,DANNY,
0,77,3,SARAH,"Now, that's the Daniel I remember. Come on, I want to show you something. (He grabs it, lucky girl!"
0,77,4,GH,As you were.
0,77,4,JACK,"So, General. Who's getting assigned to SG-1?"
0,77,4,GH,No one. I've decided to reschedule your next mission until Dr. Jackson returns. You're all long over due for some personal leave.
0,77,4,JACK,"Yes, Sir. But the LEAVING part has been a little problem."
0,77,4,GH,"Oh, I think you'll make it to the front door before we realize we can't do without you. Dismissed."
0,77,4,JACK,"Thank you, Sir. Carter! You finally ready to take me up on that fishing trip?"
0,77,4,SAM,"Uh --- actually, Sir, I have a few projects on the go."
0,77,4,JACK,"Come on. Are you really trying to tell me you'd rather be in a dark, dank, dismal underground, than sit on a dock with your feet perched up, sippin' a cold one, and --- casting for that ever elusive --- crappy?"
0,77,4,SAM,"Strange as it may sound , Sir, yes. (Looks at his body again!"
0,77,4,JACK,"To each his own! Her! I meant her --- I think. So, Teal'C! (Teal'C was looking away, probably because he knew Jack would ask him next!"
0,77,4,SARAH,I thought you'd like to see what we were working on before the accident.
0,77,4,DANNY,
0,77,4,SARAH,I only wish we had more time with them. The Egyptian government has made a formal request for their return. We've been desperately trying to learn as much as we can about them before the deadline.
0,77,4,DANNY,"""Woe to all who this, my final resting place."""
0,77,4,SARAH,"Careful, now. All these artifacts are cursed. Well, that's what they say."
0,77,4,DANNY,"Yeah, I --- read something like that."
0,77,4,SARAH,Every member of the original expedition in 1931 died within a year of the dig. Then the ship transporting these artifacts to American sank off the coast of New Jersey 6 months later.
0,77,4,DANNY,The Steward Expedition.
0,77,4,SARAH,Yes.
0,77,4,DANNY,Those deaths were attributed to mold spores that were released from the unsealed chamber.
0,77,4,SARAH,"Well, mold spores aren't exactly front page material."
0,77,4,DANNY,"No, I guess not. Uh --- if these things went down with the ship in 1931, how'd they end up here?"
0,77,4,SARAH,"Well, they found the wreck a couple of months ago. These artifacts were still in their packing crates. They brought it up, and shipped it to the museum. We just got them last week."
0,77,4,DANNY,I can stay for a couple more days if you need help cataloging these. What?
0,77,4,SARAH,Something's missing.
0,77,4,DANNY,Are you sure?
0,77,4,SARAH,"Positive. A gold Amulet. Daniel, I've got to find it."
0,77,4,JACK,"Just so we're clear on this, Sir. It's gonna be me, Teal'C, and the great outdoors . That means no cell phones, no FAX machines, not another living soul for miles. We'll be unavailable, inaccessible."
0,77,4,GH,Incommunicado.
0,77,4,JACK,"Minnesota, Sir."
0,77,4,GH,I stand corrected.
0,77,4,JACK,"If there's an emergency back at the base, you better plan ahead and tell me now. If Thor needs me, he's gonna haveta beam me up! If the Tok'Ra, forget it!"
0,77,5,CURATOR,"Excuse the state of things. Budget cuts. I'm straightening the mess out, but these things take time."
0,77,5,DANNY,"Oh, I understand."
0,77,5,CURATOR,What am I looking for?
0,77,5,DANNY,An artifact that went missing from the Steward Expedition.
0,77,5,CURADOR,The Isis Jar.
0,77,5,DANNY,"Uh --- No, actually, I'm --- uh --- referring to a --- a --- a gold amulet with a little ebony - uh --- uh --- uh, it's listed as idem 14C. ("
0,77,5,CURATOR,That was sent up to Dr. Jordan along with the rest of the artifacts.
0,77,5,DANNY,Ya sure?
0,77,5,CURATOR,I sent it myself. I can show you the paperwork.
0,77,5,DANNY,"No, Uh --- what's this ---uh ---uh ---Isis --- Jar you were talking about?"
0,77,5,CURATOR,I'll show you. The damn crate was mislabeled when it came in. I only found it a couple days ago.
0,77,5,DANNY,Uh --- this one?
0,77,5,CURATOR,"Oh, Yeah, yeah. Never seen those symbols before, have you?"
0,77,5,DANNY,"Uh, yes. I'm gonna need to do a translation."
0,77,5,CURATOR,"Well, if ya need me, I'll be in the back cataloging the Polynesian death masks."
0,77,6,SAM,Carter.
0,77,6,DANNY,"Sam, it's me."
0,77,6,SAM,"Hang on a sec. Thanks for your help, Sergeant."
0,77,6,SILER,"Yeah, no sweat, Major."
0,77,6,SAM,Where are you?
0,77,6,DANNY,I'm still in Chicago. I'm in the basement of a museum with what appears to be an Egyptian burial jar ---
0,77,6,O-KAY?,
0,77,6,DANNY,"That may not be out of the ordinary in a museum, granted, but there's something else beside the usual hieroglyphs. There's a 2nd set of markings. They're Goa'Uld symbols."
0,77,7,TEAL'C,"There appears to be no fish here, O'Neill."
0,77,7,JACK,
0,77,7,TEAL'C,"(Looking Oh, so HOT in a fishing hat"
0,77,8,JACK,You didn't!
0,77,8,TEAL'C,By request of General Hammond.
0,77,8,JACK,"Go away. WHAT?!?! Yes, Daniel. He's right here! Please hold."
0,77,8,TEAL'C,DanielJAckson. We have caught nothing. We are fishing.
0,77,8,DANNY,"Right. Um, listen, I need a little help with a translation. I've got a line her that reads Hako thra terak shree!"
0,77,8,TEAL'C,Banished to oblivion.
0,77,8,DANNY,"Right. OK, Uh --- thank you."
0,77,8,TEAL'C,"If you require assistance, I would be more than happy to return to the SGC!"
0,77,8,DANNY,"No, thanks. I think I can take it from here."
0,77,8,TEAL'C,Are you certain?
0,77,8,JACK,"Gimme that! Goodbye, Daniel!"
0,77,8,DANNY,"Uh --- no, wait wa ---"
0,77,10,DANNY,"During the ritual of mummification, the Ancient Egyptians would remove the vital organs of the deceased, and place them in jars, which would then be buried with the sarcophagus so that they could be accessed in the after life."
0,77,10,GH,Is that what we're looking at here?
0,77,10,DANNY,"That's what I thought at first, but looking at the reports on the original expedition, no sarcophagus was found. The Hieroglyphs identify the jar as belonging to Isis, who was the Egyptian Mother Goddess."
0,77,10,SAM,A Goa'Uld?
0,77,10,DANNY,"That's possible. See, Isis was a consort of Osiris, supposedly the first Pharaoh of Egypt. According to legend, he was placed in a magic box, and dumped into the Nile by his brother SETH."
0,77,10,GH,"Now, that name I recognize."
0,77,10,DANNY,"The Goa'Uld symbols indicate that Isis and Osiris suffered some sort of punishment, or --- banishment."
0,77,10,SAM,Where to?
0,77,10,DANNY,I have NO idea.
0,77,10,GH,"Major, I want the contents analyzed."
0,77,10,SAM,"Yes, Sir."
0,77,10,DANNY,"Uh, now I'd be careful if I were you. For all we know, it could be some sort of Goa'Uld bobby-trap left behind by Osiris as revenge. Also, it's --- it's cursed, so ---"
0,77,10,SAM,Thanks for the warning.
0,77,10,DANNY,"General, there's something else. The inventory of the steward expedition lists --- 2 jars."
0,77,10,GH,Can you find the other one?
0,77,10,DANNY,"Well, I can try. I was gonna head back to Chicago tonight."
0,77,11,DANNY,
0,77,11,STEVEN,Do you mind?!
0,77,11,DANNY,What are you doing here?
0,77,11,STEVEN,What are YOU doing here?
0,77,11,DANNY,I asked first.
0,77,11,STEVEN,
0,77,11,DANNY,Uh--- right! Um --- I had a few questions for the curator.
0,77,11,STEVEN,I don't think she's here. The lights were out when I came in. What did you wanna ask her about?
0,77,11,DANNY,I needed some information about items from the Steward Expedition. Some items were missing.
0,77,11,STEVEN,There's nothing missing.
0,77,11,DANNY,"Uh --- A canapic jar with some hieroglyphs, and some unusual markings."
0,77,11,STEVEN,The Osiris Jar.
0,77,11,DANNY,Yes.
0,77,11,STEVEN,Destroyed in the explosion.
0,77,11,DANNY,You SURE about that?
0,77,11,STEVEN,"Yes, positive."
0,77,11,DANNY,
0,77,11,STEVEN,"Daniel, if you're looking to get back together with Sarah, that's your business, I really couldn't care less, but I do have a problem with you coming here and involving your self in MY work!"
0,77,11,DANNY,"(Shining the light in Steven's eyes, AGAIN! I think he does that to piss Steven off"
0,77,11,STEVEN,No! MY work! Sarah and I were Dr. Jordan's assistants. YOU haven't been involved since you walked out on him.
0,77,11,DANNY,I didn't walk out on him. I was --- trying to protect him.
0,77,11,STEVEN,"You mean you distanced yourself to spare him the embarrassment of being associated with you. Daniel, you really should not have come back."
0,77,11,DANNY,"Look, I don't want to get into this with you right now, but you need my help."
0,77,11,STEVEN,"Why? Do you think there might Aliens involved. Oh, God!"
0,77,11,SAM,Preliminary analysis of the jar indicates the exterior is ordinary ceramic. It also appears as if the seal has been damaged.
0,77,11,GH,Any indication of what might be inside?
0,77,11,SAM,"Hopefully, a computer enhanced MRI will tell us something."
0,77,11,GH,Is that what I think it is?
0,77,11,SAM,"Yes, Sir! That's Goa'Uld Symbiote!"
0,77,11,DANNY,The police said the museum curator suffered a fatal blunt trauma to the skull.
0,77,11,SARAH,They don't think that you had anyth
0,77,11,DANNY,"No, they don't think that, but, of course, Steven didn't do anything to dissuade them from suspecting me, but fortunately, I know a few --- people. Anyway, uh --- they found some bricks at the bottom of the freight elevator shaft, and they think that --- it came from the wall above --- and --- she had a freak accident."
0,77,11,SARAH,"You know, the papers are saying the Curse of the Mummy strikes again."
0,77,11,DANNY,
0,77,11,SARAH,"Yeah, here."
0,77,11,DANNY,I can't make out the inscription around the collar.
0,77,11,SARAH,"We weren't able to identify the symbols, but Dr. Jordan copied them in his note book. Those markings are unlike anything we've ever seen before. They're not Egyptian."
0,77,11,DANNY,"No, they're not Egyptian."
0,77,11,SARAH,"So, what are they?"
0,77,11,DANNY,What are they? ---
0,77,11,SARAH,You know! How?
0,77,11,DANNY,"Let's just say I can't go into it right now, but this is really important. Did Dr. Jordan do any kind of preliminary tests on the Jar?"
0,77,11,SARAH,"Not that I know of, but he kept all his lab results on the computer."
0,77,12,JANET,It's dead. We can relax. Do we know how long it's been inside the jar?
0,77,12,SAM,"According to Daniel, several thousand years."
0,77,12,JANET,"Well, it's perfectly preserved. It could have died yesterday."
0,77,12,SARAH,Something's wrong.
0,77,12,DANNY,What?
0,77,12,SARAH,Dr. Jordan's files are gone. Everything's been wiped clean! Including his e-mail account.
0,77,12,DANNY,Do you keep backups?
0,77,12,SARAH,"Yeah, they're not here."
0,77,12,DANNY,What are you doing?
0,77,12,SARAH,"The system marks file spaces being deleted as ""Tombstone"". It scours the database looking for tombstone values, and marks them as being ready to be overridden. There's usually a window of about 30 days before that happens, so we MIGHT (Danny closes his eyes, sleepily"
0,77,12,DANNY,That's the carbon dating done on the item 14C.
0,77,12,SARAH,"Oh, My God! Daniel! It's over 10,000 years old! This means you were right all along!"
0,77,12,DANNY,Yeah --- I know.
0,77,12,SARAH,Egyptian civilization must be thousands of years older that we've ever assumed!
0,77,12,DANNY,Sarah --- you can't --- tell anyone about that.
0,77,12,SARAH,What are you talking about?! This is EXACTLY the evidence you've been looking for! This completely validates your theories!
0,77,12,DANNY,"Look, all we've got are the results of one carbon dating on a missing artifact."
0,77,12,SARAH,"So, we can contact the technician who preformed the analysis."
0,77,12,DANNY,What?
0,77,12,SARAH,Doctor Jordan wasn't the only one to get these results. Steven.
0,77,12,JANET,"By all right, the Goa'Uld symbiote should be a dried-up, desiccated husk, but instead, it's in perfect condition. Now, @ first, we thought it had been preserved, like a specimen in formaldehyde, but now, we are not so sure."
0,77,12,GH,What do you mean?
0,77,12,SAM,"Well, Sir. The outside of the jar is ceramic.The inside is a technologically advanced containment vessel. There's a tiny naquata power source that's designed to emit a low-level electrical charge."
0,77,12,GH,Why?
0,77,12,SAM,"Well, we can't be certain yet, Sir, but it looks like the jar is some sort of stasis chamber."
0,77,12,JANET,"From what we've been able to gather, Sir, We think that the symbiote was ALIVE when it was placed in the jar."
0,77,12,GH,"Why would it allow it's self to be removed from it's host, and places in stasis?"
0,77,12,SAM,"I don't believe it had a choice, Sir."
0,77,12,JANET,"You see, the liquid inside the jar seems to have sedative properties. If it's maintained at the proper temperatures, if it is provided with sufficient electrical charge, it could probably keep the symbiote alive indefinitely."
0,77,12,GH,"Then, why is it dead?"
0,77,12,SAM,"The seal was broken, presumably during transport."
0,77,12,GH,"Then, if what you're saying is true, and the second jar survived the trip unscased ---"
0,77,12,SAM,"Yes, Sir! There could be a Goa'Uld out there."
0,77,12,SARAH,Daniel? There you are! I've been looking all over for you!
0,77,12,DANNY,"Yeah, I'm just doing a little extra research."
0,77,12,SARAH,"I stopped by Steven's place, and he's gone. He's packed up everything and left."
0,77,12,DANNY,I know.
0,77,12,SARAH,"You think he stole the amulet, don't you?"
0,77,12,DANNY,Yes.
0,77,12,SARAH,To stop your theories from being proven correct?
0,77,12,DANNY,"It's possible. Anyway, I have to find him."
0,77,12,SARAH,"Well, I'll come with you."
0,77,12,DANNY,"No --- No, it's --- too dangerous."
0,77,12,SARAH,"We're talking about Steven, here."
0,77,12,DANNY,"Sarah, there have been 3 deaths already."
0,77,12,3 ?,
0,77,12,DANNY,They found the body of the technician that did the analysis of the carbon dating.
0,77,12,SARAH,"Daniel, I know Steven. He may be capable of a lot of things, but he's no murderer."
0,77,12,DANNY,"Well, you might not know him as well as you think you do --- at least --- not anymore."
0,77,12,SARAH,"What's that supposed to mean?! Oh, let me guess --- you can't explain, right?!"
0,77,12,DANNY,Sarah ---
0,77,12,SARAH,"Well, what do you expect, Daniel!? You show up after 5 years, but you can't say where you've been! You've got this mysterious ability to be able to read this ancient language nobody's ever seen before, but you can't explain how! Then, when we finally find the evidence to vindicate you to the entire archeological community --- you want to cover it up! What is going on?!"
0,77,12,DANNY,I know.
0,77,12,SARAH,"Then, why can't you trust me? What have you been doing for the past 5 years?"
0,77,12,DANNY,
0,77,12,SARAH,"I'm not asking you to tell the world --- I'm asking you to tell me. This is my life's work, too, Daniel. So, you're working for the government, what? DANIEL!"
0,77,12,DANNY,"(Turning to face her with his hands in his pocket --- nice clothes, BTW"
0,77,12,SARAH,"You're just going to disappear again, aren't you?"
0,77,12,DANNY,Yes.
0,77,12,SARAH,I think Steven was right. You never should have come back.
0,77,12,GH,(Danny has suddenly appeared @ base
0,77,12,DANNY,It makes since.
0,77,12,SAM,"So, how do we find him?"
0,77,12,DANNY,"Right now, this is our only lead. It's the gold amulet that was stolen from Dr. Jordan's office. Now, by Earth standards, it's a priceless relic, but the Goa'Uld isn't interested in it's monetary value, so---"
0,77,12,SAM,Then why take it?
0,77,12,DANNY,"That's a good question. It's a pretty standard representation of Osiris. He's carrying a crook and flail, the septers of kingship, and in the center is an aunk, which represents immortality."
0,77,12,GH,Could it be some sort of Goa'Uld device.
0,77,12,DANNY,It's possible.
0,77,12,SAM,That would explain why it was the only idem taken.
0,77,12,DANNY,"Well, I checked the other artifacts for any indication of Naquata, which is usually a sure sign of Goa'Uld technology, and I came up empty."
0,77,12,GH,"Assuming this Goa'Uld is Osiris, what does he want?"
0,77,12,DANNY,"He's been out of the loop a long time, He doesn't know what happened to SETH or RA. He could be looking for the Isis Jar."
0,77,12,SAM,Or --- a way off the planet.
0,77,12,GH,I've already put the base on alert.
0,77,12,JANET,"I managed to synthesize the liquid from the jar, so on it's own, it should act as a powerful sedative. One dart should be more than enough to knock out an adult Goa'Uld."
0,77,12,SAM,Do we REALLY want this thing alive?!
0,77,12,DANNY,"Well, even though it's been in stasis for that last several thousand years, it could still be a valueable source of information."
0,77,12,GH,I want you to hold that option in reserve. Your first priority is to stop the Goa'Uld with minimum risk to yourselves.
0,77,12,JANET,"Frasier. Yes, He's right here. Sir?"
0,77,12,GH,"Hammond. Yes --- allright, thank you. We got a lead on Steven Rayner. He boarded a flight to Cairo 4 hours ago."
0,77,12,DANNY,"He could be headed back to the temple in Egypt where the jars were discovered. If we move fast, we could head him off, Sir."
0,77,12,GH,I can alert the Egyptian authorities. This needs to be a low profile operation. Dr. Frasier will accompany you.
0,77,13,JANET,I think I know why this place doesn't get any tourists.
0,77,13,SAM,(Taking off her hat and rubbing her hair.
0,77,15,DANNY,It's Steven!
0,77,15,SAM,I'm not sencing anything. He's not Goa'Uld.
0,77,16,DANNY,Steven!
0,77,16,JANET,: He's bleeding internally.
0,77,16,DANNY,"Steven, it's me."
0,77,16,STEVEN,Daniel?
0,77,16,DANNY,What happened?
0,77,16,STEVEN,"I took the amulet. It's over 10,000 years old. You --- were right all along. I'm sorry. AHHH!"
0,77,16,JANET,"Just take it easy, OK? I need you to hold still."
0,77,16,DANNY,It's OK! She's a friend. What about the jar?
0,77,16,STEVEN,Huh?
0,77,16,DANNY,The Osiris Jar. Did you open it?
0,77,16,STEVEN,No.
0,77,16,DANNY,Why did you come here?
0,77,16,STEVEN,I figured out the amulet was a key. There's a hidden chamber. I wanted to make the discovery.
0,77,16,JANET,"Daniel, we HAVE to get him out of here!"
0,77,16,DANNY,"Steven, who did this to you?"
0,77,16,SARAH / OSIRIS,(Eyes a glow
0,77,17,DANNY,Sarah?!
0,77,18,OSIRIS,
0,77,18,DANNY,I don't know what you're talking about.
0,77,18,OSIRIS,
0,77,18,DANNY,"Yeah? Well, times have changed."
0,77,18,DANNY,"Ah, you mean SETH. Uh --- He's dead. Yeah, we killed him."
0,77,18,YOU LIE!,
0,77,18,DANNY,"No! No, we also killed RA, and HATHOR, and uh --- who else? Ah, SOKAR!"
0,77,18,DANNY,"No! No, you won't rule at all, see we don't worship false gods anymore."
0,77,18,DANNY,"Um --- She was trapped, like you. We have the jar."
0,77,18,WHERE IS IT?,
0,77,18,DANNY,I'm not gonna tell you.
0,77,18,OSIRIS,
0,77,18,WHAT IS THIS?! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!,
0,77,19,SAM,You all right?
0,77,19,DANNY,"Oh, yeah! Yeah! I think I'm --- getting used to that thing!"
0,77,19,JANET,Where's Osiris?
0,77,19,SAM,Gone.
0,77,19,DANNY,Steven?
0,77,19,JANET,"If we get him out of here right now, I think he'll make it."
0,77,19,DANNY,I guess we'd better --- make up a story to tell him.
