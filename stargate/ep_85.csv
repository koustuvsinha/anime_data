0,85,0,"""DOUBLE JEOPARDY""",By Robert C. Cooper
0,85,1,CLONE TEAL'C,O'Neill! Footprints and they are recent.
0,85,1,CLONE O'NEILL,How many?
0,85,1,CLONE TEAL'C,Several. Some are that of Jaffa.
0,85,2,CLONE CARTER,Take cover!
0,85,3,JAFFA,Drop your weapons and surrender!
0,85,3,CLONE DANIEL,They don't look like Jaffa.
0,85,3,CLONE CARTER,He does.
0,85,3,JAFFA,There is no escape. Stand and identify yourselves.
0,85,3,DARIAN,They need not. I know who they are.
0,85,3,CLONE DANIEL,"I'm sorry, have we. have we met?"
0,85,3,DARIAN,They are warriors from a planet called Earth. They are known as SG1. How dare you return here?
0,85,3,CLONE DANIEL,Look I think there's been a misunderstanding.
0,85,3,DARIAN,"They are the ones who led us in the rebellion against the servants of Heru'er. You told us to bury our Stargate. You said that the Gods would not return, but that was not true. Chronus came in his great ship. He claimed our planet, commanded that we serve him."
0,85,3,CLONE CARTER,I'm sorry about what's happened but you don't understand.
0,85,3,DARIAN,"Why do you insult me Major Carter. Would you have me believe you have not been here? I know who you are. You are Daniel Jackson, Teal'c and that is Colonel O'Neill."
0,85,4,JAFFA,Where is he? Find him! Bring them.
0,85,6,DARIAN,Hail Cindar. Loyal servant of Chronus.
0,85,6,CINDAR,Who is this?
0,85,6,JAFFA,They came through the Chappa'ai.
0,85,6,DARIAN,They are the ones who came before and fought against the servants of Heru'er.
0,85,6,CINDAR,You are the shol'va Teal'c. My master will be most pleased.
0,85,6,JAFFA,There is another who was with them. He escaped into the forest.
0,85,6,DARIAN,He is their leader.
0,85,6,CINDAR,Find him.
0,85,6,DARIAN,We will not fail you.
0,85,7,DARIAN,Goodnight Heera.
0,85,7,HEERA,Goodnight husband.
0,85,7,DARIAN,Chronus comes tomorrow. I pray that he will reward us kindly for having captured the warriors from planet Earth. I fear Chronus will be disappointed that our search parties have been unable to capture their leader. Is something wrong? You behave strangely.
0,85,9,CLONE CARTER,That Darian guy called me Major.
0,85,9,CLONE DANIEL,Well this was a major screw up.
0,85,9,CLONE CARTER,Well how could we know?
0,85,9,CLONE TEAL'C,There is always the risk that planets we explore may be occupied by Goa'uld forces.
0,85,9,CLONE DANIEL,"Yes, but one we've actually been to before?"
0,85,9,CLONE CARTER,Do you think it's a bad sign Colonel O'Neill hasn't tried to communicate yet?
0,85,9,CLONE TEAL'C,I do not. I do not believe we should attempt to communicate with him either. The Goa'uld may have means of tracking our signal.
0,85,9,CLONE CARTER,Mission time's approaching 8 hours. What are we gonna do?
0,85,9,CLONE DANIEL,Well we can't tell them the truth.
0,85,10,DARIAN,I do not understand.
0,85,10,CLONE O'NEILL,I know how you feel.
0,85,10,DARAIN,There are two of you?
0,85,10,CLONE O'NEILL,"Ahh, it's more complicated than that."
0,85,10,DARIAN,"Please, do not hurt my wife."
0,85,10,CLONE O'NEILL,I'm not gonna hurt either one of you. I just want someone to explain to me what happened here before I arrived.
0,85,10,DARIAN,Do you mean the first time you were here?
0,85,10,CLONE O'NEILL,Mmm mm
0,85,10,DARIAN,"You came through the Chappa'ai. You said that our God, Heru'er was a false God. You organised a rebellion. With your help we banished Heru'er's jaffa. You said that we were free and the false Gods would not bother us again. We did live in peace for a time but eventually Chronus came in his ship and declared that our planet now fell under his domain. He commanded that we worship him."
0,85,10,CLONE O'NEILL,"Alright, look. Neither one of those guys is a God okay."
0,85,10,DARIAN,I will not believe you this time. The punishment my people suffered for our prior indiscretion was my fault. I asked them to follow you and they were forced to pay dearly for it.
0,85,10,CLONE O'NEILL,It was not an indiscretion. It was the right thing to do no matter how it turned out.
0,85,10,DARIAN,Do what you will. Tomorrow Chronus comes and you and the rest of your kind will face the consequences.
0,85,10,CLONE O'NEILL,"Yeah, whatever."
0,85,10,DARIAN,There will be no escape.
0,85,10,CLONE O'NEILL,Close your eyes. Close your eyes please.
0,85,10,DARIAN,How long are we to remain like this?
0,85,13,CINDAR,My Lord. Your presence honours me.
0,85,13,CHRONUS,Tell me of the intruders from Earth.
0,85,13,CINDAR,There were three. And the Jaffa Teal'c. Shol'va. The one called O'Neill has thus far eluded capture.
0,85,14,DARIAN,Warriors of Juna. We are called before Chronus.
0,85,16,CHRONUS,Warriors of Juna. For your loyalty you shall be rewarded.
0,85,17,CHRONUS,Bring in the prisoners.
0,85,18,CHRONUS,The treaty between the system Lords and the Asgard does not protect you here. I once told you if you were ever at my mercy I would not be kind. You will not be fortunate to die as quickly as your father did by my hand. Shol'va! Your fate will be much worse. You will all pay for your sins. Come forward.
0,85,19,DARIAN,I do my Lord.
0,85,20,CHRONUS,Take it.
0,85,21,CHRONUS,"In honour of your God, kill him. Hashack Kree! Kill him!"
0,85,23,TECH,Receiving IDC. Sir we're receiving the signal on the IDC frequency but this is not an authorised SGC code.
0,85,23,CARTER,It says Comtraya.
0,85,23,HAMMOND,What does it mean?
0,85,23,O'NEILL,"Ahh, it's kinda like shalome or aloha, that stuff."
0,85,23,TEAL'C,It was the greeting used by the artificial life form Harlan on PX3989.
0,85,23,HAMMOND,The one who duplicated you?
0,85,23,O'NEILL,"Yes, Sir please don't open the Gate, please."
0,85,23,CARTER,I admit he was annoying but he wasn't a serious threat.
0,85,23,HAMMOND,Open the iris.
0,85,24,HARLAN,Ohh ohh I have no weapons.
0,85,24,HAMMOND,Stand down.
0,85,24,HARLAN,Oh thank you for opening the doorway device that you call iris.
0,85,24,O'NEILL,"Just for the record, I was opposed."
0,85,25,HAMMOND,"Welcome to Earth. I'm General Hammond, leader of this facility."
0,85,25,HARLAN,"Comtraya. Yes, I have heard so much about you."
0,85,25,CARTER,What's wrong Harlan?
0,85,25,HARLAN,"Oh please yes, it is a very big emergency. You must help you."
0,85,26,CHRONUS,What are you? Speak! Speak or I'll shall have you torn apart. Bring them to the ship. Find the other one!
0,85,26,JAFFA,Yes my Lord.
0,85,27,HARLAN,"I told them not to go. I begged them. Going through the Stargate is dangerous, very very dangerous. You told me all about the Goa'uld, you did. You must help, yes, no?"
0,85,27,O'NEILL,Harlan!
0,85,27,HARLAN,Yes?
0,85,27,O'NEILL,Sit!
0,85,27,HARLAN,Yes.
0,85,27,O'NEILL,"Now, from the beginning."
0,85,27,HARLAN,"The beginning, yes. They were not happy, they could not stop being you. The portable power pack you invented.."
0,85,27,CARTER,The robot me?
0,85,27,HARLAN,"Oh it was ingenious. Even Hubald would have been impressed. I have one in my chest now, would you like to see it?"
0,85,27,CARTER,Yes.
0,85,27,O'NEILL,No! You can show her later.
0,85,27,HARLAN,Later yes. Help first.
0,85,27,TEAL'C,What type of help do you require?
0,85,27,HARLAN,Oh not me. You. I mean the others.
0,85,27,HAMMOND,What exactly has happened?
0,85,27,HARLAN,Well they have not returned.
0,85,27,CARTER,Where are they?
0,85,27,HARLAN,"Away, they go away."
0,85,27,CARTER,Are you saying our robot selves are going through the Stargate on missions?
0,85,27,HARLAN,"Missions, yes."
0,85,27,O'NEILL,What for?
0,85,27,HARLAN,I do not really know. What is it that you do?
0,85,27,HAMMOND,"Colonel O'Neill, it was my understanding that the robots agreed to bury their Stargate and never leave their planet."
0,85,27,O'NEILL,Yes Sir.
0,85,27,HAMMOND,Then it would seem your robot counterpart is equally as good at following orders as you.
0,85,27,HARLAN,They have always returned after 24 hours. For safety. The power packs only last for 48 hours and they must be recharged.
0,85,27,CARTER,How overdue are they?
0,85,27,HARLAN,16 hours. They do not have much time left. Ohhhh.
0,85,29,HEERA,What is it? What has happened?
0,85,29,DARIAN,"It was unlike anything I have ever seen. Chronus brought the prisoners before us. I was given a weapon of the Gods. To demonstrate my loyalty, Chronus instructed me to kill the one called Daniel Jackson."
0,85,29,HEERA,And so?
0,85,29,DARIAN,"I fired the weapon. What happened next was unholy. I have seen men decapitated in battle, what I saw was not human. That was not the most disturbing thing."
0,85,29,HEERA,What was?
0,85,29,DARIAN,Chronus was as shocked by the fact that Daniel Jackson was not human as the rest of us. He sent us away immediately.
0,85,29,HEERA,But how could a true God be surprised by anything?
0,85,29,DARIAN,That is what I ask myself.
0,85,30,O'NEILL,"General, I really don't think we're responsible for retrieving these robots."
0,85,30,HARLAN,But you must. They are you.
0,85,30,O'NEILL,Not me they're not.
0,85,30,HARLAN,Where is Doctor Jackson? He will help.
0,85,30,CARTER,He's on a mission at the moment.
0,85,30,HARLAN,Ohhh you do that so much.
0,85,30,HAMMOND,The fact is I don't want to risk any of my people for the sake of some androids you created without authorisation. However.
0,85,30,HARLAN,"However, yes?"
0,85,30,HAMMOND,I am worried that information about this facility could potentially fall into the wrong hands.
0,85,30,HARLAN,Ah an excellent point.
0,85,30,CARTER,"Sirs if I may, our robots are really so much like us they probably couldn't resist the chance to use the Gate to explore. I think then we can also assume that they would guard any top-secret information as closely as we would. Besides they don't have our IDC codes so they can't give those away."
0,85,30,HAMMOND,"Colonel O'Neill, if you don't want to take this on, I'm not going to make it an order."
0,85,30,O'NEILL,Thank you Sir.
0,85,30,HARLAN,But I have grown accustomed. I cannot go on without them.
0,85,30,CARTER,Sorry.
0,85,30,HARLAN,Then I shall just have to help myself.
0,85,32,HARLAN,This one. This one. That one. This one. That one and this one.
0,85,32,CARTER,Hmm.
0,85,32,O'NEILL,Hmm what?
0,85,32,CARTER,That's what I thought. P2X 729. We've been to this planet before.
0,85,32,TEAL'C,We did engage in battle with the Jaffa of Heru'er. And liberated the people of Juna.
0,85,32,CARTER,That's right. We told them to bury the Gate after we were gone. Are you sure you've got the right address?
0,85,32,HARLAN,I could do a full diagnostic of my systems but it might be quicker to just dial the address.
0,85,32,HAMMOND,Proceed.
0,85,32,CARTER,Yes Sir.
0,85,34,TECH,Chevron 6 encoded. Chevron 7 locked.
0,85,35,CARTER,The Gate isn't buried.
0,85,35,TEAL'C,It is possible the Goa'uld travelled to the planet by ship in order to reinstate command.
0,85,35,CARTER,"Heru'er is dead, the Naquada mine was dry, those people didn't pose any threat."
0,85,35,TEAL'C,Another Goa'uld may have claimed the planet for different reasons.
0,85,35,O'NEILL,Why?
0,85,35,TEAL'C,Possibly strategic military position.
0,85,35,CARTER,We told them they'd be okay.
0,85,35,HAMMOND,Send a probe. Let's find out.
0,85,35,CARTER,Yes Sir.
0,85,37,CARTER,Receiving MALP telemetry.
0,85,38,O'NEILL,Woah. I'll never get used to that.
0,85,38,HAMMOND,This is General Hammond of the SGC.
0,85,38,CLONE O'NEILL,"Hey George, how you doing? Who else you got there with you?"
0,85,38,HAMMOND,"Major Carter, Teal'c, Colonel O'Neill and Harlan."
0,85,38,CLONE O'NEILL,Harlan! I told you to stay away from Earth.
0,85,38,O'NEILL,Yeah well I told you to bury your gate.
0,85,38,CLONE O'NEILL,Well you seem to think that solves a lot of problems don'tcha?
0,85,38,HAMMOND,
0,85,38,HARLAN,I'm sorry. I did not know what else to do. Please return to our planet.
0,85,38,CLONE O'NEILL,I can't do that just yet.
0,85,39,DARIAN,Do not shoot. I wish to help you.
0,85,39,CLONE O'NEILL,Why?
0,85,39,DARIAN,I now believe you spoke the truth about everything. Including the Gods.
0,85,39,CLONE O'NEILL,Why should I believe you?
0,85,39,DARIAN,You must trust me as I must trust you. I am sorry about the one called Daniel.
0,85,39,CLONE O'NEILL,Get over here.
0,85,39,DARIAN,To whom are you speaking?
0,85,39,CARTER,That's Darian.
0,85,39,CLONE O'NEILL,Earth. George Hammond and the other
0,85,39,O'NEILL,"Hey! You're the other, pal."
0,85,39,CLONE O'NEILL,Do we really have time for semantics here?
0,85,39,HAMMOND,What exactly is the current situation?
0,85,39,CLONE O'NEILL,Our Daniel is dead.
0,85,39,HARLAN,Oh my.
0,85,39,CLONE O'NEILL,Carter and Teal'c have been captured by Chronus. He's got a ship in orbit and his jaffa are everywhere. So it's just Darian and me.
0,85,39,DARIAN,"Please, help us."
0,85,39,HAMMOND,You have a go. SG-1 is on its way.
0,85,39,CLONE O'NEILL,"Thank's George. Harlan, you stay there."
0,85,40,GOA'ULD WOMAN,They appear to be a fascinating technology.
0,85,40,CHRONUS,Find out how they work. I wish to know all the information they contain.
0,85,40,GOA'ULD WOMAN,My pleasure.
0,85,41,DARIAN,This way.
0,85,42,DARIAN,They look very much like you.
0,85,42,CARTER,We know.
0,85,42,O'NEILL,"Listen, for what it's worth, I'm sorry about what's happened here."
0,85,42,CLONE O'NEILL,Oh I'm sure that makes him feel better.
0,85,42,O'NEILL,Hey. What the hell do you think you're doing?
0,85,42,CLONE O'NEILL,Same thing you do. Only better.
0,85,42,O'NEILL,What does that mean?
0,85,42,CLONE O'NEILL,"Better? It means bet-ter, stronger, faster."
0,85,42,O'NEILL,You're not me and you don't work for the Air Force.
0,85,42,CLONE O'NEILL,No. But that doesn't mean I can't do the job.
0,85,42,O'NEILL,What job?
0,85,42,CLONE O'NEILL,Explore the universe. Fight the Goa'uld.
0,85,42,O'NEILL,"Oh what, like now?"
0,85,42,CLONE O'NEILL,Oh you made this mess.
0,85,42,O'NEILL,What we did was help these people.
0,85,42,CLONE O'NEILL,"Oh come on, I know you better than that. You screwed up and now you're embarrassed."
0,85,42,O'NEILL,Well that's not the point.
0,85,42,CLONE O'NEILL,And like I'm gonna spend my eternity on that lame ass planet? Sheesh.
0,85,42,O'NEILL,You gave me your word.
0,85,42,CLONE O'NEILL,"Oh is this the first time you've lied to yourself? I told you what you wanted to hear. Besides, what were you gonna do? Destroy me?"
0,85,42,O'NEILL,I might have.
0,85,42,CLONE O'NEILL,Alright come on bring it on flyboy. Let's go. Come on.
0,85,42,O'NEILL,Oh you little.
0,85,43,CARTER,"Sirs. As much as I would like to see how this plays out, don't we have something more important to do?"
0,85,43,DARIAN,What can so few of us possibly do?
0,85,43,CLONE O'NEILL,Couldn't get Hammond to spring for more troops?
0,85,43,O'NEILL,I didn't ask. This is our problem.
0,85,43,CARTER,I guess we can't expect any help from the rest of the Juan people?
0,85,43,DARIAN,No.
0,85,43,TEAL'C,We convinced your people to oppose the Goa'uld once before.
0,85,43,DARIAN,"Most, including myself, had never seen an actual God before. Heru'er had not come to Juna for many generations. And when Chronus arrived and displayed his great power he instilled much fear. The people are terrified."
0,85,43,TEAL'C,Then we must demonstrate to your people once and for all that Chronus is not a God.
0,85,43,CLONE O'NEILL,I suppose you have a plan to back up that rather bold yet cryptic statement?
0,85,43,O'NEILL,Yes. Yes we do.
0,85,44,DARIAN,It is not safe to stay here. The forests are heavily patrolled.
0,85,44,CLONE O'NEILL,We're not done pal.
0,85,44,O'NEILL,I so own you.
0,85,46,GOA'ULD WOMAN,There is a device embedded in the chest that sensors indicate may be a power unit. Current status: Deactivated. Can it be reactivated? Do you feel pain? Affirmative. Do you sympathise with him?
0,85,46,CLONE TEAL'C,No!
0,85,46,GOA'ULD WOMAN,Both units appear to show concern for each other. Tell me how to reactivate this one's power unit. Then tell me which one of you would like to feel sympathy and which one pain?
0,85,47,CLONE O'NEILL,The only rings I've seen were in that pyramid.
0,85,47,TEAL'C,There is a way into the main chamber.
0,85,47,CLONE O'NEILL,"Yeah, by putting the robot at risk."
0,85,47,O'NEILL,"Well fine, I'll do it."
0,85,47,CLONE O'NEILL,"It's alright, I can handle it."
0,85,47,DARIAN,This is very strange to me.
0,85,47,CARTER,This kind of stuff happens to us all the time.
0,85,47,CLONE O'NEILL,So how many jaffa are we gonna have to deal with on that ship?
0,85,47,TEAL'C,As many as one thousand. But that is not the problem.
0,85,47,O'NEILL,What is the problem?
0,85,47,TEAL'C,The rings must be activated from within the ship.
0,85,47,O'NEILL,"Now see, you didn't mention that before."
0,85,47,TEAL'C,We had very little time to formulate this plan O'Neill.
0,85,47,CLONE O'NEILL,It's alright. Carter and Teal'c might be able to help. The other one's.
0,85,47,O'NEILL,How are they gonna know what to do and when?
0,85,47,CLONE O'NEILL,I can communicate with them. I've been maintaining radio silence to protect my location.
0,85,47,O'NEILL,I don't see a radio.
0,85,47,CLONE O'NEILL,They're internal.
0,85,47,CARTER,So you can actually send a signal.
0,85,47,CLONE O'NEILL,Wait. Excuse me. A little static. They said they'd do what they can.
0,85,47,O'NEILL,What about the Jaffa on the ship?
0,85,47,TEAL'C,"Once we have reached the pel'tac, the other levels can be sealed off. Chronus will have very few jaffa remaining for support."
0,85,47,CARTER,What do we with the other jaffa once we've dealt with Chronus and taken over the ship?
0,85,47,TEAL'C,Offer them freedom.
0,85,48,GOA'ULD WOMAN,My Lord. The machine that resembles the jaffa Teal'c requests an audience with you.
0,85,48,CHRONUS,For what purpose?
0,85,48,GOA'ULD WOMAN,He claims he wishes to bargain with you for the freedom of the one called Carter.
0,85,48,CHRONUS,What have you learned so far?
0,85,48,GOA'ULD WOMAN,"They have been unwilling to co-operate in the analysis however, their behaviour is curiously similar to that of humans."
0,85,49,CHRONUS,Bring the one that resembles Teal'c before me.
0,85,50,CINDAR,Report?
0,85,50,JAFFA,The intruder has been captured.
0,85,53,GOA'ULD WOMAN,Tell me how to operate the power core on that unit and I will stop damaging you.
0,85,53,CLONE CARTER,It's simple. Just touch the two crystals on opposite sides of the converter.
0,85,53,GOA'ULD WOMAN,Interesting.
0,85,54,CINDAR,Chronus will be pleased.
0,85,54,DARIAN,"Truth be told, I do not think Chronus will be pleased at all."
0,85,55,O'NEILL,You all right?
0,85,55,DARIAN,I am.
0,85,55,CLONE O'NEILL,I'm fine too. Thanks for your concern.
0,85,55,O'NEILL,Are you alright?
0,85,55,CLONE O'NEILL,"A little gas. Yeah, got gas."
0,85,56,CHRONUS,What is it you wish to tell me in exchange for the other one's freedom?
0,85,56,CLONE TEAL'C,I only wish to seek revenge for the death of my father.
0,85,58,GOA'ULD WOMAN,Is it now active?
0,85,58,CLONE CARTER,In a way.
0,85,58,GOA'ULD WOMAN,What does this mean?
0,85,58,CLONE CARTER,I designed it with special sensors to detect when someone was tampering with the power core. Situations just like this. It's a self-destruct mode.
0,85,60,JAFFA2,Go.
0,85,64,O'NEILL,Nice work.
0,85,64,CLONE CARTER,Teal'c's in trouble.
0,85,64,TEAL'C,Where?
0,85,64,CLONE CARTER,He's on the pel'tac with Chronus.
0,85,65,O'NEILL,We need to seal off this level.
0,85,65,CARTER,Apparently there's a control centre somewhere that services all the doors. Kinda like a circuit panel.
0,85,66,CHRONUS,Jaffa Kree!
0,85,68,CLONE CARTER,I've got your six.
0,85,72,CARTER,The crystals are protected by a force shield.
0,85,72,CLONE CARTER,Switch with me I'll do it.
0,85,73,CLONE CARTER,What do I do?
0,85,73,CARTER,Pull the green crystals out. The doors should close and lock automatically.
0,85,76,CLONE TEAL'C,For our father.
0,85,80,O'NEILL,That's it.
0,85,82,DARIAN,You were very badly damaged.
0,85,82,CLONE O'NEILL,Yes.
0,85,82,DARIAN,But you are a machine. Can you not be mended?
0,85,82,CLONE O'NEILL,"Possibly. Darian, I'm running out of energy. I will shut down soon."
0,85,82,DARIAN,"I promise, you will never be forgotten."
0,85,83,O'NEILL,"Go tell your people Chronus is dead. If they still think he's a God, have `em come take a look."
0,85,83,CLONE O'NEILL,"Carter, Teal'c?"
0,85,83,O'NEILL,"Yours don't look so good. The real ones, they're okay."
0,85,83,CLONE O'NEILL,Are we still so far from real to you?
0,85,83,O'NEILL,No. I guess not.
0,85,83,CLONE O'NEILL,Then I believe we are done.
