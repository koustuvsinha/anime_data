0,87,0,"""ENEMIES""",By Robert C. Cooper
0,87,0,SAM,This is the sun in Vorash's orbit.
0,87,0,JACOB,We wanna blow it up.
0,87,1,JACK,What the hell is that?
0,87,1,JACOB,We're under attack! Hyperdrive's down. We're sitting ducks!
0,87,1,TEAL'C,We must not allow Tannith to escape.
0,87,2,JACK,Teal'C ... PULL UP! Mayday! mayday! We are SO going in!
0,87,2,DANNY,Jack? Can you hear me?
0,87,3,JACOB,We have less that 4 minutes until the sun begins to supernova.
0,87,3,JACK,"Daniel, just get me the hell out of here, will ya?!!!"
0,87,3,JACOB,Engaging hyperdrive.
0,87,3,CARTER,Sir! Where's Teal'C?
0,87,3,JACK,I think he's dead.
0,87,3,JACOB,We've traveled over 4 million light years.
0,87,3,SAM,That's impossible.
0,87,3,JACOB,It's gonna take 125 years to get back. It's Apophis!
0,87,3,JACOB,He's arming weapons.
0,87,3,JACK,Shields?
0,87,3,JACOB,Not responding. Not that they'd do much good anyway. That ship has weapons powerful enough to penatrate our shields at full power.
0,87,3,SAM,Hyperdrive?
0,87,3,JACOB,It's not responding. The blast wave that propelled us here did some damage.
0,87,3,DANNY,Can we communicate with them?
0,87,3,JACOB,And say what?
0,87,3,DANNY,I don't know ... don't shoot??
0,87,3,JACK,Commander?
0,87,3,JACOB,You wanna bicker about rank now?
0,87,3,APOPHIS,
0,87,3,JACK,He's looking a little pissed.
0,87,3,SAM,We DID just destroy his fleet.
0,87,4,JACOB,He says it's time for us to die.
0,87,4,DANNY,"Uh ... wait a second. I don't know if you've checked your dashboard here, but we're both way off course."
0,87,4,JACOB,He says he knows everything. He's also saying there's nothing we could do to help him. He's going to destroy us.
0,87,4,DANNY,We surrender.
0,87,4,JACK,What?! Danny?!
0,87,4,DANNY,"We say that or he blows us to pieces, I thought I'd buy us some time here."
0,87,5,SAM,What'd he say?
0,87,5,DANNY,Too late.
0,87,5,JACK,I can't stand it! What's he waiting for?
0,87,6,SAM,What happened?
0,87,6,JACOB,I'm picking up another ship on sensors. It's comming in fast ... and it's firering on Apophis.
0,87,6,SAM,What are you doing?
0,87,6,JACOB,Getting the hell out of here. That ship is unlike anything I've ever seen.
0,87,6,SAM,"Well, we are in a completely uncharted part of the universe."
0,87,6,JACK,"I'm enjoying their style ... shoot first, send flowers later. It works!"
0,87,6,DANNY,"And only at Apophis, not us."
0,87,6,SAM,"Well, his ship's a much bigger craft."
0,87,6,JACOB,You think they were trying to save us?
0,87,6,DANNY,It's possible.
0,87,6,JACOB,We may still find out; we're not gonna get far on sublight engines ... whoever wins the fight is gonna come looking for us.
0,87,6,SAM,"Now, what are you doing?"
0,87,6,JACOB,"This system is centered around a blue giant star. If we can move close enough to the choronisphere, the radiation should keep us well hidden."
0,87,6,JACK,Excuse me? Radiation?
0,87,6,JACOB,"Well, the ship's hull will protect us ... for a while. We're entering the choronisphere. The good news is that we won't show up in anyone else's sensors. The bad news is that our sensors will be blocked as well."
0,87,6,SAM,"So when we're ready to go, we won't know if anyone's out there waiting for us."
0,87,6,DANNY,How long do we have?
0,87,6,JACOB,About an hour without full shields. Ten hours with em. Sam ... wanna give me a hand?
0,87,6,JACK,I'd fix the shields first.
0,87,6,JACOB,"Right, Jack."
0,87,6,JACK,Just a suggestion.
0,87,6,JACOB,Are you
0,87,6,SAM,Just thinking about Teal'C. Five minutes.
0,87,6,JACOB,"Then nine hours. The shields are back online. Oh, boy!"
0,87,6,SAM,How bad is it?
0,87,6,JACOB,It's bad! The hyperdrive control chrystals are all completely shot.
0,87,6,SAM,We allready used the back ups.
0,87,6,DANNY,I don't suppose you wanna talk about what happened on Vorash.
0,87,6,JACK,Not really.
0,87,6,DANNY,Didn't think so.
0,87,6,JACK,We were ambushed. At the rings. Teal'C took one in the back. I should have seen it coming.
0,87,6,DANNY,"I thought the key to a good ambush is that you DON'T see it coming. Look, the point is, I'm SURE you did your best."
0,87,6,JACK,Apparently it wasn't good enough.
0,87,7,SERGENT WALTER DAVIS,"recieving tokra IDC, Sir."
0,87,7,GH,Open the iris. Stand down! Welcome to Earth. I'm General Hammond.
0,87,7,TOK'RA,> I'M
0,87,7,GH,Would you please come this way? I assume you have news.
0,87,7,GH,As far as you can tell?
0,87,7,GH,And there's been no communication from
0,87,7,GH,Apophis?
0,87,7,GH,Than who was it?
0,87,7,GH,"So, you're saying that SG1 did not survive?"
0,87,7,COUNCILWOMAN,
0,87,7,GH,Thank you.
0,87,7,COUNCILWOMAN,
0,87,7,GH,You'll forgive me for holding out hope a little longer? SG1 has a surprisingly good habit of beating the odds.
0,87,8,JACOB,This is not gonna work!
0,87,8,JACK,"Hey, uh ... it's getting a little hot up here, kids."
0,87,8,SAM,We're running out of time!
0,87,8,JACOB,>The hyperdrive is history.
0,87,8,SAM,"We tried retrofitting some of the other chrystal, but it didn't work."
0,87,8,DANNY,I though you said it would take over a hundread years to get home even if we had the hyperdrive.
0,87,8,JACOB,Yeah.
0,87,8,DANNY,"So in the longrun, what difference does it make?"
0,87,8,JACOB,"Well, in the short term it would be hard to avoid enemy ships."
0,87,8,JACK,Weapons and shields?
0,87,8,SAM,Good for now.
0,87,8,JACK,Good enough to cover our butts from whatever's out there?
0,87,8,JACOB,We'll see. Moving out of the choronosphere. Sensors are coming back online. Picking up one ship. It's Apophis.
0,87,8,JACK,What about the other one?
0,87,8,JACOB,It's not out there!
0,87,8,DANNY,Can Apophis see us yet?
0,87,8,JACOB,"He should be able to, but he's not warning."
0,87,8,SAM,MAybe his ship was damaged in the battle. That's impossible!
0,87,8,JACK,Care to share?
0,87,8,DANNY,It says that there's no lifesigns onboard.
0,87,8,SAM,What if the Alien ship comes back while we're over there?
0,87,8,JACOB,"Without hyperdrives, we're sitting ducks no matter where we are. If Apophis's ship is damaged, and we can revere it, We should. It's faster, has more advanced weapondry, and surperior shields."
0,87,8,JACK,We still gotta span em.
0,87,8,JACOB,"We won't know what happened until we get there. At the very least, we need hyperdrive control."
0,87,9,JACK,What's he saying?
0,87,9,JACOB,Self distruct is set. We have 4 minutes. I'll try to shut it off from the peltak. Sam? You know where the chrystals are?
0,87,9,SAM,I'll get them.
0,87,9,JACOB,All right.
0,87,9,SAM,"This way, Sir. It's not far."
0,87,9,JACK,Carter? How do you know where to go in a place like this?
0,87,9,SAM,I studied certain respects of the ship while we were on Vorash.
0,87,9,JACK,"You know how to have a good time, don't you?"
0,87,9,SAM,"I'm having a good time now, Sir."
0,87,9,JACK,You GO girl.
0,87,9,SAM,Clear.
0,87,9,JACK,What is it?
0,87,9,SAM,I don't know. That sounds erily familiar.
0,87,9,JACK,"Jacob, do you read me?"
0,87,9,JACOB,Yeah.
0,87,9,JACK,Uh ... we should get out of here.
0,87,9,JACOB,"Yeah, I figured that."
0,87,9,DANNY,"Guys, what's going on?"
0,87,9,SAM,The ship's crawling with replicators.
0,87,9,JACOB,"Sam, I'm not gonna be able to shut off the autodestruct. I'll meet you 2 back at the ring room."
0,87,9,SAM,We're still gonna try to get the crystals.
0,87,9,JACOB,"You have 3 minutes. Daniel, you're gonna haveta fly that ship out of here as soon as we ring back aboard ..."
0,87,9,DANNY,... and you're gonna haveta tell me how to do that!
0,87,9,JACOB,"Running thru the corridor, arrives at the EMPTY ring room) Sam, Jack ... one minute! Sam! Jack! Do you read!?!"
0,87,9,SAM,Activate the rings!!!! We got em.
0,87,9,JACOB,"Go, Daniel!"
0,87,9,SAM,There's not enough time to fix the hyperdrive is there?
0,87,9,JACOB,We're gonna haveta hope the sublet engines get us far enough away!
0,87,9,SAM,Of course That's only gonna matter if the replicators can't shut off the auto destruct.
0,87,9,JACOB,Unless they learn to reprogram a Goa'Uld computer rather quickly.
0,87,9,SAM,It's possible. If they get control of that ship ...
0,87,9,JACK,
0,87,9,JACOB,We're not gonna make it!
0,87,9,DANNY,We're gone as fast as we can!
0,87,9,JACOB,All right! Shut down the engines! Avert all power to the shields.
0,87,9,DANNY,Be my GUEST!
0,87,9,JACOB,That was close.
0,87,9,JACK,I believe someone said ... we're not gonna make it.
0,87,9,JACOB,"Sam, let's get the hyperdrive running."
0,87,9,JACK,"Excuse me. I distinctly remember someone saying ""We're not gonna make it!"" I think we made it."
0,87,9,JACOB,"I'm sorry, I overreacted. At the time it seemed we weren't gonna make it."
0,87,9,JACK,"Yes! Well, next time, maybe we'll just wait and see."
0,87,9,JACOB,And blow the last chance I'll ever have to being right?
0,87,9,JACK,What?
0,87,9,SAM,Welcome to MY life!
0,87,9,JACOB,We're good to go!
0,87,9,DANNY,"Uh ... engine room, this is Peltack, engine room, come in immediately!"
0,87,9,JACOB,I think we've left him in charge once too often.
0,87,9,SAM,What is it Daniel?
0,87,9,DANNY,I'm picking up a ... ship ... on the sensors.
0,87,9,JACOB,Now what? Looks like someone must have escaped Apophis's ship before the bugs took over.
0,87,9,SAM,Who?!
0,87,9,JACOB,It's a Goa'Uld cargo ship. I'm sending a hailing signal. Nothing.
0,87,9,I AM SELMACK OF THE TOK'RA. COMMANDER,
0,87,9,JACK,"You know, we really should talk about this commander thing."
0,87,9,SELMACK,
0,87,9,TEAL'C!!!!,
0,87,9,TEAL'C,O'Neill.
0,87,9,JACK,You made it!
0,87,9,TEAL'C,Apophis revived me in the sarcophagus. We fled the ship when the replicators attacked.
0,87,9,JACK,"""We""?"
0,87,9,JACOB,I'm picking up other lifesigns on board the ship.
0,87,9,JACK,"Who ya got with ya, Teal'C?"
0,87,9,TEAL'C,A few Jaffa who surported our cause. They helped me escape.
0,87,9,JACOB,Opening the cargo bay doors.
0,87,9,JACK,Welcome back.
0,87,9,TEAL'C,"Thank you , O'Neill."
0,87,9,JACK,"Hey! Buddy! Whatcha got goin' here, Teal'C?"
0,87,9,JACK,"Alright, this is ... feeling like a strange plan ... just ... let me know what to do ... and when ... AH! Whoa! OWW!"
0,87,9,DANNY,"Come on, Teal'C, you don't really think you're ... still first prime of Apophis?"
0,87,9,TEAL'C,I have never ceased to be in the service of my GOD.
0,87,9,JACK,All right! That's sounding a little brainwashey to me! You don't believe that guy's a god any more than I do! What the hell's that supposed to mean? Come on! We're friends! You're trying to tell me you don't remember what's happened these last 4 years?
0,87,9,TEAL'C,"I remember everything. It makes me ILL to think I was forced to pretend to be your friend. So many times, I've saved your life when I've wished I could watch you DIE!"
0,87,9,JACK,It hurts me that you would say that ... but ... that's OK ... cause I know it's not true.
0,87,9,TEAL'C,Your belief is not neccessary.
0,87,9,JACK,This doesn't make any sense. Come on! You and I TOGETHER have taken down half a dozen Goa'Ulds.
0,87,9,TEAL'C,Enemies of Apophis.
0,87,9,JACK,"And we kicked his ass twice! Hell, you sat around and watched him DIE once!"
0,87,9,TEAL'C,I knew he would be reborne more powerful than ever!
0,87,9,JACK,I'm talking to a wall here! Anybody?
0,87,9,DANNY,"Teal'C, remember when Apophis brainwashed your son, Ry'Ac? Consider the possibility. ... Or don't."
0,87,9,TEAL'C,Unload the sarcophagus and the crates from the cargo ship.
0,87,9,JACK,I'm starting to wonder why they didn't put us in the brig.
0,87,9,SAM,Probrably cause the lower levels were damaged in the fire fight.
0,87,9,JACK,Think you can hotwire this thing?
0,87,9,SAM,"Well, I assume there's some sort of safety mechonism to ensure against that, I mean, otherwise it'd be pretty STUPID to lock us in here, wouldn't it? Of course, I could give it a shot. ... Sir."
0,87,9,JACK,Thank you.
0,87,10,APOPHIS,
0,87,10,JAFFA,"Course has been plotted for Delmack. Averting all power from shields and weapons, and entering hyperspeed."
0,87,10,APOPHIS,
0,87,10,TEAL'C,"I will see to it personally, My Lord."
0,87,10,"I'M SURE YOU WILL NOT FAIL ME, TEAL'C.",
0,87,11,SAM,I really have no idea what I'm doing here.
0,87,11,JACK,Keep trying. You might get lucky.
0,87,11,SAM,"Sir, I really hate to sound negative, but I think it's pretty safe to say that without more insight into how these things ACTUALLY work, I've got pretty much ZERO chance of actually hitting the ... OK. Maybe not zero."
0,87,11,JACOB,Come on.
0,87,11,TEAL'C,Inside.
0,87,11,JACK,"Come on, Teal'C. A part of you HAS to know the truth."
0,87,11,TEAL'C,"The truth is, you are a prisoner of Apophis. When the symbiote that I carry matures, You will become it's host."
0,87,11,JACK,
0,87,11,JAFFA#2,We will die long before we reach Delmack without new symbiotes!
0,87,11,TEAL'C,Apophis will live on. And we shall serve him well until we die with HONOR in his name.
0,87,11,TEAL'C,Power is being diverted from the hyperdrive engines.
0,87,11,SAM,We just dropped out of hyperspeed.
0,87,11,TEAL'C,"My Lord, the ship's systems are failing. I am unable to bring the ship's engines back online."
0,87,12,JACK,That's odd.
0,87,12,DANNY,Uh-Oh!
0,87,12,JACK,Uh ... excuse me. This could be a problem.
0,87,12,SAM,"Sir, if they've already got control of the ship's primary systems ..."
0,87,12,JACK,... this could be a problem.
0,87,13,SAM,It won't attack you unless threatened.
0,87,13,DANNY,Yeah. We Still maybe should go.
0,87,14,TEAL'C,
0,87,14,HOW?!,
0,87,14,TEAL'C,I am unsure. They control the engine room.
0,87,14,DESTROY THEM!!!,
0,87,14,TEAL'C,"We cannot. There are too many of them, and too few of us. We must ..."
0,87,14,APOPHIS,
0,87,14,JACK,Hello!
0,87,14,SAM,"It's been what? 10, 11 hours since we've picked up the cargo ship? The replicators have have plently enough time to reach unmanageably large numbers."
0,87,14,JACOB,Let's just hope they left the cargo ship alone. It's our only way out of here.
0,87,14,SAM,Chances are they have. I mean they focus on controling the mothership first.
0,87,14,DANNY,"Well, brainwashing or not, we can't just leave Teal'C here."
0,87,14,JACK,I know. You and Jacob secure the cargo ship. Carter? You're with me.
0,87,14,JACOB,You know how to use one of these?
0,87,14,JACK,Sure.
0,87,14,TEAL'C,We must assure that Apophis reached the cargo bay safely.
0,87,14,JAFFA,He is a GOD. Is he powerless against these demons.
0,87,14,TEAL'C,"What you say is blasphamy. If I hear you say it again, I will kill you myself!"
0,87,14,JAFFA,"If our weapons have no effect, what can we do?"
0,87,14,TEAL'C,Human weapons will work. We have crates of them in storage. Jaffa.
0,87,14,JACK,
0,87,14,JACOB,Atmospheric shute is online. Cargo Bay is pressurized.
0,87,14,DANNY,Looks clear. I have what may seem like a dumb question ...
0,87,14,JACOB,Yeah?
0,87,14,DANNY,Don't we need to open those big cargo doors in order to fly this ship out?
0,87,14,JACOB,"Well, this ship has remote access to the door controls. Hopefully the bugs haven't over ridden it."
0,87,14,DANNY,"Youo, you ,you don't wanna ... check?"
0,87,14,JACOB,Uh ... I ... don't wanna tip em off until we have to.
0,87,14,SAM,Sir! We gotta move!
0,87,15,SAM,He's alive.
0,87,15,JACK,"Hope ""Junior"" keeps him that way."
0,87,16,JACK,"Yeah, he ya go!"
0,87,16,DANNY,He's been shot!
0,87,16,JACK,"Yeah, he resisted a little."
0,87,16,DANNY,We were starting to worry you guys wasn't gonna make it.
0,87,16,JACOB,"I didn't say it, though."
0,87,16,JACK,Tie him up! What was that?
0,87,16,JACOB,The mothership just jumped to hyperspeed.
0,87,16,JACK,"Now, what?"
0,87,16,JACOB,"Now ... nothing. We can't open the cargo bay doors and fly out of here while we're in hyperspace. According to this, the ship is headed toward the last set of coordinates that were entered ...Sok'Ar's old planet. Apophis's new base."
0,87,16,SAM,Uh ... dad ...
0,87,16,JACOB,I see. The ship is traveling at 10 X's it's capable hyperspeed?
0,87,16,SAM,And the speed's still increasing ... 12 times ... 20 times ... 30! This is incrediable! The bugs must have modified the engines.
0,87,16,JACOB,They can do that?!
0,87,16,SAM,They can do almost anything. They are very advanced. The individual blocks can come together to achieve what ever pattern they need to achieve their goal.
0,87,16,DANNY,But I thought they didn't care about traveling fast.
0,87,16,SAM,"Only while they're multiplying. Once they've reached a critical number, they look for new technology to consume."
0,87,16,JACOB,"Then the information in the computer about Apophis's base must make them it look pretty apatizing. This is great news! We'll be back in out own galaxy in no time, when they come out of hyperspeed, we can jump ship, and fly home!"
0,87,16,JACK,I wouldn't exactly call that GREAT news.
0,87,16,SAM,We can't let the bugs get a foothold in our galaxy. These things are relentless. Even the asguard haven't been able to stop them.
0,87,16,JACK,What about self-distruct?
0,87,16,SAM,"Right! Once it was set on Apophis's ship, the bugs didn't seem to be able to shut it off."
0,87,16,JACOB,Looks like the bugs have figured out Goa'Uld computers. We can't get into the main system.
0,87,16,JACK,"All right. Come on, let's figure this out! We got em on Thor's ship."
0,87,16,JACOB,How?
0,87,16,SAM,We distroyed the decleration drive just before it entered Earth's atmosphere. It couldn't withstand an uncontrolled reentry.
0,87,16,JACOB,Goa'Uld motherships use sublight engines to slow down after exiting hyperspeed. If we distroy the sublight engines ...
0,87,16,SAM,... the ship won't be able to stop ...
0,87,16,JACOB,... and it'll crash right into Apophis's planet.
0,87,16,SAM,"Now, we would have to wait until just after the ship comes out from hyperspace. So the bugs won't have time to change trajectory."
0,87,16,JACK,All right. How do we distroy these engines?
0,87,16,JACOB,All we have to do is eliminate the control crystals.
0,87,16,SAM,In the engine room?
0,87,16,DANNY,"Which is bug central, probrably."
0,87,16,JACK,So we plant C4.
0,87,16,SAM,The bugs could disable the detinator by the time we leave and set it off.
0,87,16,JACK,What are you saying?
0,87,16,SAM,"To be sure, we would have to PHYSICALLY destroy the crystals ourselves. A P90 at close range would do the job."
0,87,16,JACK,"Oh, no! Now, see? That doesn't sound like a g ..."
0,87,16,JACOB,You got a better idea? Mr. Positive?
0,87,16,SAM,The ship has now reached over 800 times it's previous max. speed.
0,87,16,JACOB,All right! We'll be there pretty soon. One of us has to get the cargo ship charged up and ready to go.
0,87,16,JACK,"That would be you. Carter, Daniel, with me."
0,87,16,JACOB,"It's gonna be tight, guys. You have about 30 seconds to get from the engine room back to the cargo bay."
0,87,16,JACK,Just keep it runnin'.
0,87,16,JACOB,All right. Good luck!
0,87,16,JACK,Oww ... crap!
0,87,16,DANNY,What the hell is that?!
0,87,16,JACK,That ... is a BIG bug!
0,87,16,SAM,I guess that explains the extra power.
0,87,16,JACK,Uh ... listen ... Let's not wake it up.
0,87,16,SAM,
0,87,16,JACK,Whoa! Ready?
0,87,16,SAM,"Wait for it, Sir."
0,87,16,JACK,"Go, go, go, go, go!"
0,87,16,SAM,That's the way we have to go!
0,87,16,JACK,Let's go!
0,87,16,JACOB,Guys! We gotta go now! Jack! Sam! Daniel!
0,87,16,SAM,Dad! We're coming up to the cargo bay! We're finished the ring room on level 2. Can you ring us over multi?
0,87,16,JACOB,I'll try!

0,87,16,JACK,Let's get outta here!
0,87,16,SAM,The doors are closing!
0,87,16,JACOB,They've over riden our control panel.
0,87,16,SAM,Are we gonna make it?
0,87,16,JACOB,"I don't know, Sam."
0,87,17,JACK,I'm gonna go check on Teal'C.
0,87,17,JACOB,Jack. You got his body back. Getting his mind back may not be as easy.
0,87,17,TEAL'C,You may torture me all you wish. I will tell you nothing.
0,87,17,JACK,I'm sorry I had to shoot you. You didn't give me much choice. Apophis ... is dead.
0,87,17,TEAL'C,I do not believe you.
0,87,17,JACK,Trust me.
0,87,17,TEAL'C,
