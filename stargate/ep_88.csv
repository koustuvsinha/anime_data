0,88,0,"""THRESHOLD""",By Brad Wright
0,88,0,HAMMOND,"Master BRATAC, before we proceed..."
0,88,0,BRATAC,We waste time.
0,88,0,HAMMOND,Please explain to me what it is you hope to achieve by depriving TEALC of his symbiote.
0,88,0,BRATAC,I hope to save him.
0,88,0,DANIEL,By killing him.
0,88,0,BRATAC,If necessary.
0,88,0,ONEILL,"See, I think we disagree on the meaning of the word save."
0,88,0,BRATAC,"You would have him remain this way, loving a false god, spitting and cursing?"
0,88,0,ONEILL,No.
0,88,0,CARTER,There may be other methods we havent considered.
0,88,0,BRATAC,"I have seen your methods. You underestimate the hold APOPHIS has on TEALCS heart. In time, you will have little choice but to lock him away, for he is far too dangerous an enemy to have in your midst. The Rite of Malsuraan is the only way."
0,88,0,DANIEL,Last Rite.
0,88,0,BRATAC,"To save TEALCS soul, first we must take him to the very threshold of death. On Chulak, it is said that when a warrior is dying, the events that forged him wash over his mind like a great wave."
0,88,0,DANIEL,"His whole life passes before his eyes, we have a similar...uh, where does that get us?"
0,88,0,BRATAC,"Through his fever and hallucination, he will relive his true path, buried beneath this lie."
0,88,0,ONEILL,Youve done this before?
0,88,0,BRATAC,"Twice, in my 137 years."
0,88,0,CARTER,So you know it works.
0,88,0,BRATAC,Neither Jaffa had the strength to turn back from the precipice. But I am content they died free. TEALC would ask for nothing more. I owe him that. Do you?
0,88,2,FRASIER,"Hes in and out of consciousness. His temperature is rising, his BP is falling, TEALCS immune system is failing. If we dont return his symbiote within the next few hours..."
0,88,2,BRATAC,Do nothing.
0,88,2,FRASIER,I cant do that.
0,88,2,ONEILL,
0,88,2,FRASIER,I see. Then I will take this up with him.
0,88,3,BRATAC,Do you count yourself among TEALCS friends?
0,88,3,FRASIER,Of course.
0,88,3,BRATAC,Then stay. When the time comes he may need your help to fight his way back to us.
0,88,4,BRATAC,Can you hear me old friend?
0,88,5,TEALC,Kelkek mar sholva.
0,88,5,BRATAC,"But where is your god now, TEALC?"
0,88,5,TEALC,He will come.
0,88,5,ONEILL,"I dont think so buddy. I know weve been over this a few times, but in case you werent listening, I am one hundred percent s-sure..."
0,88,6,ONEILL,Ninety nine percent sure APOPHIS is dead.
0,88,6,TEALC,He has deceived you ONEILL. As I have deceived you all these years in coming to be in the service to the Tauri.
0,88,6,ONEILL,Right.
0,88,6,TEALC,I have never left the service of my Lord APOPHIS and I never will.
0,88,6,ONEILL,"So all that time you were helping us out, saving the world, killing Goaulds..."
0,88,6,TEALC,Subterfuge.
0,88,6,ONEILL,Savvy.
0,88,6,TEALC,"You can take my life but you can never take away my loyalty to my god. I die in his name. I die for you, My Lord!"
0,88,7,BRATAC,Enough! Do you know me TEALC?
0,88,7,TEALC,You are the sholva BRATAC.
0,88,7,BRATAC,There was a time I was once the First Prime and loyal servant to your lord APOPHIS. You were my apprentice.
0,88,7,TEALC,Kelkak sholva!
0,88,7,BRATAC,Remember. Remember TEALC!
0,88,8,TEALC,It was glorious.
0,88,8,BRATAC,"For years we fought side by side in battle, in his name."
0,88,8,TEALC,My Lord APOPHIS.
0,88,9,BRATAC,My Lord APOPHIS. Your enemy is defeated. You have won the day.
0,88,9,APOPHIS,Shalmet BRATAC. Rise.
0,88,10,APOPHIS,You have done well and will know my gratitude.
0,88,10,BRATAC,You do me honour.
0,88,11,BRATAC,"In displaying great skill and cunning, these three most honoured your name in battle."
0,88,12,APOPHIS,Tell me of this one.
0,88,12,BRATAC,"His name is TEALC, Mr Lord. My apprentice and with your blessing, my successor."
0,88,12,APOPHIS,Who was your father?
0,88,12,BRATAC,He is the son of...
0,88,12,APOPHIS,Let him speak. If he is to take your place as my First Prime I must know he has a tongue.
0,88,12,TEALC,"My father was RONAK, First Prime of KRONOS, who was murdered for failing to win an unwinable battle. My family was exiled to Chulak."
0,88,12,APOPHIS,He failed his god.
0,88,12,TEALC,He did not.
0,88,12,BRATAC,Sikree TEALC!
0,88,12,TEALC,"My lord, I speak only the truth. The battle could not have been won."
0,88,12,APOPHIS,Your father should have died trying. He was a coward.
0,88,13,TEALC,"My lord, my father was not."
0,88,15,DANIEL,"Uh, what was that?"
0,88,15,BRATAC,A conjured memory. The first of many.
0,88,15,FRASIER,Hes obviously in a lot of pain. At least let me give him...
0,88,15,BRATAC,Pain is what we seek. TEALCS path was laid down with suffering. It is the path he must take to return to us.
0,88,15,FRASIER,"At the moment, hes unconscious."
0,88,15,BRATAC,All the better.
0,88,15,ONEILL,All the better?
0,88,15,BRATAC,"It is his unconscious mind we must reach. I know my ways are foreign to you, but I have known TEALC longer than any of you have lived. I have walked his path. You cannot hope to understand the darkness in his heart as I do. Trust in me. All of you."
0,88,15,CARTER,We do.
0,88,15,DANIEL,What ever you need.
0,88,15,BRATAC,"For the moment, I must meditate in Kelnoreem. This rite will take most of the night and I am tired from my long journey here. In the meantime stay with him, speak to him."
0,88,15,FRASIER,He wont be able to hear us unless...
0,88,15,BRATAC,"Perhaps not in his mind. But in his heart. Even in silence he will know of your presence, but your words will force him to remember. Challenge him when he does, question his beliefs. Without his symbiote he will not resist reason so readily."
0,88,15,ONEILL,
0,88,15,CARTER,Yes Sir.
0,88,17,CARTER,I hope you understand how difficult it is for us to just stand by while TEALC is in such obvious agony. Especially Dr FRASIER.
0,88,17,BRATAC,Humans concern themselves too much with pain.
0,88,17,CARTER,"Yeah, we also dont approve of torture."
0,88,17,BRATAC,"The greater torture would be to leave him as he is. TEALC is strong, stronger than I."
0,88,17,CARTER,"Oh I dont, youre the fittest hundred and thirty year old I know."
0,88,17,BRATAC,"Perhaps, but I am nearing the end of my time. Kelnoreem is more and more difficult. The symbiote I carry within, will mature within two years. It will be my last."
0,88,17,CARTER,Why?
0,88,17,BRATAC,"Even if I could procure another, the new symbiote would reject me. It is how old warriors die."
0,88,17,CARTER,Well maybe we can find someway to help you.
0,88,17,BRATAC,Life for the sake of life means nothing. Neither for me nor for TEALC. Do you understand?
0,88,17,CARTER,I think I do.
0,88,17,BRATAC,"Either he will return to us as we know him, or he will not return."
0,88,18,ONEILL,You wanna go first?
0,88,18,DANIEL,Sure.
0,88,19,ONEILL,Ill go.
0,88,19,DANIEL,Yep.
0,88,20,ONEILL,"So, explain this to me one more time. You honestly believe that from the moment you broke us out of that prison on Chulak, that youve been serving APOPHIS? Because, I gotta tell you, as your best friend at least in this whole live world, that makes absolutely no sense at all. I mean, that would make you the most ineffective double agent in the history of double agenting."
0,88,21,ONEILL,What?
0,88,23,VALAR,
0,88,23,TEALC,I met him. I spoke to him.
0,88,23,VALAR,With APOPHIS himself? You were granted an audience?
0,88,23,TEALC,As a reward for my deeds in battle.
0,88,23,VALAR,"I dont understand, how did he reward you? When they brought you here, you were so weak."
0,88,23,TEALC,He punished me.
0,88,23,VALAR,Then you must have failed him in some way.
0,88,23,TEALC,This day I struck down one hundred of APOPHIS enemies.
0,88,23,VALAR,"You fought well TEALC, none would deny that. But he is a god and if you fail him, by sparing even one enemys life that was yours for the taking, he will know."
0,88,23,TEALC,This was not for the battle. What god would punish a son for loving his father?
0,88,23,VALAR,Your god.
0,88,23,TEALC,Yes but...
0,88,23,VALAR,Never question that again!
0,88,23,JAFFA,Quiet!
0,88,23,VALAR,Today you served APOPHIS well in battle. Serve him well again tomorrow and you may live to see another day.
0,88,24,ONEILL,
0,88,24,DANIEL,I thought he said velour.
0,88,24,ONEILL,Velour?
0,88,24,DANIEL,Velour.
0,88,24,ONEILL,The fabric?
0,88,24,DANIEL,Thats what I heard him say.
0,88,24,ONEILL,Why would he say that?
0,88,24,DANIEL,"I dont know, why would he say VALAR?"
0,88,24,ONEILL,I dont know.
0,88,24,TEALC,
0,88,24,DANIEL,What?
0,88,24,TEALC.,
0,88,25,TEALC,
0,88,25,ONEILL,"Well, you were sort of...trying to kill everyone these past few weeks."
0,88,25,TEALC,I could never have harmed you. The Rite of Malsuraan has been successfully. Please release me.
0,88,25,ONEILL,"Nice try, but...no."
0,88,25,TEALC,I am not your enemy. We are brothers. DANIEL Jackson...
0,88,25,DANIEL,Tell us about VALAR.
0,88,25,TEALC,"I have not heard that name in years. I trained with him under BRATAC. We served in the personal guard of APOPHIS. If you do not return my symbiote to me, I will die."
0,88,25,DANIEL,What happened to him?
0,88,26,TEALC,He failed his god.
0,88,26,ONEILL,"His god? You mean that scum-sucking, over-dressed, boom-box voiced snake in the head? Latest on our long list of dead, bad guys?"
0,88,26,FRASIER,"Colonel, his heart rate just doubled."
0,88,27,TEALC,Kashak!
0,88,27,ONEILL,That I understand.
0,88,27,TEALC,You think I dont know what youre doing to me.
0,88,27,DANIEL,We hope you do.
0,88,27,TEALC,No Jaffa can survive the Rite of Malsuraan. You are allowing BRATAC to kill me! Where is he?! Sholva! Where are you?!
0,88,27,FRASIER,
0,88,27,TEALC,Where are you sholva?! Are you afraid to face me?!
0,88,28,TEALC,Where are you? Where are you? Kelpak!
0,88,29,BRATAC,"Were I truly your enemy, you would be dead."
0,88,30,TEALC,"This is pointless, I am not blind."
0,88,30,TEALC,Once again.
0,88,30,BRATAC,You have died enough for one day. You begin again in the morning.
0,88,31,TEALC,Without this.
0,88,31,BRATAC,Do you believe you can defeat the First Prime of APOPHIS in a joust?
0,88,31,TEALC,I am the stronger.
0,88,34,BRATAC,Shall I fire and stop this waste of time? Or will you learn?
0,88,34,TEALC,I was not prepared.
0,88,34,BRATAC,"There are no second chances in battle. You have ears to hear and eyes to see, but you will not learn! Shall I put us both out of our misery?"
0,88,35,BRATAC,The choice is mine. Who can stop me?
0,88,35,TEALC,Yes.
0,88,35,BRATAC,So you believe our Lord APOPHIS is all seeing? All powerful?
0,88,35,TEALC,He is a god.
0,88,35,BRATAC,"Is he? In battle TEALC, faith will not save you. Blind faith least of all. Rely on your own strength, your own wits, or you are of no use to me."
0,88,37,DANIEL,"I think the point that Jack was trying to make is that youre generally a very, extremely logical person and therefore your assertion that you never left the service of APOPHIS is so completely illogical, almost to the point of making absolutely no sense whatsoever..."
0,88,37,TEALC,"Do you not know the meaning of faith, DANIEL Jackson?"
0,88,37,DANIEL,I think I do.
0,88,37,TEALC,Then you should know that my faith in APOPHIS is beyond question.
0,88,37,DANIEL,"Still, if you remember me and you remember Jack, you must remember at some point questioning your faith."
0,88,37,TEALC,Never! APOPHIS is a god.
0,88,37,DANIEL,"False god. Dead, false god."
0,88,37,TEALC,Your words cannot change the truth.
0,88,37,DANIEL,"Theyre not my words, TEALC, theyre yours. Of course, you were wrong at the time because he wasnt...actually dead. But thats neither here not there..."
0,88,37,TEALC,Lies!
0,88,37,DANIEL,"The point is, there was a time in your life when you realised the Goauld cant all be gods. Every symbiote a Jaffa carries will take a human host given the chance and become a Goauld. How can they all be gods?"
0,88,37,TEALC,Do not test my temper woman!
0,88,39,DREYAUC,I know you honour BRATAC.
0,88,39,TEALC,I said do not test my temper!
0,88,40,DREYAUC,But you have no choice but to tell APOPHIS of his betrayal.
0,88,40,TEALC,
0,88,40,DREYAUC,
0,88,40,TEALC,"If I am ever to be First Prime of APOPHIS, I must first honour BRATAC."
0,88,40,DREYAUC,"You have seen the power of APOPHIS. You have seen his chariots rise from the ground, walk through the wall of water within the Chappai."
0,88,40,TEALC,As I have done.
0,88,40,DREYAUC,Explain how a ball of light can leave his palm and throw a warrior across the square if he is not a god.
0,88,40,TEALC,I cannot! Yet neither have I seen a warrior greater than BRATAC.
0,88,40,DREYAUC,Then you are the servant of two masters.
0,88,40,TEALC,"What am I to do, DREYAUC?"
0,88,41,DREYAUC,Come to bed.
0,88,42,DANIEL,Woman? Did he just call me a woman?
0,88,42,ONEILL,"Yes, I believe he did."
0,88,43,CARTER,Still unconscious.
0,88,43,DANIEL,"In and out, obviously delirious."
0,88,44,CARTER,Hows Junior doing?
0,88,44,FRASIER,"The symbiote is fine for now, although I dont know what were gonna do with it if we let TEALC die. But, it wont be my problem. Ill have already resigned if we let this go that far."
0,88,44,CARTER,"Janet, I know how you feel..."
0,88,44,FRASIER,"No. Im a doctor, Sam. This goes against every part of me to just stand by and do nothing."
0,88,44,CARTER,I dont think that were doing nothing.
0,88,44,FRASIER,Yeah.
0,88,45,CARTER,"So, is it working? Has he said anything?"
0,88,45,ONEILL,"Talked about fabric, briefly."
0,88,45,DANIEL,He just called me a woman.
0,88,45,ONEILL,So I think its working.
0,88,45,DANIEL,"Well, somethings happening."
0,88,45,CARTER,"Well, it looks like were in for the whole night. We should probably take turns sitting with him."
0,88,45,ONEILL,"Yeah, alright. Ill come back in a couple of hours. DANIEL, you go after me. Then I think well all wanna be here."
0,88,46,CARTER,"Hey TEALC. Look, I dont know how good Im gonna be at this, but um...I guess the important thing is just to be there for you."
0,88,47,TEALC,Major CARTER. How can you allow them to do this to me?
0,88,47,TEALC...,
0,88,47,TEALC,"I have no wish to die, Major CARTER. You and Dr FRASIER could yet save me."
0,88,47,CARTER,Youre not gonna die.
0,88,47,TEALC,I am being murdered as we speak.
0,88,47,CARTER,Were helping you.
0,88,47,TEALC,Help me escape. Please.
0,88,47,CARTER,"Oh God. TEALC, we want you to remember."
0,88,47,TEALC,"Do you believe in a god, Major CARTER?"
0,88,47,CARTER,This isnt about me.
0,88,47,TEALC,How would it be if you were punished for loving your god as I love mine?
0,88,47,CARTER,Its not the same.
0,88,47,TEALC,I cant but help what I believe.
0,88,47,CARTER,"You believe in freedom, TEALC. You believe in justice, in protecting people from false gods. You despise everything APOPHIS was."
0,88,47,TEALC,He failed his god...he...failed...his god...
0,88,47,TEALC?,
0,88,49,TEALC!,
0,88,49,TEALC,Why have you returned from the planet?
0,88,49,VALAR,I need to speak with you.
0,88,49,TEALC,"Speak now, APOPHIS has summoned me."
0,88,49,VALAR,Alone. Please.
0,88,50,VALAR,The battle did not go well. RA'S warriors were in far greater numbers than we believed.
0,88,50,TEALC,You were given a battalion.
0,88,50,VALAR,
0,88,50,TEALC,Shankrevlar.
0,88,50,VALAR,It was the only way to save my men.
0,88,50,TEALC,And yourself.
0,88,50,VALAR,"No! I intend to return and with greater numbers I will drive RA'S warriors from their foothold. Please, tell him I am no coward and if given the chance I will yet prevail. I swear it."
0,88,50,TEALC,Go to our sleeping quarters. Wait for me there.
0,88,50,VALAR,
0,88,50,TEALC,You may yet wish you had.
0,88,52,BRATAC,"My Lord, we are at your service."
0,88,52,APOPHIS,Who did you entrust with this campaign?
0,88,52,BRATAC,
0,88,52,APOPHIS,Yet he returned in disgrace.
0,88,52,TEALC,"Perhaps not in disgrace, my Lord. But as part of a cunning strategy. To withdraw, only to return in greater numbers to crush an overconfident enemy. VALAR himself would like to lead the second wave."
0,88,52,APOPHIS,Does he?
0,88,52,BRATAC,"My Lord, allow me to..."
0,88,53,APOPHIS,"You would have done the same in his place, would you TEALC?"
0,88,53,TEALC,No my Lord.
0,88,53,APOPHIS,You would have held your ground in the name of your god?
0,88,53,TEALC,"Yes, my Lord."
0,88,53,APOPHIS,"Then return with him to his place of shame, and kill him."
0,88,53,TEALC,"Yes, my Lord."
0,88,57,TEALC,"Jaffa! Kekshal kree, sholva."
0,88,59,VALAR,"You may take solace for what you are about to do, TEALC. I should have died on this battlefield."
0,88,60,VALAR,"Please tell APOPHIS I died well, honouring his name."
0,88,61,TEALC,Rise.
0,88,63,TEALC,"There is a small village, two or three days walk south of the city. You may find shelter. Do not allow yourself to be captured by either side."
0,88,63,VALAR,
0,88,63,TEALC,We shall see.
0,88,63,VALAR,"I am more willing to face my punishment than to live knowing what APOPHIS would do to you. For your sake, you must."
0,88,63,TEALC,Go now and never show your face again.
0,88,63,VALAR,"He is a god, TEALC, he will know that you have spared me."
0,88,63,TEALC,We shall see. Go.
0,88,66,TEALC,It is done.
0,88,67,APOPHIS,You have promise TEALC.
0,88,71,HAMMOND,You didnt stay away long.
0,88,71,ONEILL,You should talk. You can go in there you know.
0,88,71,HAMMOND,I know.
0,88,71,ONEILL,"General, if TEALC were here, hed say you made the right decision."
0,88,71,HAMMOND,If he were here.
0,88,71,ONEILL,Hell be back.
0,88,71,HAMMOND,"If not, TEALC will be sent to a high security facility and placed in solitary confinement. When his symbiote matures in four or fives years... I wont do that to him Jack."
0,88,71,ONEILL,No Sir. Of course not.
0,88,72,DREYAUC,"What is wrong, TEALC?"
0,88,72,TEALC,"Three days ago I led a battalion, to retake a planet that had been occupied by RA'S army. APOPHIS ordered me to burn a village of RA'S followers to the ground."
0,88,72,DREYAUC,You did this?
0,88,72,TEALC,Yes.
0,88,72,DREYAUC,Then sleep well in the knowledge you have served APOPHIS.
0,88,72,TEALC,"I cannot close my eyes without seeing the innocent faces of the women and children who lived there. A Jaffa lived there also, a warrior named VALAR."
0,88,72,DREYAUC,No.
0,88,72,TEALC,"I banished him to that village to save his life, only to take it away for fear that APOPHIS would learn my secret. I put my own life before that of an entire village and that of a dear friend."
0,88,72,DREYAUC,"No, you had no choice."
0,88,72,TEALC,I did have a choice.
0,88,73,DREYAUC,"A son...will soon be born to us TEALC. You must ensure that he has a father. Our son will be born into a real home, a gift from APOPHIS himself. It is the best life we can hope for."
0,88,73,TEALC,Then why am I so ashamed?
0,88,76,TEALC,Tematey! Master BRATAC. Tema tey.
0,88,76,BRATAC,
0,88,76,TEALC,You are not pleased.
0,88,76,BRATAC,No.
0,88,76,TEALC,There is no greater honour among Jaffa than to become First Prime to ones god...
0,88,76,BRATAC,"Ahh! You know as well as I what the Goauld truly are. We pretend, men like you and I, so we may advance in rank and privilege, but do not pretend to me now. You know the truth. Can you look me in the face and say otherwise?"
0,88,76,TEALC,My entire life you have prepared me for this day. Why?
0,88,76,BRATAC,I saw the spark of doubt in you and the wisdom to keep that doubt unto yourself. I saw you play the game with those who would play god.
0,88,76,TEALC,"If I do not believe in him, how can I serve?"
0,88,76,BRATAC,Because there is no other choice but to serve. The Goauld are powerful. Theyve seen to it that we cannot live without them and so it may be for all time. But neither can they live without the Jaffa. We are theyre true power.
0,88,76,TEALC,I do not understand.
0,88,76,BRATAC,"As First Prime that power will be yours. When APOPHIS throws his armies into the fire you will be there to temper his sword. And in so doing, you may save countless lives as I have done in my time."
0,88,76,TEALC,And you have done all these things against his will?
0,88,76,BRATAC,"His will can be made to bend, but not always. I have done deeds for which I cannot forgive even myself. As will you. Men such as you and I have only the comfort of those time we make a difference. Make a difference."
0,88,79,TEALC,There.
0,88,79,BRATAC,Those are the humans who came through the Chappai. They do not appear to be as formidable as I have imagined.
0,88,79,TEALC,Their weapons are not of Goauld design.
0,88,79,BRATAC,"That may be so, TEALC, but they are only three."
0,88,79,TEALC,There is something more. A strength. They know the taste of freedom.
0,88,79,BRATAC,"Your dreams of freedom will be your undoing, TEALC."
0,88,79,TEALC,Perhaps so.
0,88,79,BRATAC,Pray they are not chosen as hosts. That is the best fate you can wish for them.
0,88,81,TEALC,What have I done?
0,88,82,FRASIER,"Hes in de-fib, get the cart."
0,88,82,CARTER,This is it.
0,88,83,ONEILL,Get BRATAC down here.
0,88,85,FRASIER,Im returning the symbiote.
0,88,85,BRATAC,Stand aside.
0,88,85,FRASIER,If I dont return it immediately...
0,88,85,BRATAC,"Stand aside, or his suffering will be for nothing. This is the moment when he must choose."
0,88,85,HAMMOND,"Stand aside, Dr FRASIER."
0,88,87,BRATAC,"Choose now, TEALC. Return to those who love freedom, or die in the name of a false god. Choose!"
0,88,88,TEALC,"Kree homel, Goauld!"
0,88,89,BRATAC,Choose to be the warrior we know! Renounce APOPHIS and return to us!
0,88,89,FRASIER,Its now or never.
0,88,89,BRATAC,Choose!
0,88,90,BRATAC,Very well.
0,88,91,FRASIER,Lets move.
0,88,91,APOPHIS,Kill the rest.
0,88,93,FRASIER,Symbiotes in.
0,88,94,NURSE,No change.
0,88,94,FRASIER,We waited too long. Charge to two hundred.
0,88,94,NURSE,Charging.
0,88,95,FRASIER,Clear.
0,88,98,NURSE,No pulse.
0,88,98,FRASIER,Make it three sixty. Give me five of eppy. Charging. Clear.
0,88,99,ONEILL,I can save these people!
0,88,100,ONEILL,Help me. Help me.
0,88,100,TEALC,Many have said that.
0,88,101,TEALC,But you are the first I believe could do it.
0,88,103,TEALC,I choose freedom.
0,88,105,BRATAC,The right has succeeded. He has returned to us.
0,88,105,ONEILL,"Uh, just out of curiosity...how do you feel about...?"
0,88,105,TEALC,
0,88,106,ONEILL,Its good enough for me. Get him out of those restraints.
0,88,107,HAMMOND,"Thank you doctor, well done."
0,88,107,FRASIER,Yes Sir. Im glad it worked out too.
0,88,107,CARTER,Hey TEALC.
0,88,107,TEALC,"Major CARTER, DANIEL Jackson. Tematey."
0,88,107,BRATAC,My friend.
0,88,107,TEALC,"General HAMMOND, I once again pledge my allegiance to you and the people of this world. And I request permission to return to SG1."
0,88,107,HAMMOND,Permission granted.
