0,90,0,"""THE FIFTH MAN""",By Joseph Mallozzi & Paul Mullie We begin with a firefight on a foreign planet between SG-1 and a whole bunch of Jaffa. Sam and Teal'C are shown dodging staff blasts.
0,90,0,SAM,"We're gonna make it to the gate, but we're under fire! Teal'C's taken a hit."
0,90,1,SAM,What's your situation?
0,90,1,JACK,"Tyler's hit too, and we're cut off ... get the hell outta here!"
0,90,1,SAM,We can hold the gate!!!
0,90,1,JACK,Negative.
0,90,1,SAM,We're NOT leaving without you!
0,90,1,JACK,Carter! Don't argue with me! Get reenforcements!
0,90,1,DAVIS,"Sir, we're getting a signal ... it's"
0,90,1,HAMMOND,Open the iris.
0,90,2,SAM,Close the iris!
0,90,2,HAMMOND,"Report, Major."
0,90,2,SAM,We were attacked by several Jaffa ... Lt. Tyler went down watching out six ... Colonel O'Neill went back for him.
0,90,2,TEAL'C,Let's assemble a rescue team and go back for them immediately!
0,90,2,HAMMOND,Hold on ... who's Lt. Tyler?
0,90,2,DANNY,"What do you mean, ""Who's Lt. Tyler?"" ... he's a member of SG-1."
0,90,2,HAMMOND,What?
0,90,2,DANNY,"You assigned him yourself last month, Sir."
0,90,3,SAM,
0,90,3,HAMMOND,"Major, I have NO IDEA what you're talking about!"
0,90,4,JACK,"We gotta move, Lt. Can you walk?"
0,90,4,TYLER,I'll try.
0,90,4,JACK,
0,90,4,TEAL'C,"GeneralHammond, we must return to the planet immediately!"
0,90,4,HAMMOND,No one's going ANYWHERE until I find out exactly what happened.
0,90,4,SAM,"Colonel O'Neill and Lt. Tyler were cut off from the gate. I already told you, Sir."
0,90,4,HAMMOND,And I'm telling YOU I've never heard of Lt. Tyler!
0,90,4,DANNY,How can you SAY that?!
0,90,4,HAMMOND,I think you should report to the infirmary.
0,90,4,SAM,"Sir, there is nothing wrong with us!"
0,90,4,HAMMOND,We'll leave that up to Doctor Frasier.
0,90,4,DANNY,"General, Jack is trapped on that planet."
0,90,4,HAMMOND,Sergent? Escort them to the infirmery.
0,90,4,SAM,"With or without reinforcements, we ARE going back, Sir."
0,90,4,HAMMOND,"The HELL you are! Relinquage your weapons! AIRMEN! Major Carter, I WILL authorize the use of force unless you relinquage those weapons immediately!"
0,90,5,JACK,Thought you could walk.
0,90,5,TYLER,"Sorry, Sir."
0,90,5,JACK,"Oh, it's no problem. How's the leg?"
0,90,5,TYLER,It's no problem.
0,90,5,JACK,"Yeah, right!"
0,90,5,TYLER,What is this place?
0,90,5,JACK,"I wouldn't buy a time-share, but it's ... defendable."
0,90,5,TYLER,Until Major Carter returns?
0,90,5,JACK,"Yeah, Major Carter and a whole bunch of her friends."
0,90,5,TYLER,"Colonel, you could have made it to the gate ... you came back for me."
0,90,5,JACK,What's your point?
0,90,5,TYLER,I guess I'm grateful.
0,90,5,JACK,"Well, I wasn't gonna let you DIE, Lt. ... it's like ... A TON of paperwork."
0,90,5,TYLER,Paperwork?
0,90,5,JACK,It's a joke. It's my way of deflecting attention from my obvious heroism. You'll get used to it.
0,90,5,TYLER,All right. I understand.
0,90,5,JACK,All right.
0,90,6,JANET,"General Hammond? Teal'C is going to be fine. It's a bad burn, but his symbiote should take care of it. Any word from Colonel O'Neill?"
0,90,6,HAMMOND,we've been trying to raise him using the MALP as a relay ... apparently it's been disabled.
0,90,6,JANET,"Well, I've completed my preliminary exams of Major Carter, Teal'C, and Daniel, and so far, I've found nothing wrong with them. I mean they're obviously agitated, but that's understandable, given the circumstances ..."
0,90,6,HAMMOND,"... Doctor, 3 of my people just come back from a mission talking about a Lt. who doesn't exist ... you can't tell me there's nothing wrong with them"
0,90,6,JANET,"I can't explain it, Sir."
0,90,6,HAMMOND,Some kind of hiluscination?
0,90,6,JANET,Hiluscinations aren't usually shared.
0,90,6,HAMMOND,There's never been a Tyler in this command.
0,90,6,JANET,"Yes, Sir ... and we're still waiting for test results."
0,90,6,HAMMOND,"In the meantime, I want them quarentined in the imfermary."
0,90,6,JANET,"All ready done that, Sir as a precaution. But, they DID insist I ask what you're gonna do about Colonel O'Neill."
0,90,6,HAMMOND,"If SG-1 has falled under the control of some kind of Alien influence, anyone I send back to the planet will be compromised as well. Until we know EXACTLY what's going on, P7S-441 is off limits."
0,90,6,JANET,"Yes, Sir."
0,90,6,SAM,This is rediculous! We never should have left that DAMN planet!
0,90,6,TEAL'C,You were ordered to do so by Colonel O'Neill ...
0,90,6,SAM,... Who could be DEAD by now for all we know!
0,90,6,DANNY,There's not like there's anything we could do about that right now ... there's several heavilly armed men right outside that door.
0,90,6,SAM,"Well, we need to do something."
0,90,6,DANNY,
0,90,6,SAM,I don't think he's just saying it ... I think he REALLY doesn't remember him.
0,90,6,DANNY,"Well, how could that be? Yesterday, we were all in the briefing room for TWO HOURS going over the mission."
0,90,6,TEAL'C,I do not believe GeneralHammond would lie to us.
0,90,6,DANNY,"So, what? Is he suffering from some sort of amnesia, or ... ?"
0,90,6,SAM,"Well, if that's the case, they're all suffering from it. I mean, Doctor Frasier doesn't seem to remember him either."
0,90,6,TEAL'C,Perhaps GeneralHammond is correct ... perhaps there is something wrong with us.
0,90,6,DANNY,
0,90,6,SAM,Because the Daniel Jackson in THAT reality never joined the SGC.
0,90,6,DANNY,"Right. So, what if this is a reality where Tyler never joined? Or ... maybe he was killed in a relishion ... maybe he was never even born."
0,90,6,SAM,"I don't know, Daniel. I mean, there was NOTHING on 441 that even remotely resembled a quantum mirror."
0,90,6,TEAL'C,Perhaps the stargate malfunctioned.
0,90,6,SAM,"Well, we've never had any evidence to suggest the gate can access a parralelle universe."
0,90,6,TEAL'C,"If Lt. Tyler does exist in this reality, there would be a record of him in the base computer."
0,90,6,SAM,"Yes. Yes, the personelle files. My access code isn't working. They must have decided that we're a security risk, and locked us out."
0,90,6,DANNY,"So, you can't get in?"
0,90,6,SAM,I didn't say THAT!
0,90,7,JACK,"Where's your weapon, Lt.?"
0,90,7,TYLER,"Sorry, Sir. I dropped it when I got hit."
0,90,7,JACK,"All right. Well, we've still got 4 mags, 2 clips , a little C- 4, some grenades, and a launcher."
0,90,7,TYLER,Is that enough?
0,90,7,JACK,"Well, it's a start."
0,90,7,SAM,There's no record of a Lt. Tyler on active duty at the SGC.
0,90,7,DANNY,That's impossible.
0,90,7,SAM,"Even day pass visitors are logged in ... there's NO WAY he could have been on the base, and not in the computer. I configured a search for the name Tyler anywhere in the database ... nothing."
0,90,7,DANNY,"Well, obviously, someone is wrong here ... could it be us?"
0,90,7,SAM,I think we have to admit the posibility.
0,90,7,TEAL'C,"In either case, O'Neill remains in danger."
0,90,7,SAM,Wait a minute. This is weird ... somebody else did an identical search less than an hour ago. Somebody outside the base.
0,90,7,DANNY,Someone OUTSIDE the base ... how do you know that?
0,90,7,SAM,"Because it's not a base ID ... it's a user number ... 4574. Wow! He's been busy! Over the past 2 weeks, he's accessed a number of secure files. Mission logs, briefing, personnel files"
0,90,7,DANNY,Uh ... WHO'S personelle files?
0,90,7,SAM,*Sighs* Ours.
0,90,8,JACK,"All right. Listen up ... we've got a couple MRE's left, but we're running low on water. I'm gonna check the area. Take the P-90."
0,90,8,TYLER,
0,90,8,JACK,"Well, the truth is, they should have been here by now. Something must have happened."
0,90,8,TYLER,Are you saying they're not coming for us?
0,90,8,JACK,Nope. I'm just saying it might take a little longer than we thought.
0,90,8,TYLER,What if they never made it back?
0,90,8,JACK,Then General Hammond'll send somebody else.
0,90,8,TYLER,"Well, how do you"
0,90,8,JACK,"Because, Lt. We don't leave our people behind. You should know that."
0,90,8,TYLER,"Yes, Sir."
0,90,8,JACK,"Good. Stay off the radio. Keep the channel open. I'll give you 3 clicks when I'm on my way back ... So, don't shoot me."
0,90,8,TYLER,I won't.
0,90,9,HAMMOND,Sergent.
0,90,9,DAVIS,"I'm sorry, Sir. The second MALP was hit by ZAT fire shortly after reaching the planet."
0,90,9,HAMMOND,Launch the UAV.
0,90,9,DAVIS,"Yes, Sir."
0,90,9,INTERCOM,Initiate.
0,90,9,DAVIS,
0,90,11,DAVIS,
0,90,11,JACK,We're still here. OVER!
0,90,12,HAMMOND,This is General Hammond. What's your situation?
0,90,12,JACK,"We need some backup, Sir. Tyler's immoble, and there's Jaffa all over the place!"
0,90,12,DAVIS,"Sir, we lost the signal."
0,90,12,HAMMOND,"He said ""Tyler."" Obviously, he's been affected by the same hilusination as the rest of SG-1. We can not send a retrieval team until we know more."
0,90,12,DAVIS,"Well, Sir. If you like, we can try to send a second UAV."
0,90,12,SIMMONS,"I don't know if that's such a good idea, General. Those things aren't cheap."
0,90,12,HAMMOND,Colonel Simmons!
0,90,12,SIMMONS,You might wanna take a look at that.
0,90,12,HAMMOND,"My office. Colonel, I understand you've been ordered to investigate a security problem."
0,90,12,SIMMONS,"Well, Sir, when 3 members of your best team starts voicing concerns about their imaginary friend, it does tend to raise a few eyebrows. Your own report suggests there may be some sort of mind control."
0,90,12,HAMMOND,I have people working on it.
0,90,12,SIMMONS,"I'm sure you do, but we believe a ... independant investigation is called for. I'm sure we'll have you ... full cooperation. You can use the red phone if you'd like, Sir. But one day, you're gonna play that card once too often."
0,90,12,HAMMOND,"Colonel, I have an officer trapped off-world, and there's nothing I can do for him until I get to the BOTTOM of this."
0,90,12,SIMMONS,"Well, then, Sir. You should welcome my help."
0,90,13,SIMMONS,"Ah, Doctor Jackson. Sit down."
0,90,13,DANNY,Why?
0,90,13,SIMMONS,"Well, I thought I'd give you an opportunity to explain what happened on that planet."
0,90,13,DANNY,I ... filed a report.
0,90,13,SIMMONS,") Yes, you did. And a very interesting read it is. Full of amazing events and ... fictional characters. Sit down."
0,90,14,JANET,Wait a minute ... let me see that.
0,90,14,NURSE,Doctor Frasier? We got the blood work and DNA results. No anomalies detected.
0,90,14,JANET,"Thank you. I found this residue on Teal'C's jacket, we should have this analized."
0,90,14,NURSE,"Yes, Doctor."
0,90,16,SIMMONS,"This is a videotape of your briefing before the mission to P7S-441... I see 4 members of the SG-1 team, I see Doctor Frasier, I see General Hammond ... but I don't see any Lt's."
0,90,16,DANNY,This could be any briefing.
0,90,16,SIMMONS,Take a look at the time code.
0,90,16,DANNY,*Sighs* This is a waste of time!
0,90,16,SIMMONS,This is not a waste of time. This is an official investigation.
0,90,16,DANNY,"Oh, well, yeah, I get it. We obviously have Lt. Tyler issues ... I mean I say he exists ... you say he doesn't."
0,90,16,SIMMONS,This is not JUST about Lt. Tyler.
0,90,16,DANNY,Someone else doesn't exist?
0,90,16,SIMMONS,I'd like you to explain your relationship with Doctor Sarah Gardner.
0,90,17,DANNY,What does THAT have to do with THIS?
0,90,17,SIMMONS,Doctor Jackson. I am here to investigate potential Alien influences over members of Stargate Command. The fact that a Goa'Uld has taken your ex-girlfriend as a host has everything to do with this.
0,90,17,SIMMONS,You were very close at one time?
0,90,17,DANNY,That's none of your business!
0,90,17,SIMMONS,Your entire LIFE is our business!
0,90,17,DANNY,"You know ... do I need to call an attorney, or ... ?"
0,90,17,SIMMONS,Serious questions have been raised concerning your viability with this command. I am just giving you an opportunity to RESPOND!
0,90,17,DANNY,"Ok, respond, FINE! I lost someone I care about and not for the first time, I might add. You think that makes me sympathetic to the goa'Uld??!!?!"
0,90,17,SIMMONS,I think that makes you someone who's judgment can be somewhat clouded. And for a man in your position that's ... unacceptable.
0,90,17,DANNY,"What's YOUR position, again?"
0,90,18,JANET,I need to speak to Major Carter. Thank you.
0,90,18,SAM,"What's going on, Janet?"
0,90,18,JANET,I need to ask you something. This Lt. Tyler you keep talking about ... what does he look like?
0,90,18,SAM,"African-American, Mid 20's."
0,90,18,JANET,"About 5'10"", 5'11""? I'm not sure, but I think I remember him."
0,90,18,SAM,"2 hours ago, you said you'd never heard of him."
0,90,18,JANET,"I know. I ... I can't explain it, but I can remember his face!"
0,90,18,SAM,Does anyone else remember him?
0,90,18,JANET,I don't know.
0,90,18,SAM,
0,90,18,JANET,I have to report this to General Hammond.
0,90,18,SAM,"Janet, wait! I ... if you come forward now, they'll start suspecting you as well. You need to find evidence."
0,90,18,JANET,Sam ...
0,90,18,SAM,"... as long as we're locked up in here, we can't do ANYTHING to help Colonel O'Neill. It's up to you."
0,90,18,HAMMOND,"I would like to speak to Senator Keesley ... I'd like to know who this man is working for . I appreciate that, Sir. I ... need ... to ... know ... Mr. Secretary, I wouldn't be MAKING this call if I didn't consider it a matter of the utmost importance. Yes, I know he's in a meeting with the Joint Chiefs ... do you have ANY idea when he'll become available? I see ... All right ... thank you."
0,90,18,JACK,"Where ya from, Tyler?"
0,90,18,TYLER,Texas? Mostly ... we moved around alot. You?
0,90,18,JACK,Born in Chicago. Raised in Minnesota.
0,90,18,TYLER,Is it nice there?
0,90,18,JACK,"""Is it NICE there""?! You know what the Goa'Uld REALLY want from us? Minnesota, that's what. For the fishing, mostly. I'll take you sometime."
0,90,18,TYLER,Fishing
0,90,18,JACK,"Well, yeah. Ask Teal'C ... he can't get enough."
0,90,18,TYLER,"When do you think we'll get outta here, Sir?"
0,90,18,JACK,"Well, if not tomorrow, we'll head up into the hills and wait until the Jaffa loose interest."
0,90,18,TYLER,They'll never stop hunting us.
0,90,18,JACK,What makes you say that?
0,90,18,TYLER,Isn't ... that the way they are?
0,90,18,JACK,"That MAY BE the way they are. They're the way ... we are, so ... there you are. Get some sleep."
0,90,19,SIMMONS,"Tell me, Teal'C. How does it feel knowing you betrayed your friends?"
0,90,19,TEAL'C,I betrayed no one.
0,90,19,SIMMONS,"You led Apophis into the Mother Ship, which was occupied by SG-1 and the Tok'Ra Sel'Mack. You could have gotten them all killed."
0,90,19,TEAL'C,At the time I was led to believe that my time with the Tau'Ri was a subterfuge.
0,90,19,SIMMONS,And now?
0,90,19,TEAL'C,I am loyal to the Tau'Ri.
0,90,19,SIMMONS,Why should I believe you?
0,90,19,TEAL'C,"If I was still loyal to the Goa'Uld, you would know it."
0,90,19,SIMMONS,Really?
0,90,19,TEAL'C,It would be immediately apparent as I would not HESITATE to KILL you where you SIT!
0,90,20,JACK,"Oh, crap!"
0,90,20,TYLER,What is it?
0,90,20,JACK,Gliders. Stay here.
0,90,21,TYLER,Nice shot!
0,90,21,JACK,Where the hell did THAT come from?!
0,90,21,TYLER,That's the glider we saw leaving the area when we were checking the crash two transport.
0,90,21,JACK,"Right. Anyway, he's made our position. Can you move?"
0,90,21,TYLER,Not yet.
0,90,21,JACK,All right. Time to begin.
0,90,21,SIMMONS,"We have a problem here, Major. You say this was your third operative with Lt. Tyler. But, based on your own report of SG-1's last report, you make absolutely no mention of his name."
0,90,21,SAM,Daniel's name doesn't appear in all my reports ... doesn't mean he wasn't there.
0,90,21,SIMMONS,Don't you think it's kind of odd that not one other person on this Base can cooberate your story?
0,90,21,SAM,"Yes, I do. But what difference does it make ... Colonel O'Neill is still out there."
0,90,21,SIMMONS,And you want us to send out a rescue team based on your word alone that he hasn't been compromised.
0,90,21,SAM,We'll go ourselves.
0,90,21,SIMMONS,"I'm afraid I can't trust you to do that. You see? Doctor Jackson's motives for being here are colored by his emotions, always have been. Teal'C changes sides more often than I change the oil in my car."
0,90,21,SAM,What about me?
0,90,21,SIMMONS,"Well, let's see ... You were briefly taken over as a host for the Goa'Uld. Once you fell under the control of artificial intelligence of Alien origin ... and the last time we MET, you harboured an Alien in your own HOME. You know, I'm beginning to wonder if this is having some sort of ... residual effect because just yesterday, you violated base security by trying to get into one of the mainframes. I could NAIL YOU on THAT alone!"
0,90,21,SAM,You're user number 4574. The one who's been accessing our personelle files. You don't care about Tyler. You're just waiting for something to use against us! Who are you getting your orders from ... Colonel?
0,90,21,SIMMONS,This interview is OVER!
0,90,22,JACK,"Allright. Trips are set. Take the 9 mil. If we get into it, make every shot count."
0,90,22,TYLER,"I can not let you do this, Colonel."
0,90,22,JACK,Do what?
0,90,22,TYLER,I can not let you die protecting me.
0,90,22,JANET'S LAB.,
0,90,22,HAMMOND,"What have you got for us, Doctor?"
0,90,22,JANET,"Sir, I think I may have figured out what happened to SG-1. I found traces of a foreign chemical on Teal'C's uniform. I've completed my analysis."
0,90,22,HAMMOND,What is it?
0,90,22,JANET,"Well, I'm not 100% sure, but it's chemical structure closely resembles Chordocolocedalcoline, which is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate and process human memory. I believe that Lt. Tyler, or the IDEA of Lt. Tyler is nothing more than a chemical implant. Here, take a look. You see, the effect is greatest here ... in the temporal lobe associated with face-recognition. See, I think it's possible that SG-1 encountered someone on the planet that exposed them to this compound in order to convince them that he, she, or ... it ... was somehow familiar."
0,90,22,HAMMOND,We're not talking about a vague recognition ... we're talking about detailed memories that go back WEEKS before they ever set foot on that planet.
0,90,22,JANET,"Yes, Sir ... and obviously, their own minds provided the details necessary to complete that illusion."
0,90,22,SIMMONS,Didn't your first report say that their MRI's were clean?
0,90,22,JANET,They were. The Chemical disapates fairly quickly.
0,90,22,SIMMONS,"So, what's that?"
0,90,22,JANET,"That ... that's me. I was exposed. The ... chemical passed thru a layer of plastic, which is probrably why I experienced a diminished effect, but ... this is HOW I figured it out!"
0,90,22,SIMMONS,"You were exposed to an Alien chemical, and now you claim to have ""Figured it out""?!"
0,90,22,JANET,"Sir, knowing that the contamination requires close proximity, I am confident that SG-1 could return to the planet, and avoid further contamination."
0,90,22,SIMMONS,You can't trust her.
0,90,22,JANET,"General, please. This could be Colonel O'Neill's last hope."
0,90,22,JACK,I counted 15. Could get interesting.
0,90,22,TYLER,Colonel ... I'm not what you think I am. I'm not a member of your team. I never was. I am not even human! My race is called the R'Yol.
0,90,22,JACK,Take your position.
0,90,22,TYLER,I exposed you to a chemical that made you THINK I was one of your own.
0,90,22,JACK,Whatever ... get back there.
0,90,22,TYLER,You don't believe me. Look at my leg. It's almost healed! Would this be possible if I were human?!
0,90,22,JACK,Get down!
0,90,22,TYLER,I'll show you.
0,90,23,JACK,Jesus. What the hell is that?
0,90,23,TYLER,A glimpse of my true nature. He's turned back human.
0,90,23,JACK,You mean what you really look like?
0,90,23,TYLER,"It's a natural defence mechinism. The chemical we produce in our bodies. That's why I was a prisoner of the Jaffa. They were taking me to be disected and studied. I managed to break free of my cell, and damage the guiding system of the transport ship. We crashed on this planet. That's where you found me. I didn't know if you could be trusted."
0,90,23,JACK,"Well, you picked a hell of a time to tell me."
0,90,23,TYLER,"Please. Understand, Colonel."
0,90,24,JACK,Get the C-4 up. AGAIN!
0,90,25,TYLER,
0,90,26,SAM,"I think we're all clear. You all right, Sir?"
0,90,26,JACK,Fine. Teal'C!
0,90,26,TEAL'C,Lt. Tyler is not who he appears to be.
0,90,26,JACK,I know. He told me. Stand down. Let's go. Why didn't you just ASK for help?
0,90,26,TYLER,"Sorry, but I couldn't take the chance. For generations, the R'Yol have met with nothing but fear and mistrust."
0,90,26,JACK,"Well, sure if you go around tricking people."
0,90,26,TYLER,My kind do not embrace technology. We've never been good fighters. Our ability to disquise ourselves is our only advantage. Now the Goa'Uld are trying to learn our secrets. We've been hunted to extinction.
0,90,26,JACK,You got some place to go?
0,90,26,TYLER,"A group of us have started a new colony on a planet in an isolated part of the galaxy. After I return, we'll bury the gate. and you'll never heard of us again."
0,90,27,JACK,What do we got?
0,90,27,TEAL'C,We are not alone.
0,90,28,JACK,Looks like they're gonna be here a while.
0,90,28,TEAL'C,We must act before the reinforcements arrive.
0,90,28,JACK,"I don't think so, Teal'C. There's too many of them."
0,90,28,TYLER,"I'll surrender. Once they have me, they'll leave. I'm the one they're after."
0,90,28,JACK,"That's ... very brave of you and all, but the last thing we need is for the Goa'Uld to figure out how you do the ... thing ... you do."
0,90,28,TYLER,Then I won't surrender. I'll just lead them away from the gate. That'll give you a chance to get thru.
0,90,28,JACK,"You said yourself They'd never stop hunting you. Now, we've trusted each other this far. We could use a little more fire power, however. Daniel? Stay with ... What is your name anyway?"
0,90,28,TYLER,Kal'Aie.
0,90,28,JACK,
0,90,28,TEAL'C,This canon must still be operational.
0,90,28,JACK,"Like the attitude, Teal'C."
0,90,28,TYLER,This is all my fault. If I had revealed myself to you from the beginning ... this could have been avoided.
0,90,28,DANNY,"Well, we understand. No one's blaming you."
0,90,28,TYLER,Please tell Colonel O'Neill ... I appreciate everything he's done for me.
0,90,28,DANNY,What are you talking about?
0,90,28,HAMMOND,"I take it you're waiting to see me, Colonel."
0,90,28,SIMMONS,"Yes, Sir. For the better part of an hour in fact."
0,90,28,HAMMOND,What about?
0,90,28,SIMMONS,I have come to believe that you allow your personel feelings to influence your command decisions.
0,90,28,HAMMOND,How I run my command is none of your DAMN business!
0,90,28,SIMMONS,"It's the security of this country, Sir."
0,90,28,HAMMOND,"This investigation has nothing to do with the security of this country, and you KNOW it."
0,90,28,SIMMONS,Off-World teams have been compromised. Existing safeguards are ineffective. The SGC is an accident waiting to happen.
0,90,28,HAMMOND,"I don't know who issued your orders, Simmons, but I've got a pretty good idea."
0,90,28,SIMMONS,"General, with all due respect, it doesn't matter WHO issued my orders. What matters is that in carrying OUT my orders, I found things to be very, very wrong here."
0,90,28,HAMMOND,"You're being used, Colonel. I let this investigation go on long enough to make a few phone calls. I learned enough to know, you are politically motivated."
0,90,28,SIMMONS,"Sir, I think your missing my point ..."
0,90,28,HAMMOND,"If it's a fight you're looking for, Colonel, my Washington connections go alot higher than yours."
0,90,28,SIMMONS,"Administrations change, Sir."
0,90,28,HAMMOND,"So do orders! Now, do I need to have you escorted OFF my base?!"
0,90,28,SIMMONS,"That won't be necessary, General. I know how to leave gracefully. I only hope YOU do."
0,90,29,SAM,Daniel?
0,90,29,JACK,Hey! Where's Tyler?
0,90,29,DANNY,
0,90,29,JACK,"Oh, for cryin' o ... He's tryin' to be a hero."
0,90,29,SAM,There's only a few Jaffa left. We can take em.
0,90,29,TEAL'C,"This may be our best chance for escape, O'Neill."
0,90,30,JACK,"You're lucky your not a Lt. under my command, I'd have your ASS for this."
0,90,30,TYLER,You could have escaped!
0,90,30,JACK,We don't leave our people behind.
0,90,30,TYLER,But ... I'm NOT one of your people.
0,90,30,JACK,Could've fooled me ... actually you DID fool me. Come on. Let's go.
0,90,30,TYLER,What about the Jaffa at the gate?
0,90,30,JACK,"They weren't a problem. You know. Before you bury your gate and all that, you should know that ... not everyone you meet is gonna try to hunt you down. We could be ... Allies."
0,90,30,TYLER,"It's not my decision to make, but ... I will tell the others what happened here. Might just convince them that we don't have to hide forever. Maybe then you could take me fishing."
