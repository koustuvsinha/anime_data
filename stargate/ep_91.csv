0,91,0,"""RED SKY""",By Ron Wilkerson We begin with the traveler's view of going thru the gate ... then the ground tumbling like when you're throw out of the wormhole at a great deal of force. ;) Daniel and Teal'C are shown getting up from the ramp where they were thrown.
0,91,0,DANNY,
0,91,0,JACK,Carter?
0,91,0,SAM,"I don't know, Sir. Margin of error in calculating planetary shift used to cause the rough ride, but we fixed it."
0,91,0,JACK,Carter?!
0,91,0,SAM,We did have to over ride some of the dialing protocols in order to get a lock. I'll check the dialing computer when we get home.
0,91,0,JACK,It's bright.
0,91,0,SAM,"Yes, Sir! This planet's much closer to it's sun then Earth."
0,91,0,JACK,Festive.
0,91,0,DANNY,This is interesting. I couldn't see these writings from the MALP.
0,91,0,JACK,What's it say?
0,91,0,DANNY,They're really similar to those we found on Cimmeria. Could be a connection here to the Asgard.
0,91,0,JACK,What's it SAY?
0,91,0,DANNY,I don't know.
0,91,0,SAM,You think it's a protected planet?
0,91,0,JACK,"Well, Teal'C wasn't Zapped away."
0,91,0,TEAL'C,Then there is no Thor's Hammer here.
0,91,0,DANNY,"Well, they wouldn't need one if it was named in the Goa'uld / Asgard Treaty."
0,91,1,JACK,Hey! You! Come on out!
0,91,1,DANNY,"We're not, uh ... we're not here to hurt you ... we're explorers from a place called Earth ... you might, uh ... you might know it as Midgard. I'm ... I'm Daniel Jackson, this is uh ..."
0,91,1,MAN,I am Elrad. Flameman of the 39th order of Katal. My congregation and I were on our way here for Morning Prayer when we saw a great wave burst forth from the Anulus.
0,91,1,JACK,Anulus? I like that.
0,91,1,ELRAD,
0,91,1,JACK,Not anymore. Thor loves this guy!
0,91,1,ELRAD,You know of Thor?!
0,91,1,JACK,"Oh, yeah! He's a buddy!"
0,91,1,ELRAD,"Well, then. COME FORTH! It is a time for rejoicing! Freyr has sent us visitors from Midgard!"
0,91,1,DANNY,"Freyr is the god of Sun and Rain, right?"
0,91,1,ELRAD,"Yes, our protector. Ally of Thor. Friends of the Gods are welcome here."
0,91,1,JACK,What do you got here?
0,91,1,ELRAD,Come! Our village is this way!
0,91,2,DANNY,"It's as if ... the Norse culture evolved in this world to modern times, while continuing to worship the Ancient Gods."
0,91,2,ELRAD,This is Brother Malcus. He is Chief Acolyte within our order.
0,91,2,MALCUS,You must leave. At once.
0,91,2,JACK,We just GOT here!
0,91,2,ELRAD,These are not just ANY strangers ... they came thru the Anulus.
0,91,2,MALCUS,This one ... bears the mark of evil!
0,91,2,ELRAD,He is a friend of THOR!
0,91,2,MALCUS,The people will NOT stand for this.
0,91,2,ELRAD,You mean you will antagonize them until they agree with you!
0,91,2,JACK,Friendly guy!
0,91,2,ELRAD,"You must forgive Malcus. He has a suspicious nature, and we have never before been visited by ELVES."
0,91,2,JACK,"""Elves?"""
0,91,2,ELRAD,You've traveled by way of the Gods. You say you know them well.
0,91,2,DANNY,Norse mythology Freyr was the rule of Elves. They can bring good or bad tidings.
0,91,2,ELRAD,We certainly hope you bring us well.
0,91,3,JACK,Carter? What just happened?
0,91,3,ELRAD,The Eye of Odin grows dim.
0,91,3,SAM,Some sort of shift in the light frequency.
0,91,3,JACK,Good. I thought I was having a stroke.
0,91,3,MALCUS,
0,91,3,JACK,What?
0,91,3,ELRAD,Be calm! Is it true?!
0,91,3,JACK,
0,91,3,SAM,"I don't know, Sir."
0,91,3,MALCUS,It is no coincidence that this happens moments after they arrive! The Elves are the harbingers of our DOOM!
0,91,5,MALCUS,"Leave us, or be driven out."
0,91,5,ELRAD,"Malcus, the darkening of the Eye of Odin is the will of the Gods, you can not blame the messengers. We must go to the Hall of Wisdom, and pray for forgiveness!"
0,91,5,DANNY,"""Hall of Wisdom"" ... that sounds like the place the Cimmerians went to visit Thor."
0,91,5,JACK,Carter. What the HECK'S going on?!
0,91,5,SAM,"Somehow the light-spectrum of the sun has shifted toward infer-red. Now, if it continues this way, all the green plant will die. The plants goes, the oxygen supply ..."
0,91,5,JACK,"Yeah, yeah, yeah ... >"
0,91,5,SAM,The MALP should give us more detailed data. It's sensors are more sophisticated.
0,91,5,JACK,Good. You and Teal'C head back to the ... Anulus ... see what you can find out ... Daniel? See if these folks have got an Asgard phone.
0,91,6,MALCUS,"We beseech thee Oh, Freyr to have mercy upon us. Make peace with our Great Father Odin. In doing so, remove the terrible curse from our gentle land. In the name of our Lord, Freyr, be it so. We ..."
0,91,7,JACK,Sorry. We didn't mean to interrupt.
0,91,7,MALCUS,"Haven't you done enough damage here, Elves?"
0,91,7,ELRAD,"Show some respect, Malcus. They are sent by the Gods. We should hear their words."
0,91,7,DANNY,We were just wondering if you ever speak directly to Freyr.
0,91,7,ELRAD,
0,91,7,DANNY,"Right. You mentioned a Hall of Wisdom. This is it, isn't it?"
0,91,7,ELRAD,"No, this is a Temple."
0,91,7,DANNY,Right.
0,91,7,ELRAD,Malcus and I were about to go to the Hall to seek Freyr's wisdom on behalf of our people.
0,91,7,DANNY,Would you mind if we went with you?
0,91,7,JACK,We could put in a good word.
0,91,7,ELRAD,By all means! Come!
0,91,7,MALCUS,"Bow your heads, and prepare to meet Our Lord."
0,91,7,ELRAD,"Lord Freyer, Lord of the Aser, God of Katal, grant us an audience that we may share your wisdom."
0,91,8,JACK,I better get it back!
0,91,9,HOLIGRAM,I am Freyr. For what reason have you come before me?
0,91,9,ELRAD,"Oh, Lord, Freyr. Forgive us for disturbing you, but we seek your wisdom."
0,91,9,MALCUS,The arrival of these outsiders has caused the Eye of Odin to grow dim. We fear it is Ragnarok.
0,91,9,DANNY,That's the end of time.
0,91,9,JACK,Thank you.
0,91,9,ELRAD,We beg you to restore Odin's light.
0,91,9,HOLOGRAM,"You are wise to seek my council, but only thru FAITH will you prove worthy of my benevolence."
0,91,9,MALCUS,Do you desire us to put these outsiders to death? They could be drawn and courted before nightfall. >
0,91,9,JACK,"That's a bit HARSH, isn't it?"
0,91,9,HOLOGRAM,"In time, I will sail to the Plain of Vigrid, where my value will be fought with Surtur ..."
0,91,9,MALCUS,Swords ... it is the end time !
0,91,9,ELRAD,Patience!
0,91,9,HOLOGRAM,"Likewise, you must face your own fears, as knowledge of the ultimate conflict. How you deal with fear is will prove your worthiness. I wish you well on your voyage."
0,91,10,DANNY,It's a recording.
0,91,10,JACK,Really?
0,91,11,MALCUS,I told you. It IS Ragnarok. Lord Freyr tells us to prepare for our death.
0,91,11,JACK,"That's a bit of a negative spin with the ole paraphrasing, isn't it?"
0,91,11,MALCUS,I have been interpreting the Word of the Gods for many years.
0,91,11,ELRAD,I'm afraid I must agree with Malcus.
0,91,11,JACK,"Hang on! Look, I know I'm the outsider here ..."
0,91,11,MALCUS,You DARE question the Will of the Gods?!
0,91,11,JACK,"No, just ... your interpretation."
0,91,11,DANNY,You sure you want to get in the middle of this?
0,91,11,JACK,"I'm not sure how to get OUT of the middle of this. Look, folks. Does Freyr plant your crops for you? Huh? Does he ... harvest them? Does he build your HOMES for you?"
0,91,11,ELRAD,Those are the tasks of our own hands.
0,91,11,JACK,Exactly! You've always had free-will before ... why not now? Maybe this ultimate conflict is a test of your ingenuity and courage.
0,91,11,MALCUS,
0,91,11,JACK,"Jump in any time here, by the way."
0,91,11,DANNY,I don't think this is a good idea.
0,91,11,MALCUS,"In the past, Lord Freyr has always told us to face our fears, and NOT interfere with the WAYS of the GODS!"
0,91,11,ELRAD,"I agree, Malcus. We must do the God's will, but perhaps these strangers are a part of their plan."
0,91,11,MALCUS,
0,91,11,JACK,"Elrad, listen to me ... we can help your people. We've been in this situation before. TRUST me! We can work MIRICLES!"
0,91,11,ELRAD,"I trust in Freyr. If you are here to do his bidding, either to doom us ... or to save us ... then ... so be it."
0,91,11,DANNY,They don't hear us.
0,91,11,JACK,"Elves, that's what we look like to them."
0,91,11,DANNY,That's what we look like to them .
0,91,11,JACK,"Whatever ... Carter come us with. Hey, fellas."
0,91,11,SAM,"I got a theory, Sir."
0,91,11,JACK,Is it ... Miraculous?
0,91,11,SAM,"Actually, it is. I think the wormhole that we used to travel here passed directly thru this planet's sun. That might be why we had a problem dialing here in the first place."
0,91,11,DANNY,What? We should never have connected with this planet?
0,91,11,SAM,"Well, at least not with the current planetary alignment. The light from the sun suddenly shifted toward the red spectrum after we got here. As far as I know, the ONLY way that could happen was if an unstable, superheavy element, probably plutonium, was introduced to the sun's nuclear reaction. Sort of a ... subatomic poisoning."
0,91,11,DANNY,Wait a minute ... OK ... how did WE do that?
0,91,11,SAM,"Well, somehow, the plutonium piggybacked onto our wormhole from another star system, and bonded with their sun as we passed thru it."
0,91,11,JACK,
0,91,11,TEAL'C,"We could not have known, O'Neill."
0,91,11,SAM,"The fact that the 'gate wouldn't dial here when we first tried, leads me to believe that there's some sort of safety protocol built into the gate system designed to prevent exactly this sort of thing."
0,91,11,JACK,So ... design flaw?
0,91,11,SAM,"No. Sir, we bypassed some of the normal dialing protocols. The fact is, this planet is dying, and it's probably because of us."
0,91,11,JACK,"But you can fix it, right? Teal'C, maybe you should hang out here. These Asgard devices don't know you like we do."
0,91,12,DANNY,
0,91,13,HOLIGRAM,I am Freyr. For what reason have you come before me?
0,91,13,JACK,We'd like to talk to the real Asgard. Thor if he is available.
0,91,13,HOLOGRAM,You are wise to seek my council. But only thru FAITH will you prove worthy of my benevolence.
0,91,13,JACK,"Yada, yada ... uh ... Carter, you wanna pull the plug on this guy?"
0,91,13,SAM,It looks like this is the emitter that generates ...
0,91,13,DANNY,"Well, we've either made contact with the Asgard, or we've trapped ourselves deep within a vault of solid rock. That's better."
0,91,13,ASGARD,I am Freyr. Protector of the Katal world.
0,91,13,JACK,"Uh ... yes, sorry to bother you, can we ... talk to ... Thor?"
0,91,13,FREYR,Commander Thor is in a distant part of the galaxy. He is not available. You are the one called O'Neill?
0,91,13,JACK,I am the one.
0,91,13,FREYR,We named a warship after you. Short lived as it was.
0,91,13,JACK,"Yes, that one."
0,91,13,FREYR,Why have you come to this world?
0,91,13,JACK,Exploring. That's what we do.
0,91,13,FREYR,"Katal falls under our ""Protected Planets Treaty"" with the Goa'uld. I would hope you have not dispelled our current belief system. The Asgard"
0,91,13,JACK,"Aw! Don't worry! We haven't blown your cover. However, we do have a SMALL little problem that could use some of that ASGARD magic."
0,91,13,FREYR,Are you implying that our technology is some kind of trickery?
0,91,13,JACK,You sure Thor's not around somewhere?
0,91,13,SAM,Sir? If I may?
0,91,13,JACK,Yeah. Knock yourself out.
0,91,13,SAM,"We may have inadvertently, totally accidentally, cause a foreign element into the Katal Sun."
0,91,13,FREYR,How?
0,91,13,SAM,"Ah, well, actually I was hoping you could help us out on that one. Is it possible that our wormhole to pick up a superheavy element, and deposit it on the sun as we passed thru it?"
0,91,13,FREYR,There are safety protocols in place on the system to prevent wormhole connections that could cause just this reaction.
0,91,13,SAM,"Uh ... yeah ... see? We have our own dialing computer, and sometimes we bypass a few steps in order to get a lock. We're still experimenting."
0,91,13,FREYR,I see.
0,91,13,SAM,We could really use your help here.
0,91,13,FREYR,I'm afraid I can not assist you.
0,91,13,JACK,Why not?
0,91,13,FREYR,It is not the Asgard's responsibility to undo every error you make. This technology is advanced beyond your knowledge.
0,91,13,JACK,Excuse me!? There is a whole planet full of people that are going to DIE.
0,91,13,DANNY,"Um ... this may be our mistake, but the Katal people depend on you. You set up their belief system. They think that You are their God, and you will protect them."
0,91,13,FREYR,"From the Goa'uld, yes."
0,91,13,JACK,"Forget all that! Come on! We're FRIENDS! We help you , you help us. That's the way it works. Carter's idea saved you from the Replicators. Now, we're calling in the marker."
0,91,13,FREYR,"Ultimately, the decision is not mine."
0,91,13,JACK,"Then , may I speak to whomever decides?!"
0,91,13,FREYR,It is possible. Prepare to meet the Asgard High Council.
0,91,13,JACK,I'm prepared. Right now. Let's go.
0,91,13,FREYR,Step to the place where I stand.
0,91,13,JACK,I'm sorta prepared.
0,91,13,DANNY,You want me to ...
0,91,13,JACK,I got it. Hello? ECHO!
0,91,13,ASGARD,Colonel Jack O'Neill of Earth ... Welcome to the Asgard High Council Chamber.
0,91,13,JACK,"Yeah, thanks for seeing me on such short notice. I assume you CAN see me."
0,91,13,JACK,Did Freyr mention why I'm here?
0,91,13,FREYR,"Yes, Colonel. They're aware of the circumstances surrounding your request."
0,91,13,JACK,"Oh, hey! There! I didn't see you. You guys all kinda look ... Thor's not here, is he?"
0,91,13,AHC,"No, he is not."
0,91,13,AHC,"As Freyr explained, we are unable to assist you in this matter, O'Neill. Though your actions were unintentional, unfortunately, the Katal people will perish."
0,91,13,JACK,"Hey! This is not entirely our fault! I mean, you could have warned us about this ... gate thru the sun ... thing. Or for that matter, you could have given us a list of the planets that were off-limits."
0,91,13,AHC,"Both points are true. However, neither is recent enough to interfere."
0,91,13,JACK,"You're interfering right now! These people think you're their GODS! Granted, you're not Goa'ulds, but you're still pretending to be something you're not."
0,91,13,FREYR,"You are correct. However, when we saved these people from the Goa'uld, they were not ready to have their beliefs completely stripped away. In time, when they are ready, the Katal will know the truth."
0,91,13,JACK,"Yeah, well, there's the snag ... they WON'T. They'll be DEAD. I don't get it. You obviously saved them once. Why not again?"
0,91,13,AHC,It is not that simple.
0,91,13,JACK,"Yes it is! You've got the technology, don't you?"
0,91,13,AHC,Yes!
0,91,13,JACK,"Ok, fine. We made a mistake ... a BIG mistake ... and we're very, very sorry! But we also saved your little grey butts from the Replicators, and now we want your help. I'm not asking you to change the course of development! Just fix the damn sun! No one'll know. We won't tell."
0,91,13,AHC,"Unfortunately, we can not."
0,91,13,JACK,
0,91,14,DANNY,"""Little Grey Butts!""?"
0,91,14,SAM,Yeah.
0,91,14,FREYR,It would be in violation of our treaty with the Goa'uld.
0,91,14,JACK,What?
0,91,14,AHC,"The treaty states that the people of the planet protected will be free from Goa'uld, however, subsection 424 says the people on the planets can not be artificially advanced thru our technological needs. Using our technology to prevent a natural disaster would be a violation of that order, and would nullify the treaty as a whole. The Goa'uld would be free to invade any protected planet ... Including Earth."
0,91,14,JACK,"Oh, ... you sure?"
0,91,14,AHC,Yes. The war with the Replicator rages on here in our galaxy. We do not have the military force to defend every planet in the treaty. You would be vulnerable to a Goa'uld attack.
0,91,14,JACK,
0,91,14,AHC,"Even if you could make that decision on behalf of your planet, O'Neill, you can not make it for every other planet that could be effected."
0,91,14,JACK,I ... suppose ... not.
0,91,14,AHC,We are all deeply disturbed that this disaster could not be diverted. We wish there was a way.
0,91,14,JACK,"Well, they're not dead yet. Maybe there is."
0,91,14,AHC,"If that is the case, the solution would be up to you."
0,91,14,JACK,Why? That went well!
0,91,14,SAM,"Sir, I've been thinking."
0,91,14,JACK,"I'd be SHOCKED if you EVER stopped, Carter!"
0,91,14,SAM,"Here, OK. Let's say these are the unstable plutonium molecules that are poisoning the sun."
0,91,14,OK ...,
0,91,14,SAM,"What if these are molecules of a more stable, super heavy element, say with an atomic weight above"
0,91,14,JACK,Sure! I can think of a few.
0,91,14,SAM,"Actually, they don't occur in nature, at least not on Earth. But I have read about such elements being created in super colliders, at least in theory."
0,91,14,DANNY,You realize you're mixing your apples and ...
0,91,14,SAM,"If we could introduce these stable, superheavys into the Katal sun, they would bind with the plutonium molecule rendering them inert. > The sun then could be restored to it's normal nuclear reaction."
0,91,14,JACK,Huh? How bout that?!
0,91,14,SAM,"Well, this is all very theoretical, Sir."
0,91,14,JACK,"I have great confidence in you, Carter. Go on back to the SGC and ... confuse Hammond."
0,91,14,SAM,"Yes, Sir."
0,91,14,HAMMOND,A rocket?
0,91,14,SAM,"With a payload of the super heavy element I've indicated. We send it in stages thru the Stargate to Katal, and assemble it there. When it's complete, we launch it into the sun."
0,91,14,HAMMOND,Will it get there in time?
0,91,14,SAM,"We have 3 months before the plutonium reaction in the sun become irreversible. If we can launch inside 3 weeks, we can just make it."
0,91,14,HAMMOND,Have you considered other options.
0,91,14,SAM,"The other option we've considered could be a one in a million shot, Sir. The rocket gives us better than 50/50 odds."
0,91,14,HAMMOND,"Rockets don't exactly grow on trees, Major."
0,91,14,SAM,"I know that, Sir. However, as you know, the Air Force is currently planning a launch from Vandenburg."
0,91,14,HAMMOND,"Major, do you realize how much has been invested in that project?"
0,91,14,SAM,"I'm aware of that, Sir. It's hard to put a price on the Katal People."
0,91,15,MALCUS,Colonel?!
0,91,15,JACK,Shouldn't you be off inciting a mob?
0,91,15,MALCUS,Look at the sky. Ragnerack grows ever closer ... your MACHINE does nothing!
0,91,15,JACK,It's a rocket. It won't work until we launch it. We can't launch it until we BUILD it!
0,91,15,TEAL'C,Time still remains before the sun does permanent damage to your world.
0,91,15,MALCUS,All they have done is bring more outsiders!
0,91,15,DANNY,You have to be patient.
0,91,15,MALCUS,"The problem grows ever worse as long as you are here. If you can't see that the Gods wish you to leave, we will be forced to make it clear on their behalf."
0,91,15,ELRAD,"Malcus, this is not the way of the Katal. If the Gods did not want them here, they wouldn't BE here!"
0,91,15,MALCUS,If their presence is truly part of the test ... then we have failed ... miserably!
0,91,16,SAM,"General, we're ahead of schedule."
0,91,16,HAMMOND,This should be the last shipment of parts.
0,91,16,SAM,Any word yet on the HG2340?
0,91,16,HAMMOND,"Frankly, I never thought it would be easier to get the rocket."
0,91,16,SAM,"Sir, without the superheavy element, this whole thing would have been a big waste of time."
0,91,16,HAMMOND,"Don't worry, Major."
0,91,16,SAM,Doctor MacClarean.
0,91,16,MACCLAREAN,"Very impressive operation you've got here. I hope you consider yourself lucky, Major."
0,91,16,HAMMOND,Doctor MacClarean finally decided that a peek of the SGC was worth the exchange.
0,91,16,MACCLAREAN,It took me 5 years to make that much
0,91,16,SAM,"Well, maybe one day, you'll be able to save the planet your MacClarean is saving."
0,91,16,MACCLAREAN,Did you say MacClarean?
0,91,16,HAMMOND,Sounds like a good name to me. I'll use it in my official report to the Pentagon.
0,91,16,MACCLAREAN,I don't wanna be in your way. You obviously have a job to do here. Good luck Major.
0,91,16,SAM,"Thank you Doctor. That's the last of it, Sir. We've got everything we need."
0,91,16,JACK,Good.
0,91,16,SAM,Daniel and Teal'C?
0,91,16,JACK,
0,91,16,SAM,
0,91,17,DANNY,What happened?
0,91,17,SAM,Somebody set a fire.
0,91,17,DANNY,Anybody hurt?
0,91,17,SAM,We lost 2 members of SG-6. The rocket was destroyed.
0,91,17,JACK,You STUPID Son of a BITCH!
0,91,17,MALCUS,The Gods have spoken!
0,91,17,JACK,"You've just killed 2 of my men, and screwed your whole planet!!!!"
0,91,17,MALCUS,I'll screw all their lives to serve the Gods.
0,91,17,JACK,You coward ... Why did you kill yourself?
0,91,17,MALCUS,I would gladly die to serve the Gods!
0,91,17,JACK,I'm gonna shoot ...
0,91,17,DANNY,Jack!
0,91,17,SIR!,
0,91,17,ELRAD,"Stop, please! I am truly sorry for what has happened ) Malcus has acted without my knowledge, He will be punished. PLEASE! More death serves NO ONE!"
0,91,17,JACK,More death is exactly what you people are gonna get.
0,91,18,MAN,Let's get back to the
0,91,19,DANNY,Jack! STOP! We CAN'T leave!
0,91,19,JACK,"The Hell we can't! Carter, Dial it up, get these people home!"
0,91,19,SAM,Sir ...
0,91,19,JACK,That's an ORDER!!!!
0,91,19,DANNY,"Jack, would you ju ... STOP!"
0,91,19,JACK,They killed 2 of my
0,91,19,DANNY,"Yes, they did. But not all these people are responsible for that. And the ones that were were ... just doing what they believed was right."
0,91,19,JACK,I really don't care.
0,91,19,DANNY,"Well, I do. And leaving right now would be redeemable."
0,91,19,JACK,In who's eyes? The Asgard? They HAD their chance.
0,91,19,SAM,"Sir, I essentially pressed the button that could end this civilization."
0,91,19,JACK,
0,91,19,SAM,I couldn't live with myself if I just walked away now.
0,91,19,TEAL'C,I do not believe the majority of the people of this world support the actions of Malcus.
0,91,19,JACK,"What, then?"
0,91,19,DANNY,Relocate them.
0,91,19,TEAL'C,"Their ties to this world are strong, DanielJackson."
0,91,19,DANNY,"Well, we have to give them the option. Then it's their choice."
0,91,19,SAM,"Sir, we still have the MacClarean. With your permission, I'd like to go back to the SGC, and run a few more simulations."
0,91,19,DANNY,
0,91,19,ELRAD,That is for the Gods to decide.
0,91,19,DANNY,Right. But consider this ... that the Gods are giving you another choice.
0,91,19,ELRAD,What is that?
0,91,19,DANNY,"The chance to move to another world. You can come thru the Anulus with us, it's really, it's very simple."
0,91,19,ELRAD,"If Freyr wished us to leave this world, he would come to take us away in his Chariot."
0,91,19,DANNY,"He does. He wishes you to leave. He's very busy right now, and he sent us to take you to our world. If you don't go, you will all die."
0,91,19,ELRAD,"Your efforts are noble, but if our destruction is the will of the gods, we must face our fate bravely."
0,91,19,JACK,
0,91,19,TEAL'C,The Katal were not convinced?
0,91,19,JACK,Nope. Because YOU didn't say what needed to be said.
0,91,19,DANNY,"Well, what would YOU have said? Wait! What are you gonna SAY?!"
0,91,19,JACK,"Hey, folks. Join me over here ... Come on! Come on in here folks, I got a few things to say."
0,91,19,DANNY,What are you doing?
0,91,19,JACK,"Telling them the truth, Daniel."
0,91,19,DANNY,Whether or not a God really exists is not as important as whether or not a BELIEF in God really exists.
0,91,19,JACK,You wouldn't be saying that if we were talking about a Goa'uld.
0,91,19,DANNY,We're not ... talking about a Goa'uld.
0,91,19,ELRAD,Have we not made our position clear?
0,91,19,JACK,"Yes! Yes, you have. I just don't think we've made OURSELVES clear."
0,91,19,DANNY,"Jack, the Asgard ..."
0,91,19,JACK,... are NOT ... Gods!
0,91,20,JACK,"Hi, folks, listen. You all know Freyr, right? Big guy, kinda good-lookin' lot of fancy gold armor? Well, here's a flash for ya. That's NOT what he looks like."
0,91,20,ELRAD,What do you mean?
0,91,20,JACK,"He's an Alien who's been pretending to be your god. He doesn't have a Chariot ... he's got a SPACESHIP! ) A spaceship. Big machine like the one we were building. Only his is WAY better ... and ... not ... blown up. I'm not kidding you folks. This little fellow is about 3 feet tall, got clammy grey skin, big black eyes, and skinny, tiny little arms and legs, like toothpicks. They think you need to believe in a god! That you're not developed enough as a culture to think for yourselves."
0,91,20,ELRAD,Enough!
0,91,20,JACK,"Elrad, listen to me! These Aliens have the power to help you ... they chose NOT to!"
0,91,20,ELRAD,"I am sorry ... for what happened to your people. I know you think you are trying to help us, but, PLEASE! It's time you leave."
0,91,20,PEOPLE,"You should go, please go! You've said enough, just go!"
0,91,21,JACK,
0,91,22,HAMMOND,"I thought the odds of success in this scenario was one in a million, Major."
0,91,22,SAM,"Yes, Sir. But I now believe we can increase that chance to 1%."
0,91,22,JACK,"It's your call, General. I only understand about 1% of what she says half the time anyway."
0,91,22,HAMMOND,Run it by me again.
0,91,22,SAM,"We send the MacClarean thru the wormhole to Katal. Now, based on the distance from Earth, and the rate of travel, I tried to calculate the exact time we shut down the gate. so that the MacClarean stops short of reaching the planet , and actually ends up IN their sun."
0,91,22,JACK,"I thought when something was IN a wormhole, it existed only as ... energy. That you needed another stargate to turn it back into solid matter."
0,91,22,SAM,"Actually, you absolutely correct, Sir."
0,91,22,JACK,
0,91,22,SAM,"Yes! You see? It's the stargate on the other side that actually reintegrates the matter into it's pre organized form. Without it the energy in the wormhole would not rematerialize in it's base form. Now, in the case of a person, that would be very bad, but in the case of an element, it shouldn't be a problem."
0,91,22,JACK,I was right!
0,91,22,HAMMOND,
0,91,22,SAM,"Sending MALP thru. Payload is en route. Executing controlled shutdown ... now! Well, there's only one way to know if it worked."
0,91,22,ELRED,"Praying, Teal'C and Danny are there) Brothers and sisters, at these times, it is important for us to come together as a family. We must remember the great gifts of Freyr, and we must be grateful for the lives that he has given us. In this, the troubled time, we must still remember ..."
0,91,22,DANNY,They agreed to let us stay as long as we ... don't try to tell them Freyr's not a God.
0,91,22,JACK,I don't think we'll be staying.
0,91,22,TEAL'C,"Did your method not succeed, MajorCarter?"
0,91,22,SAM,"It doesn't look good, I think we missed."
0,91,23,SAM,We should have noticed the change by now.
0,91,23,JACK,Let's go.
0,91,23,DANNY,"I wanna tell them ... and say good-bye. Sorry, it ... didn't work. But, it's not too late to change your mind about leaving."
0,91,23,ELRAD,"Great protector. Oh, Lord Freyr, accept thou frailties and forgive our sins."
0,91,23,DANNY,"We beg You give us mercy, and return the light that gives us life. Good-Bye."
0,91,24,JACK,Am I having a stroke?
0,91,24,ELRAD,"Blessed be Freyr! Bow your heads, and thank him for granting our prayers."
0,91,24,SAM,"I'm pretty sure we didn't do this, Sir. At least not on our own."
0,91,24,TEAL'C,The Asgard.
0,91,24,SAM,They said they wouldn't help.
0,91,24,JACK,Overtly.
0,91,24,SAM,"Sir, are you saying that by starting the process, we gave 'em the opportunity to step in without the Goa'uld knowing?"
0,91,24,JACK,A way of saving face. Technical look over?
0,91,24,DANNY,"Or NOT! Well, we'll never know for sure will we?"
