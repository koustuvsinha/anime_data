0,93,0,"""BEAST OF BURDEN""",By Peter DeLuise
0,93,1,DANNY,"As you know, Over the past year, I have been studying the Unas of P3X-888, and I've made some AMAZING discoveries about their social structure and culture. I've also been able to categorize over 70 different words from their ... language. But, during a review of the latest digital images, I came across this ... These men, whoever they are, abducted the Unas I refer to as Chak'Ka."
0,93,1,SAM,That's the one that kidnapped you?
0,93,1,DANNY,"Same one. Their dress indicates prenuturalization, but they don't seem to have any Jaffa tattoos, so the presence of Goa'Uld weapons is ... contradictory."
0,93,1,TEAL'C,Indeed.
0,93,1,JACK,What would they want with an Unas?
0,93,1,DANNY,I don't know ... but I'd like to find out.
0,93,1,HAMMOND,What are you suggesting?
0,93,1,DANNY,"Well, like I said, I'd like to find out what they want with an Unas."
0,93,1,JACK,FOr the record ... I don't ... care. I care.
0,93,1,DANNY,I also think it would be relevant to investigate how they got Goa'Uld weapons ... and from where.
0,93,1,TEAL'C,They may have other Goa'Uld technology as well.
0,93,1,JACK,Now see? THAT I really care about.
0,93,1,DANNY,"And if possible, I'd like to make every effort to RESCUE ... Chak'Ka."
0,93,1,JACK,The Unas?
0,93,1,DANNY,"Remember most of the Unas we've encountered have had Goa'Uld symbiotes controlling them ... Chak'Ka is an UNGoa'Ulded Unus, and intelligent being who learned to *trust humans* because of me."
0,93,1,JACK,And ...?
0,93,1,DANNY,"These images were taken prior to the abduction. See, every time I went back with SG-11 to retrieve the video footage, I would leave Chak'Ka a gift. It's uh ... it's an energy bar ... something that helped me ... *Break thru* when we first met. I left the bait for their trap."
0,93,1,SAM,How do we find out where these men took him?
0,93,2,JACK,"Well, General. If they've got Goa'Uld weapons, you gotta wonder what else they got."
0,93,2,HAMMOND,You have a go.
0,93,2,DANNY,Thank you.
0,93,3,SAM,"The UAV shows the nearest of the surrounding towns to be 3 clicks in that direction. Evidence of a substantial population, lots of cultivated fields."
0,93,3,JACK,Farmers?! ... Farmers with Staff Weapons.
0,93,4,DANNY,Domestication.
0,93,4,JACK,"Yeah! We'll check things out down there ... Carter, you and Teal'C hang back, cover us in case these folks don't like visitors. Any ideas?"
0,93,4,DANNY,"Well, let's ... see how far honesty gets us."
0,93,5,CALLER,Do not fear ... it is dead.
0,93,5,JACK,Yeah. Shoot something like that in the back a couple times ...
0,93,5,CALLER,Who are you?
0,93,5,DANNY,We're travelers ... *peaceful* travelers.
0,93,5,CALLER,Where do you come from? I've not seen your kind before.
0,93,5,DANNY,"Well, actually, we came thru the stargate. The ... um ... ."
0,93,5,CALLER,Chappa'Ai?
0,93,5,DANNY,Chappa'Ai.
0,93,5,CALLER,Really?
0,93,5,DANNY,Yes.
0,93,6,CALLER,No one has come thru the Chappa'Ai for as long as anyone remembers.
0,93,6,JACK,"Well, now you'll have a story to tell your grandkids."
0,93,6,DANNY,We come from a planet called Earth.
0,93,6,CALLER,What do you want?
0,93,6,DANNY,Actually we came to ... trade.
0,93,6,JACK,Hmn?
0,93,6,CALLER,Really?
0,93,6,DANNY,We're looking for an Unas.
0,93,6,CALLER,Well then. You've come to the right place. I'm the most respected dealer of Unas in this land. My name is Burrock.
0,93,6,DANNY,"I'm Daniel Jackson, this is Colonel Jack O'Neill."
0,93,6,BURROCK,Colonel?
0,93,6,DANNY,"Yes, it means he's our head ... trader."
0,93,6,JACK,
0,93,6,BURROCK,I like that! And you can call me Colonel Burrock. It is our custom to welcome visitors with a drink. Will you join me?
0,93,6,JACK,"It is our custom TO drink ... of course! Honesty, huh?"
0,93,6,DANNY,We're Traders.
0,93,6,JACK,Yeah.
0,93,6,DANNY,We traded ... trade ... traders ...
0,93,7,DANNY,Thank you.
0,93,7,BURROCK,You thank a
0,93,7,DANNY,"Yes, uh ... positive reinforcement. We find it a successful method of training."
0,93,7,BURROCK,I'm curious to learn more about your methods. And more about where you came from.
0,93,7,DANNY,"So, no one else has actually come thru the Chappa'Ai?"
0,93,7,BURROCK,"I have often wondered why there are so many symbols on the pedestal. I stood for hours on end pressing different combinations, but nothing happened. The fact that you have come here from a place we do not know, proves that I am right. The Chappa'Ai goes MANY places ... does it not?"
0,93,7,DANNY,Haven't you traveled to other worlds?
0,93,7,BURROCK,I have been to one other place. Just one time so far. I had to press seven different symbol ... to get the Chappa'Ai to open.
0,93,7,DANNY,And how did you learn those symbols?
0,93,7,BURROCK,"I paid dearly for them. They have been passed down thru the lineage of certain families since the ""Beast Wars""."
0,93,7,JACK,
0,93,7,BURROCK,"Generations ago, the Beasts enslaved our forefathers thru terror and oppression. They served the one with the glowing eyes."
0,93,7,DANNY,And what happened to him ... her?
0,93,7,BURROCK,"No one knows. One day he went away, did not return. Our forefathers, they learned how the beast weapons worked, and led an uprising. The war was bloody, raged for many years. But eventually the slaves primed , and the masters became the slaves. Since then, the Beasts have served us."
0,93,8,BURROCK,"Like the one at the auction that got away, this one comes from our local stock. I believe him to be untrainable. His head is not right. Even for a beast."
0,93,8,JACK,Maybe he's just pissed > cause you keep torturing him.
0,93,8,BURROCK,The unfortunate result of generations of inbreeding. I'm afraid he will have to be put down. Do you not have this problem where you come from?
0,93,8,JACK,"Ah, we've made some progress, actually."
0,93,8,BURROCK,"Interesting. The only choice we had was to introduce new blood. Fortunately, I was able to find some. This one ... will make me the wealthiest beastmaster in the land."
0,93,8,UNAS,Dan'El ...
0,93,8,BURROCK,He speaks?
0,93,8,DANNY,Yes.
0,93,8,BURROCK,Your name?
0,93,8,DANNY,Yes. That's because he's MINE!
0,93,8,BURROCK,You DECIEVED me! You said you came here to trade for an Unas! Not to claim one of your own!
0,93,8,DANNY,We just wanted to make sure he was HERE before we made an issue of it.
0,93,8,BURROCK,These beasts ... all of them ... bare my mark. Yours had no such identification.
0,93,8,DANNY,"Well, you heard him say my name."
0,93,8,BURROCK,I caught him in the wild at the other place.
0,93,8,DANNY,"Uh ... it was part of an experiment I was conducting ... sorry, but I ... really need him back."
0,93,8,BURROCK,I am sorry ... you can not have him.
0,93,9,TEAL'C,Does Colonel O'Neill require our assistance?
0,93,9,SAM,He hasn't signaled yet.
0,93,9,BURROCK,I could offer another Unas in exchange. This one is of good stock. And he's already trained.
0,93,9,DANNY,"You don't understand. This one's name is Chak'Ka, and he's Coming with me!"
0,93,10,JACK,Daniel ...
0,93,10,DANNY,Jack?
0,93,10,JACK,Why don't we discuss what we can offer the man in return. Shall we? Let's go outside.
0,93,11,CHAK'KA,Dan'El!!!!
0,93,12,JACK,"Daniel, we're NOT gonna get into a firefight over this right now."
0,93,12,BURROCK,"If you expect to trade for that Unas, it will NOT come cheap!"
0,93,12,JACK,So ... what your price?
0,93,12,BURROCK,2 Unas of equally pure lineage.
0,93,12,JACK,"2 for 1, eh?"
0,93,12,BURROCK,"Your Unas is worth it, or you would not have traveled all this way. Besides, you obviously have more sophisticated methods for capturing and trading them."
0,93,12,JACK,We'll ... think about it. Come on.
0,93,12,DANNY,"Excuse me. You uh ... have some sort of plan to do something about this, or ..."
0,93,12,JACK,"Well, right now, I'm not sure I'm gonna do anything."
0,93,12,DANNY,How can you say that?
0,93,12,JACK,"Daniel, you wanna go out and capture a couple Unas, trade 'em for Chak'Ka? Is that it?"
0,93,12,DANNY,I think you're missing the point here.
0,93,12,JACK,Am I?
0,93,12,DANNY,"You saw how they keep them, how they treat them."
0,93,12,JACK,"Daniel, I'm not saying any of this is right. I'm saying I don't know what to do about it."
0,93,12,DANNY,"I'm not asking you to change their way of life ... but ... Chak'Ka wasn't born in this kind of ... domestication. He's known freedom his whole life. The Unas of his planet live together in families, they love their children, they have arts!"
0,93,12,JACK,"Oh, yes, I've ... seen the cave drawings."
0,93,12,DANNY,I will not leave him here like this.
0,93,12,JACK,Even if it means risking human lives?
0,93,12,DANNY,"Well, we should be able to avoid that, shouldn't we?"
0,93,13,SAM,"So, what's going on?"
0,93,13,DANNY,"They're using Unas as slaves. They've been inbreeding so long, they've become untrainable. They needed new blood. They got Chak'Ka, and they're not giving him up."
0,93,13,SAM,"So, what are we gonna do?"
0,93,13,JACK,We'll wait until dark ... Daniel and I'll extract him. You'll provide cover ... and we're gonna do it without taking human lives.
0,93,14,BURROCK,Down! DOWN!
0,93,14,NIGHTTIME,
0,93,15,CHAK'KA,Chak'Ka! Chak'Ka!
0,93,15,UNAS,Chak'Ka!
0,93,16,DANNY,Chak'Ka!
0,93,16,CHAK'KA,Dan'El!
0,93,16,JACK,Tell him to move back.
0,93,16,DANNY,Chak'Ka.
0,93,16,JACK,He's not moving!
0,93,16,DANNY,Move back!
0,93,16,JACK,I could have said that!
0,93,16,DANNY,KeKa! KeKa! Danger!
0,93,17,JACK,"Oh, Crap! Come on! We gotta go!"
0,93,17,DANNY,"Come on, come on! No, It's"
0,93,17,CHAK'KA,Mou'Ta!
0,93,17,DANNY,What?! No! No Mou'Ta!
0,93,17,MOU'TA!!!!,
0,93,17,DANNY,"He says his friends won't ever forget. Come on, it's OK. Come on, Let's go!"
0,93,17,CHAK'KA,Mou'Ta! Mou'Ta!
0,93,17,DANNY,He says they're all marked for death.
0,93,17,JACK,"Daniel, with or without him ... we gotta"
0,93,18,SAM,Sir! You've got company.
0,93,19,SAM,There's ten men heading your way. We're laying down cover fire.
0,93,21,SAM,"Colonel, come in. Colonel? Do you read? Come in. Over."
0,93,21,DANNY,Chak'Ka must have grabbed that from my vest before it was taken away.
0,93,21,JACK,Why would he do that?
0,93,21,DANNY,Maybe he's seen me use it ... he knows what it's for ... Chak'Ka! Give.
0,93,21,CHAK'KA,Cose?
0,93,21,DANNY,"No, I don't know that word ... Cose? Give? Yes, yes, Chak'Ka! Ka! Give. Cose, cose. Thank you."
0,93,21,CHAK'KA,Ak'Ka!
0,93,21,DANNY,Ak'Ka ... thank you.
0,93,21,JACK,Danny ...
0,93,21,DANNY,"Right ... Sam, it's Daniel. Do you read?"
0,93,21,SAM,"Daniel, it's Sam ... are you"
0,93,21,DANNY,Uh ... I've been better.
0,93,21,SAM,Colonel O'Neill?
0,93,21,DANNY,"Uh ... physically fine. But, uh ... I'm not expecting a birthday present any time soon."
0,93,21,JACK,Cose! Cose.
0,93,21,DANNY,Chak'Ka? Cose.
0,93,22,JACK,Thank you. Carter? Report.
0,93,22,SAM,"There were too many of them, Sir. You ordered us not to shoot to kill. We couldn't stop them."
0,93,22,JACK,"Yeah, I know."
0,93,22,SAM,We're currently being pursued by search parties. We're attempting to get to the gate for reinforcement.
0,93,22,JACK,Roger that ... out.
0,93,22,CHAK'KA,Dan'El ... Chak'Ka!
0,93,22,DANNY,Chak'KA.
0,93,22,CHAK'KA,Akon Nan.
0,93,22,DANNY,Nan. Akon.
0,93,22,CHAK'KA,Akon Nan! KeKa!
0,93,22,DANNY,Ma' Ka!
0,93,22,CHAK'KA,Ma'Ka' Nan!
0,93,22,DANNY,
0,93,22,CHAK'KA,Sha'Nan! Shak'Ka!
0,93,22,JACK,What's he saying?
0,93,22,DANNY,"Well, actually that means a lot of different things. In this particular case, I'd say : ' Thank you for ... trying to free me. Sorry for getting you into this mess. '"
0,93,22,CHAK'KA,Chak'Ka!
0,93,22,JACK,Chaka ... full of nuts ... whatever.
0,93,22,DANNY,"Jack, it's not his fault."
0,93,22,JACK,Daniel ... I'm chained up ... in a madman's barn with a bunch of Unas ... who's to blame is not at the top of my list of concerns ... just yet.
0,93,22,CHAK'KA,Chak'Ka! Chak'KA!
0,93,22,UNAS,Chak'KA!
0,93,22,DANNY,That's amazing!
0,93,22,JACK,What?
0,93,22,DANNY,"Language, which is a learned behavior ... Chak'Ka must have ... taught this Unas that word. Chak'KA!"
0,93,22,UNAS,Chak'KA. Chak'Ka Zole.
0,93,22,UNAS OUTSIDE OF BARS,Chak'Ka Zole.
0,93,23,DANNY,They say Chak'Ka's their leader! They must recognize that he wouldn't leave without them.
0,93,23,JACK,"Daniel ... dogs sniff each other's butts, and they're friends for life ... we still keep them as pets."
0,93,23,DANNY,"No! No, this is different. Chak'Ka made a choice. The choice is FREEDOM. These Unas have placed their allegiance to him BECAUSE of that."
0,93,23,JACK,What are you saying?
0,93,23,DANNY,"I'm saying that they want to be free, they recognize what that means!"
0,93,23,JACK,All he said was 'Chak'Ka ZOLE! '
0,93,23,UNAS #1,Chak'Ka Zole!
0,93,23,UNAS #2,Chak'Ka
0,93,23,DANNY,"I was wrong! Chak'Ka ... Chak'Ka isn't different! These Unas may have been born into domestication, but they still know what freedom means, they KNOW it enough to WANT it!"
0,93,23,JACK,You said yourself. This is their way of life here.
0,93,23,DANNY,"Well, it has to change!"
0,93,23,JACK,How?
0,93,23,DANNY,"Well, we've meddled in other planet's cultures before ..."
0,93,23,JACK,"Well, now you're talking about moving in an ARMY !"
0,93,23,DANNY,I'd like to think that there was another way.
0,93,23,JACK,"Look. In principle, I agree with you"
0,93,24,BOY,You injured my father.
0,93,24,JACK,I'm sorry. I really am.
0,93,24,DANNY,We were just trying to take back an Unas that's rightfully ours.
0,93,24,BOY,Stealing is WRONG. )
0,93,24,JACK,"Yes, it is."
0,93,24,CHAK'KA,Chak'Ka! Chak'Ka KA!
0,93,25,JACK,"Trust me, Daniel. A whole LOT of people will have to die around here before one Unas goes free."
0,93,26,SAM,"Colonel, do you read?"
0,93,26,JACK,"Yeah, Carter. What's your situation?"
0,93,26,SAM,"We're at the gate Sir, but it's heavily guarded. We can attempt to get thru, but it's gonna get ugly."
0,93,26,JACK,Hold your position. Radio silence ... gotta go!
0,93,26,BURROCK,Beast stealing is punishable by death. It is my hope ... that THAT will not be necessary. But that will be up to you. I also know ... that there were others with you ... and that they may try to rescue you. That will NOT be wise. I will not hesitate to kill you.
0,93,26,DANNY,What do you want?
0,93,26,BURROCK,"Tell me of the places the Chappa'Ai can go ... I do not understand why you take such risks for this beast. He's very valuable to me, but certainly, you can replace him with one of equal lineage."
0,93,26,DANNY,"Because they're not beasts. They're self-aware, intelligent beings ... and you have no right ... to use them as slaves or treat them like you do."
0,93,26,BURROCK,"They used our forefathers as Slaves, and treated them far worse than we treat them now."
0,93,26,DANNY,And that makes you right?
0,93,26,BURROCK,What would YOU have us do?!
0,93,26,DANNY,Free them.
0,93,27,BURROCK,"Untrained, uncontrolled?! A beast would rip me limb from limb ... eat me alive!"
0,93,27,DANNY,"Then, send them to their home world."
0,93,27,BURROCK,"Our forefathers could have slaughtered them all ... but instead, They saw a way to use their strength to our advantage. A way to co-exist. For that, we thank them!"
0,93,27,DANNY,"But, you don't co-exist ... you use them as SLAVES."
0,93,27,JACK,"Look, we're not gonna tell you anything, so you might as well just let us go. We'll go back where we came from, You can go on doing what you do so well."
0,93,27,BURROCK,"Because now, I know for certain, there is more out there ..."
0,93,27,JACK,"Yeah, I know, the grass always looks cleaner. Fact is , there's a whole bunch of guys with glowing eyes out there ... you REALLY don't wanna mess with them."
0,93,28,SAM,Teal'C?
0,93,28,TEAL'C,I will not continue to do nothing.
0,93,28,SAM,What you gonna do? ... TEAL'C?! .
0,93,28,DANNY,
0,93,29,CHAK'KA KA!!!!,
0,93,31,BURROCK,
0,93,32,CHAK'KA,Chak'Ka! KA!!!!!
0,93,32,NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,)
0,93,33,BURROCK,Impressive weapon. But not as efficient as a fire stick. It seems to stop working after it's been fired for a while. I assume ... that's what these are for. Tell me how to make it work again.
0,93,33,JACK,Give it to me ... I'll SHOW you.
0,93,33,BURROCK,"It was simple enough to learn how to shoot it. I will learn this part as well. In the meantime, hunger and thirst will weaken you ... tomorrow, you will tell me what I need to know. I do not understand why ... but it seems that you care for Beasts ... more than you care for your own well being. So be it. Every morning and every night, I will come in here to learn what you know. If you do not tell me ... I will kill a beast. It may cost me ... but I believe it may be worth it. > Until tonight."
0,93,34,SAM,"Look, Teal'C. Maybe we can take out those 4 guys, but there's dozens more who'll be on us in SECONDS. Then we'll have to get thru the gate."
0,93,34,TEAL'C,Diversion.
0,93,34,JACK,"Yeah, Carter? I got ya."
0,93,34,SAM,"Sir, what's your status? We heard the shooting."
0,93,34,JACK,We're all right. Only an Unas took a hit.
0,93,34,SAM,Chak'Ka?
0,93,34,JACK,"No. No, he's OK. I thought I told you to hold your position at the gate."
0,93,34,SAM,"Yes, Sir. However, Teal'C thinks we may be able to create a big enough distraction to attempt a rescue, and I agree. However, we can't guarantee zero casualties. If that's still your concern, please advise, over."
0,93,34,JACK,I don't think we're gonna talk our way out of this one.
0,93,34,DANNY,"Well, for once, I'm not asking us to!"
0,93,34,JACK,"Dammit, Daniel."
0,93,34,DANNY,Let's get out of here ... all of us.
0,93,34,SAM,"Sir, still awaiting your orders."
0,93,34,JACK,"Yeah. We've got 3 Unas that are gonna be joining us ... Do what ya haveta do, Carter."
0,93,34,BURROCK,
0,93,35,MAN,
0,93,36,GET HIM!!!!,
0,93,37,JACK,Where's Teal'C?
0,93,37,SAM,Trying to be popular.
0,93,38,SAM,Stand back!
0,93,38,KE'KA!,
0,93,39,DANNY,Come on! Come on!
0,93,39,CHAK'KA,
0,93,40,HEY!,
0,93,41,DANNY,Chak'Ka! It's OK! Chak'Ka! ... Kanic ... Friend.
0,93,41,CHAK'KA,Friend.
0,93,42,JACK,I thought you said the gate was heavily guarded.
0,93,42,TEAL'C,Maybe they've all gone into town to help douse the fire.
0,93,42,JACK,Or we got an ambush here. Hey! Hey! Stop!
0,93,42,DANNY,Ke'KA! Chak'KA! Ke'Ka! I think he understands why we stopped.
0,93,42,JACK,All right ... fan out! Cover em!
0,93,43,CHAK'KA!,
0,93,44,DANNY,Chak'KA! NOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0,93,45,SAM,"We're all clear, Sir. Teal'C's dialing the gate. We should hurry ... there might be more men coming."
0,93,45,DANNY,"Chak'Ka! Come on, we're ... uh ... taking you home. No Nan ... Home. No na! ) We did all this to save you. I don't think he ever intended to come with us. He thought he was helping US escape."
0,93,45,SAM,So what does he want to do?
0,93,45,DANNY,Stay and fight to free the others.
0,93,45,JACK,"Daniel, we didn't come here to arm them."
0,93,45,DANNY,"Well, they did that themselves. I don't think we're gonna stop them. Ka'Kek. Chak'Ka."
0,93,46,JACK,You sent em out to start a war.
0,93,46,DANNY,"Well, it was his choice. I told them they didn't have to kill."
0,93,46,JACK,You think he understands that?
0,93,46,DANNY,They know what freedom is and are willing to fight for it. They deserve a chance.
